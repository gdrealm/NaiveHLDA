Such vulnerability, and the need for resilience in the face of such threats, is recognised widely - see Building Britain's Future17 and the ICE's State of The Nation Report: Defending Critical Infrastructure18 (both 2009), and the aims of the new Infrastructure UK delivery body18. This feasibility study seeks to explore radically different ways of conceptualising, designing, constructing, maintaining, managing, adapting and valuing the physical infrastructure to make it resilient no matter which threats are manifested or how the future develops. In this context resilience refers to the symbiosis existing between infrastructure, management systems and end users.Recent years have witnessed a shift to a more transdisciplinary concept of resilience that integrates the physical (both built and natural) and socio-political aspects of resilience. This change has been crucial because the socio-political and managerial aspects are arguably as important to the attainment of resilience as the physical aspects; resilient engineering also demands a more resilient infrastructural context with regard to the professions and the structures and processes which govern engineering activity.This proposal explores the engineering and social dimensions of resilience research needed to bring about radical changes in thinking and practice for an assured future in the face of multiple challenges. The following represent two core resilience themes at the interface of engineering, spatial planning and social science, from which feasibility studies to address key challenges will emerge via a series of workshops. The tangible manifestation lies in Local Area Agreements - a set of 32 centrally-approved and locally-implemented performance indicators linking engineered solutions, mechanisms for adoption, behavioural adaptation and education.1. Bespoke local utility infrastructures for resilient communities2. The role of transport in societal resilienceThe research team draws from five major research groups at the University of Birmingham, all of whom are addressing core themes of infrastructure and resilience. The team is supported by innovative thinkers drawn from the stakeholder community, both practitioners and policy makers. The primary themes to be studied are the creation of local utility infrastructures and transport to deliver resilience, recognising the UK shift towards enhancing innovation in the public/private sectors and local decision-making and delivery. Our team will deepen trans-disciplinary research by overcoming the tension that exists between the engineering focus on solutions and the social scientists concern with problems by developing realistic solutions to local problems. This requires exploration of the interface between four communities of practice: engineering and physical sciences, social sciences, private firms and local government. The intention is to identify solutions that reduce costs and enhance delivery, but also to identify new projects that have the potential to create innovative products that have commercial value.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I016163/1","grantId":"EP/I016163/1","fundValue":"202743","fundStart":"2010-11-01","fundEnd":"2012-04-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The CDFA team held its first meeting of the Practitioner Forum on the 5 April 2011 to identify issues of critical importance with regard to local infrastructure (with a focus on transport and utilities) and resilience and to scope the first two of four proposed feasibility studies.

To do this a review of resilience was undertaken from four different perspectives:\n\nEcological resilience – the magnitude of disturbance that can be absorbed before a system changes its structure.\n\nEconomic resilience – the inherent and adaptive responses to disasters that enable individuals and communities avoid some potential losses.\n\nInfrastructure resilience – the ability of a system or organisation to withstand and recover from adversity.\n\nCommunity and social resilience – the capacity of an individual, community or system to adapt so as to sustain an acceptable level of function, structure and identity\n\n\n\nFour feasibility studies were then drafted and eventually amalgamated into three:\n\n1. Bottom-up Resilience: The third sector, local communities and Critical Local Infrastructures (CLIs).\n\n2. Evaluating and Modelling Resilience of Critical Local Infrastructure Systems.\n\n3. Integrating Local Infrastructure with Local, National, European and Global Infrastructure. Practitioners can use underpinning research to influence their thinking in the area of critical local infrastructure. Indeed, such impact has already taken place with workshops held with the Worcester Partnership and Birmingham City Council. The purpose of the arising large grant will be to materially influence policy. The three feasibility studies described above are currrently being combined into one potential programme of research from which a large grant application is being drafted for submission to EPSRC. The outcomes from this programme of research will be used to influence school curricula as well as being able to be incorporated into Master's programmes.
