Our primary focus will be on traits that are essential for sustainable, environmentally benign crop production in the face of climate change. We propose to achieve this by combining high throughput genomics with traditional skills in genetics and phenotyping (measuring the physical properties of the plants and the corresponding crop).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E024726/1","grantId":"BB/E024726/1","fundValue":"394729","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-04-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The information on loci linked to straw strength have been followed up by a partner lab working on lignin biosynthesis Agriculture, Food and Drink Economic","person":"Andrew J Flavell","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Dundee","findingsText":" Collections of barley have been assembled. A 395 cultivar collection was genetically characterised with a new Illumina iSelect 7864 SNP high-throughput molecular marker system.16 important traits related to crop yield and sustainability have been scored in field trials across Europe. Association genetics has been carried out revealing regions of the barley genome that control traits related to straw strength. The majority of information obtained in this project is of direct relevance to the crop breeder. The markers and information on loci encoding useful traits can be used for crop improvement by molecular breeding. Knowledge of the genetic makeup of modern barley informs the breeder whether they can expect improvement using crosses between existing cultivars or whether they should look to import new germplasm into their crosses.
