By bringing scholars, students and practitioners of the Jewish and Muslim experience together, current comparative research can be presented and the possibilities for future studies explored.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=119561/1","grantId":"119561/1","fundValue":"9950","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2006-12-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Humayun  Ansari","coPersons":["David  Cesarani"],"organisation":"Royal Holloway, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
