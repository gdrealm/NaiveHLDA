Indeed, the sector is heavily reliant upon relatively crude and expensive financial instruments to convert long-term goals into changes in practice, and subsequent regulatory regimes to deliver compliance. </p>\n\n<p>This research takes an alternative focus by seeking to understand the ways in which the working practices of rural land managers frame climate change, and developing new forms of engagement, using Participatory Action Research (PAR) as a means of developing adaptation strategies to environmental change. The research will: </p>\n\n<ol>\n \n\n <li>Review how engagement is being done with farming communities by organisations such as the EA, DEFRA, FWAG, NFU and rivers trusts; </li>\n\n <li>Explore how novel forms of PAR can be used to build networks and capacity for rural land management; </li>\n\n <li>Provide guidance on how PAR can re-frame critical policy issues in ways that better reflect the experiences and aspirations of land managers.</li>\n</ol>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-240-25-0004","grantId":"RES-240-25-0004","fundValue":"153120","fundStart":"2010-07-01","fundEnd":"2012-04-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Stuart Nicholas LaneRachel  Pain","coPersons":["David  Milledge"],"organisation":"Durham University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
