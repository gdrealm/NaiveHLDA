When a region of the brain becomes active the neurons increase their activity. An increased flow of oxygen is required in that local region to fuel this activity. Since oxygenated (fresh) and de-oxygenated blood have different magnetic properties, it is possible to use the ratio of these two substances to measure changes in neural activity. \n\nYou may have seen ?Magic Eye? pictures in which an object ?jumps? out in depth from the page of a book. This is because there is a slight difference in the images going to the two eyes: it is known as stereoscopic depth perception. Using stimuli similar to these Magic Eye pictures, we can employ fMRI to investigate which areas of the human brain are responsible for producing this depth percept from the small differences in the images. \n\nDeficits in depth perception are common, as any misalignment of the two eyes during early childhood due to ?squint? or ?lazy eye? can prevent the development of neurons that receive input from both eyes. Although the eyes can be realigned surgically, most children do not regain their binocular vision. Once we have established the areas of the brain involved in depth perception, it will be possible to compare the effectiveness of different treatments for these deficits.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0400132","grantId":"G0400132","fundValue":"196654","fundStart":"2005-09-15","fundEnd":"2008-09-14","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Andrew John  Parker","coPersons":["Holly  Bridge"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
