{"id":"1D4BA4DC-A4B6-408D-A08B-9992E6E1C124","title":"CP2K-UK","abstractText":"CP2K is a state-of-the-art software package for atomistic simulation using Density Functional Theory and related methods, with a wide range of capabilities and excellent performance that can be used to address problems in the fields of materials science, computational chemistry and biochemistry. However, despite these advantages, the code presents a formidable learning curve for new users, with the result that many groups choose to use other codes, or are simply unable to tackle highly complex and demanding modelling problems.\n\nWe propose to create a network 'CP2K-UK' for UK researchers to build increased capability to both use effectively and develop or extend CP2K in their research. The network will be led by a collaboration between EPCC, UCL and KCL. The investigators Bethune (EPCC), Slater and Watkins (UCL) have strong track records in CP2K development - to date, the only UK contributors to the code. They will support a development project in the Kantorovich group (KCL), training a PDRA in the essential software development skills to successfully add new functionality to CP2K.\n\nThe development project will implement new algorithms to extend the ability of CP2K to simulate larger and more complex systems which are of key importance to UK research today, for example: understanding the function of large biomolecules, porous systems such as zeolites and Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs), design of new materials for fuel cells, nanotechnology including scanning probe microscopies, and next-generation catalysts to create fuels from solar radiation.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K038222/1","grantId":"EP/K038222/1","fundValue":"253403","fundStart":"2013-09-01","fundEnd":"2018-08-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The implementation of Generalised Langevin Dynamics with thermal regions have been used by a research group at King's College London.

This work concerns mainly on the development of the software in terms of both improvement in functionality as well as efficiency.\n\n- Implementation of Generalised Langevin Dynamics with thermal region support: The standard ab initio molecular dynamics simulation assumes box of particles with a constant total energy (NVE); to simulate a box that is connected to a heat bath and has a constant temperature (NVT), a thermostat will have to be used during the simulation. This generally involves adding and subtracting fictitious forces to the motion of particles in such a way that overall dynamics will obey the Boltzmann distribution (canonical ensemble). Langevin dynamics is one such approach, with the kinetic energy being added into and taken out of the system via a random distribution. The original version of the CP2K has Langevin dynamics implemented for all of the particles in the simulation cell. The improvement allowed different regions of the simulation cell to be defined, each can perform either Langevin NVT dynamics with a set temperature or NVE dynamics. This allows stochastic boundary conditions (Langevin dynamics only for atoms in the buffer region between the system of interest and the heat bath) calculations (L. Kantorovich, Phys. Rev. B 78, 094304 (2008)) to be carried out.\n\n- Implementation of multiple atomic lists in fragment definition for Basis Set Superposition Error (BSSE) calculations: The original implementation of CP2K allows only one atomic list in the definition of a structural fragment. Since the CP2K list input format can only allow one continuous list for the atomic indices (e.g. atoms 1..5 meaning 1, 2, 3, 4, 5), it can become a hassle for users to define complex fragments that may involve atoms from several continuous lists with gaps in between---they will have to reorganise the atoms in their input file which may be extremely inconvenient. This a minor improvement which allows the fragment to be defined by several lists if necessary, thus removing the user hassle to reorder atoms in their model.\n\nAnother objective of this project in collaboration with developers in the UK (EPCC) and in Switzerland (UZH, ETHZ, PSI) to improve user interface and documentation. For this, so far:\n\n- We have written an emacs major mode for the CP2K input file. This has been made available and put into the public domain (GitHub), and is linked to the CP2K website.\n- We have written several tutorials on how to perform basic and some more advanced calculations using CP2K and published the tutorials onto the main CP2K website, which is available to the public.\n- We have contributed to the training courses for CP2K organised by our EPCC collaborators.\n\nWe have also attended the CompMat2014, where we have given a lecture introducing CP2K to a wider audience in the Chemistry and Material Science field. The development on the software will be on-going. As well as tutorials and help materials for the users, we are presently in the process of providing help materials for developers such as descriptions of the API functions in the DBCSR sparse matrix algebra library used by CP2K, and the parallel strategy and data structures currently implemented in the code. These types of information are expected to help to speedup future developments of the software and help new developers to become familiar with the code, and are something at the moment that is very much lacking. New functionalities that has been developed in this project, which is still on-going, will be advertised both in the user mailing lists and the training courses to raise awareness when they become available. For this purpose, a CP2K meeting is currently being organised in London to be held on the 6th of February 2015.
