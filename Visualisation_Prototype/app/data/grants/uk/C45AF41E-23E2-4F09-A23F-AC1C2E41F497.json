First, we developed a new approach for the synthesis of important amino acids, including ones containing hindered, so called quaternary carbon centres which are very hard to make using existing methods. Next, we used a similar approach to allow access to chiral amidoallenes, compounds containing two carbon-carbon double bonds directly linked to each other. These can also exist as two mirror image forms, and for the first time, we were able to show that these can be made as single isomers by transferring the stereochemical information from a carbon-sulfur bond to the newly formed amidoallene. Finally, we began to explore using the strategy to make alpha-amidophosphonates, which are of considerable interest as mimics of peptides. This is important since peptides have many potential medicinal applications, but are unstable in the body. Amidophosphonates potentially can have similar biological properties but greater stability. Proof-of-concept has been established for the use of our new approach to synthesise these compounds, and the chemistry will be fully exploited in ongoing studies. New synthesis methods of this type are constantly required by key industries such as fine chemicals, agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals. As well as offering improved (cleaner, cheaper) synthesis routes, the availability of new methods can inspire the design of new molecular architectures with immense potential to improve human health and crop security. The types of molecule made here (containing nitrogen atoms and mimicking bioactive compounds) are of wide interest to both academia and industry.
