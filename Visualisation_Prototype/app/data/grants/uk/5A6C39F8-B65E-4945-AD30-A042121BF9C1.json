Too much fat in obesity results from a combination of increased lipid storage in existing fat cells and the generation of new fat cells from precursors cells. Recently, the direct importance of fat tissue in the control of body weight has become recognised. This is because the fat cells, in addition to lipid storage, can produce a wide range of proteins that regulate the total amount of body fat and different biological processes, including appetite and metabolism. Our recent work has found that a protein called zinc-alpha2-glycoprotein (ZAG) is also made by fat cells. ZAG production in fat cells is inversely related to the amount of body fat, being reduced in obesity while greatly increased in mice with little fat. Our subsequent work in these mice indicates that overproduction of ZAG is associated with a major reduction in several key genes and proteins involved in making new fat cells. However, it is unclear whether ZAG acts directly to influence this process. The aim of this project is to test our new idea that ZAG has a major role in limiting the expansion of fat mass, especially in the control of the number of fat cells and lipid accumulation during the formation of new fat cells. To examine this idea, we will study to what extent ZAG modifies the early and late events of making new fat cells, by analysing the effects of ZAG on the key factors, particularly those promoting fat cell formation and development. We will also examine whether ZAG influences lipid storing capacity through altering lipid accumulation in fat cells, and whether ZAG treatment reduces fat mass expansion in obesity, using an obese mouse model. Given, the current high interest in body fat regulation, clarification of the mechanisms by which ZAG hinders fat cell formation will give important new insights into the control of body fat. Recently, a report by the UK Government Foresight Group has suggested that Britain could be a mainly obese society by 2050; this research is therefore very timely and the findings may ultimately lead to new treatments for protecting against body fat accumulation in obesity. The progress and findings of this research will be transmitted to the general public through publications, meetings, press releases by the University and public awareness events.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0801226","grantId":"G0801226","fundValue":"308629","fundStart":"2009-04-01","fundEnd":"2012-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Chen  Bing","coPersons":["Paul  Trayhurn"],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
