Each nerve cell has hundreds to thousands of synapses that connect the neurons in the brain into networks of immense complexity. The synapse is considered to be the fundamental functional unit of the nervous system and performs the role of transmitting the electrical information or activity in one nerve cell to the next, typically by releasing neurotransmitters across the synaptic cleft. Neurotransmitters and their receptors are defective in many brain diseases and are also the target of the majority of drugs used to treat brain diseases. Moreover, these synaptic neurotransmitters are affected by drugs of abuse. Understanding the human synapse is clearly important for human disease.\n\nDespite the central importance of synapses, surprisingly little is known about human synapses. The main objective of this project is to identify the proteins that comprise human synapses and study their differences in parts of the brain and between species. We will focus on key sets of proteins at synapses that bind together and form ?multiprotein complexes?. These are molecular machines that detect patterns of electrical activity in the synapse and control learning and memory and many other behaviours. The proteins that comprise these machines are involved in many human brain diseases and are of great potential as therapeutic targets for future medicines.\n\nThe information from this research will be disseminated freely and be important for driving future research programs. The explanation of the experiments and their implications will also be made available to the public through an educational website (http://www.g2conline.org/).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0802238","grantId":"G0802238","fundValue":"2465000","fundStart":"2010-01-01","fundEnd":"2015-07-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Seth  Grant","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
