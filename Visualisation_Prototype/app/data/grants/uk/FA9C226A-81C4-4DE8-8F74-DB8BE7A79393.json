{"id":"FA9C226A-81C4-4DE8-8F74-DB8BE7A79393","title":"Atomistic modelling and experimental verification of vitrified matrices for waste encapsulation","abstractText":"The encapsulation of spent nuclear waste and its storage over many years is a crucial aspect of nuclear energy technology. It is vital that this process is reliable and scientifically proven to be stable over the expected lifetime in which the waste remains active. Public confidence in nuclear energy will only be enhanced if this process can be proved to be safe and environmentally sound. However the required storage times for many spent fuel waste forms is so much longer than the 60 years or so that waste has so far been produced by nuclear power that it is not possible to verify this by direct experimental observation.\n\nThis proposal is based on developing computer models of the radiation induced structural changes in the encapsulation materials over long time scales. The main materials to be investigated are borosilicate and iron phosphate glasses and there will also be experimental verification of the models for these materials. Borosilicate glasses are typically used but iron phosphate may be a new candidate waste form that could enhance high level waste loading.\n\nUsing a combination of computer models and experiments to investigate these encapsulation materials, we will be able to make predictions that will enable engineers to choose the most appropriate materials for long time structural integrity and help boost public confidence in this vital part of nuclear technology.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K007882/1","grantId":"EP/K007882/1","fundValue":"501148","fundStart":"2013-01-01","fundEnd":"2016-06-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Roger  Smith","coPersons":["Neil  Hyatt"],"organisation":"Loughborough University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
