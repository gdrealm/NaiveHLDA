{"id":"54E6B410-1FA4-4F38-A744-7FF434F478CE","title":"Onscenity: Sex, Commerce, Media and Technology in Contemporary Society","abstractText":"This research network draws together international experts in order to respond to the new visibility or 'onscenity' of sex in commerce, culture and everyday life. It responds to public concerns about a range of issues including the new accessibility of pornography, the mainstreaming and normalization of sexually explicit representation, the commercialization of sex, the role of the internet in circulating 'extreme' images, and the use of communication technologies, often by young people, for sexual purposes. It is supported by leading academics in the field and will draw together scholars from Europe, the US, Hong Kong and Australia.\\n \\nThe aim of the network is to investigate the ways in which sex is increasingly intertwined with commerce, the media and new technology in our lives. We live in a changing landscape surrounded by media, where our use of technologies is changing the way we live and offering new opportunities and new risks. Sex is presented as central to our experiences of identity and relationships, and it is increasingly a part of the lifestyle and leisure practices of a consumer culture where many forms of commercial sex have experienced unprecedented and global growth. Media and communication technologies are widely used as information resources about sex, to access pornography and other sex-entertainment materials, and increasingly to fashion home made sexual representations and experience new types of sexual encounter in virtual environments. \\n\\nIt is now necessary to develop new approaches and research questions about the relationship between sex, commerce, media and technology and new research is needed. We need to develop a coherent and well-informed body of work that can underpin public, policy and legislative debates around the world. Drawing on the work of leading scholars from around the world, the network contributes to the development of these by mapping a transformed landscape of sexual practices and by co-ordinating a new wave of research.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/H03370X/2","grantId":"AH/H03370X/2","fundValue":"7205","fundStart":"2012-09-24","fundEnd":"2013-01-23","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  I have drawn on this project in order to contribute to public and practitioner debates about sexualization. I gave a presentation to practitioners, 'The Sexualization Debate and Women's Sexual Leisure' to the College of Sexual and Relationship Therapists Conference, in London, November 2011, and two presentations to the public 'Asking the Right Questions about the Sex Industry', Keele World Affairs Group, in November 2012 and 'Sex and the Media', ThinkCon, Cambridge Science Festival, in March 2013. The Sexual Cultures 2 conference to be held in London, in April 2015, focuses on the intersection of political activism and academic work and has foregrounded a series of plenary sessions focused on discussions between academics and activists.

The network focused on the ways in which sex is increasingly intertwined with commerce, the media and\nnew technology in our lives. It considered how to develop new approaches and research questions about the relationship between sex, commerce, media and technology and co-ordinate a new wave of research. During its funding period a number of events were organized to increase knowledge exchange amongst\nacademics at workshops and seminars and at an international conference. The work of the network has been taken forward in increased collaboration between academics working in this area. It has also provided a basis for developing links with practitioners, for example in the group Sense about Sex and in further funded projects. A second conference drawing on the work of the network is to be held in 2015. The project led to a greater involvement of a number of network members in the leading critical sexuality studies journal Sexualities and to the creation of a new journal Porn Studies. A Routledge Companion on Media, Sex and Sexuality has also resulted from collaboration between network members.
