International leadership and participation in multi-institute collaborations requires a vibrant Visitors Programme, in order to sustain a competitive advantage, cross-fertilise skillsets with overseas expertise, and foster new and exciting collaborative links when time-critical targets of opportunity arise. Visitor Programmes are particularly cost-effective in this regard; the efficacy (and importance) of our previous grant is demonstrated graphically by the fact that 1/3 of the Centre for Astrophysics 200 refereed publications since 2003 were written in collaboration with the 35 visitors supported by the grant. This application seeks to expand upon our previously-supported Visitors Programme, to reflect our rapid and significant growth in High Performance Computational Astrophysics, while maintaining support for our existing international links within the stellar and solar physics themes. Examples of research projects involving visitors include fully self-consistent cosmological chemical and dynamical simulations of galaxy formation; age-dating and chemical deconstruction of ancient galaxies throughout the Universe; tracking the origin sites of the chemical elements and isotopes surrounding us today; understanding the growth of supermassive black holes through observations and models of their neighbouring visible star cluster companions; probing the interiors of stars using sound waves; uncovering the mysterious origin of coronal mass ejections; exploring the link between coronal holes on the Sun, their solar winds, and their interaction with the Earth's atmosphere.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/G003025/1","grantId":"ST/G003025/1","fundValue":"28730","fundStart":"2009-04-15","fundEnd":"2012-04-14","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Bradley Kenneth Gibson","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Central Lancashire","findingsText":" We have quantified the role that dust has in shaping the colours and appearances of distant galaxies, and for the fist time, been able to include the effects that energy from exploding stars have upon the structure of galaxies like our Milky Way. As part of the Kepler Mission, we have discovered a new class of binary star and shed new light on the mysterious objects which likely are responsible for mysterious Type Ia supernovae. The role of feedback in shaping galaxy evolution must be explored in a more statistical sense; we have helped shaped the international efforts by implementing feedback from exploding stars in a new and unique manner, resulting in systems which, for the first time, look like the Milky Way. The next step must be the gathering of a statistical sample of simulations, spanning a range of masses and assembly histories, in order to assess the veracity of our energy scheme.
