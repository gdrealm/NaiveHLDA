The interest in this question stems from the fact that if individuals can be helped to stay longer in work, they can gain valuable work experience, acquire new skills, increase their earnings, enjoy greater employment stability and so on. If, on the other hand, increased overall employment resulted largely from increased employment entry, ERA would have done little to address the low-pay no-pay cycle. \n\nIn the UK, ERA was found to increase unemployment exit but not to affect retention. Prolonged unemployment spells can damage longer-term prospects. By shortening unemployment spells, ERA had a more prolonged effect on the long-term unemployed (Dorsett, 2014)\n\nThe US trials were in Corpus Christi and Forth Worth. In Corpus Christi, the sustained positive impact on employment was due to both employment retention and employment entry effects but the retention effect faded over time. In Fort Worth, there were smaller effects. There was some indication that employment retention might have been improved, but only in the short-term (Dorsett, Hendra and Robins, 2014). \n\nComparing lone parents in the UK and the US, the larger impacts in the US cannot be explained by differences in observed characteristics. Rather, unobserved characteristics appear important; ERA worked better for those who would otherwise be slower to enter work and less well for those who would otherwise be slower to leave work. The fact that these groups are present in different proportions in Texas and the UK accounts for much of the difference in observed impacts. \n\nWe also found that, in the UK, ERA impacts were greater in offices that emphasised in-work advancement, support while working and financial bonuses for sustained employment, and also in those offices that assigned more caseworkers to ERA participants. Offices that encouraged further education\nhad smaller employment impacts (Dorsett and Robins, 2014).\n\nLastly, we provide some evidence that providing temporary support in this way may harm well-being in the long-run (Dorsett and Oswald, 2014). The results provide some guidance for the development of policy. They highlight the difficulty of increasing retention. However, ERA-type interventions have been shown to have positive impacts. The findings identify particular features of ERA in the UK that were associated with effectiveness. Lastly, the results caution that such interventions may have unexpected negative impacts on well-being. This is an important finding and suggests that relevant evidence from other studies should be examined. Government, Democracy and Justice","dataset":"gtr"}
