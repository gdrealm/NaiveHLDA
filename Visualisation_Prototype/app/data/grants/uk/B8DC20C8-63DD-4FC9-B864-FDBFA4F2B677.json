{"id":"B8DC20C8-63DD-4FC9-B864-FDBFA4F2B677","title":"Medieval Latin Dictionary from British Sources","abstractText":"The Dictionary of Medieval Latin from British Sources is a unique work of historical reference, based upon the largest\\ncorpus of named authors and the largest archive of literary, archival, and epigraphic sources anywhere in Europe. It\\ncovers not only the usages of the Classical Latin and Late Latin periods (from the beginnings to AD 200 and 200-600),\\nbut the entire period of the Middle Ages: the 1100 years from the sixth century to the sixteenth. It records in the standard\\nformat of the Oxford English Dictionary and the Oxford Latin Dictionary head-words, etymologies, definitions, and\\nquotations that illustrate usage, documenting a complete range from high literary to archival and even demotic registers,\\nincorporating words borrowed from a uniquely wide variety of other languages / Greek, Semitic, Celtic, Germanic, and\\nRomance. As the Dictionary often illustrates use in Latin of vernacular words hundreds of years before their recorded use\\nin vernacular texts, the work is essential to the study of medieval and modern languages and literatures as well as the\\nlong history of Latin. Even before its completion the Dictionary has established itself as pre-eminent, with widely\\nacknowledged usefulness to students of language, literature, history, philosophy, genealogy, music, art and architecture,\\nnumismatics, onomastics, topography, and to editors and translators of texts.\\nIts completion and online availability by 2014 by a combination of AHRC and Packard Humanities Institute funding will be an achievement of\\ninternational importance. The Dictionary will be able to cover specific British vocabularies not dealt with in other editions.\\nIt will serve as primary and essential reference volume to the academy.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/I022841/1","grantId":"AH/I022841/1","fundValue":"488182","fundStart":"2011-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-09-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  The Medieval Latin Dictionary from British Sources is a crucial resource for anyone conducting research in (not just British) medieval studies. Since it is a basic reference work intended to cover a period of approximately a millenium, anyone who wishes to study literary works, documents of any kind, and inscriptions written in Latin during the relevant period will find it a useful and indispensable resource. The planned digitisation of the project (in two formats, one of which will be free at the point of use) will significantly increase its reach.

The DMLBS serves as the primary reference book for those who want access to the literary, diplomatic, and epigraphic monuments of Latin as written in the British Isles during the 1100 years from Gildas in the sixth century to Camden in the sixteenth. The dictionary is primarily a tool which helps with the analysis and understanding of medieval Latin texts and documents of any kind.
