A major part of bringing this to completion will be a reconsideration of the wider landscape around the monument, focussing on the development of the ceremonial landscape (e.g. patterns of visibility and movement) from the Neolific to the LBA. This itself requires an updated synthesis of the environmental development of the landscape from later Mesolific woodland through predominantly open LBA landscape and will draw on a range of molluscan, pollen and environmental evidence to create formal vegetation maps and models.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=112851/1","grantId":"112851/1","fundValue":"10510","fundStart":"2006-02-07","fundEnd":"2006-05-06","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"David  Wheatley","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
