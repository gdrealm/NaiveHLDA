For stimulation of the canonical pathway, both proteins have been found to interact with a component of an assembly of proteins known as the IKK complex that is thought to act as a molecular switch. Our studies will focus on how the host protein recognises this component (since this has already been done for the viral protein in a previous study) and how the molecular switch toggles between on and off states. To achieve this, we will use a technique known as protein crystallography that will enable us visualise the host protein bound to the IKK component in 3 dimensions and also the IKK component in isolation allowing comparison. This should ultimately aid in the design of novel anti-cancer drugs that specifically inhibit the transition. We aim to perform similar studies with our target proteins and components of the non-canonical pathway.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0701236","grantId":"G0701236","fundValue":"388686","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Tracey  Barrett","coPersons":["Christopher William Kay"],"organisation":"Birkbeck College","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
