Normally the procedure dramatically improves the quality of life for the recipient, eliminating the debilitating pain and restoring mobility. The implant would normally be expect to last for 10 to 20 years, in the standard patient, aged something over 60 years old. However, as a result of the success of the procedure, increasing numbers of individuals are requesting this procedure from a ever increasingly youthful population. With increasing life expectancy and this new group of younger patients, the demands on the performance of the prosthesis are ever increasing. Metal on metal prostheses have been shown to be an exciting new area for resurfacing and total hip replacements, reducing problems of osteolysis associated with the standard, metal on polymer implant, as well as allowing larger diameter prostheses to be used permitting a greater range of movement and less risk of dislocation. However, problems have been identified related to the biological response to both the metal particles and also the metal ion release and therefore there is a motivation to reduce both. This project will develop, test and study the properties of new nanocomposite, wear and ion release resistant PVD bioactive coatings, to meet the rigorous demands of the hip joint application. Performance will be assessed on a hip wear simulator to evaluate the longevity of the surface modifications. The nanoparticles generated in the hip wear simulator will be evaluated using state-of-the-art analytical methods. In addition to reducing wear and ion release, the nanocomposite coatings will offer novel multifunctional benefits of self-lubrication, antimicrobial properties and improved bedding in of the bearing surfaces. This proposal is a unique opportunity to further develop industry and university collaborations generated by: (1) the interdisciplinary nature of the group; (2) new developments in nanotoxicology; (3) coordinated, multifield testing of nanoparticles, including novel methods of assessing benefits and risks to health of humans from exposure to nanoparticles. This proposal will lead to the development of safer and more durable hip replacements. Moreover, the technology will also be applicable to other joint replacements and other articulating medical devices, including interspinal disc replacements.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=DT/F007183/1","grantId":"DT/F007183/1","fundValue":"198367","fundStart":"2008-04-01","fundEnd":"2011-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Used in the development of new nanocomposite tribological coatings Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Transport Societal,Economic","person":"Allan  Matthews","coPersons":["Adrian  Leyland"],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":" We confirmed the benefits of adding antibacterial/antimicrobial elements into coatings for prosthetic devices to avoid the psuedotumour problem.
