{"id":"C4CDA3D1-C51A-4241-ABB2-F401BC722C9D","title":"Engineering Autonomous Space Software","abstractText":"This proposal is based on two premises: that (1) increased autonomy is essential for future space exploration; (2) that existing programming methods are tedious to apply to autonomous components that have to handle an environment with continuous state variables. For well defined discrete-event environments the above rational agent approach is well developed; for a continuous environment, however, perception processes need to be linked with abstractions forming the basis of behaviour. As the environment changes, the abstracted models may also change. Hence, agents are needed that can use these abstractions to aid their decision making processes, use these in the predictive modelling of a continuous world, and connect these abstractions to both planning and goal achievement within rational agents.This project also intends to replace the current complex programming techniques, used for autonomous spacecraft control, with simpler declarative programming. High-level, declarative agent programming languages have been investigated at Liverpool and such theories and languages will be developed further for agents that require predictive modelling capabilities. The Southampton team is experienced both in the formal handling of analytical and empirical models for control and prediction, and in developing control software for real satellites. The merging of these themes is very promising. Although the results will be transferable to ground vehicles and robots, this project will particularly illustrate the new methods in space applications, both in simulation and laboratory hardware demonstrations.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F037570/1","grantId":"EP/F037570/1","fundValue":"420619","fundStart":"2008-12-01","fundEnd":"2012-05-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Sandor Mihaly Veres","coPersons":["Stephen Bernard Gabriel"],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
