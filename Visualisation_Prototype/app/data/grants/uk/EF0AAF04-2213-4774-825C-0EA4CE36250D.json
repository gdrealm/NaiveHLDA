There are some suggestions that not all the fats are equal and that there is good and bad fat with respect to their effects in the body. Not too much is known about what fat normally does in the cells of the body. We know that fat can be stored, burned, been sent from one organ to another within the body and more importantly fat are important 'bricks' to build up the different components of the cells. Interestingly not all the fats have the same size, the length of some fats is longer than others and we think that the length of the fat species may be an important determinant whether fat is stored or burn. The best organ to study this is a special type of organ known as brown fat present in children and small animals. This organ can do both, making fat and burning fat so it is the ideal organ to investigate the effect of fat length on these two processes. To study fat length we will investigate the effect of lack and/or excess of Elovl6, a molecule that elongates fat from 12 carbons to 18 carbons. Specifically we propose to investigate: 1) if making fat longer can alter the development of the brown fat organ; b) whether eliminating/increasing the capacity of elongating fat makes the animals fatter/leaner and c) less/more capable of making heat. To that end we will use cells and mice in which we will decrease or increase the capacity to make fat longer and then study the type of fat these animals make using very novel techniques that allow us to know all the types of fats that these animals will have. This information will inform us about which fats are good and which ones are bad and will allow us, for example, to modify the diets of humans and animals to ensure that they have the right type of fats to remain healthy.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/H002731/1","grantId":"BB/H002731/1","fundValue":"513407","fundStart":"2009-10-01","fundEnd":"2012-09-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Our data indicate that faty acid chain lenght is essential for thermogenesis and also is a factor en human obesity.

To that end we utilised the elovl6 KO mouse as a model with altered fatty acid elongation. Elovl6 was well suited to this roll, as it is expressed at much higher levels in brown adipose tissue than any other tissue. Elovl6 is regulated by thermogenic challenges and is upregulated by cold exposure and reduced by thermoneutral housing. Unlike previous studies of elongation and its roll in BAT function by studying Elovl3, Elovl6 do not have an obvious skin barrier defect, removing the confounding factor of poor thermal insulation on studies of BAT function. \n\n\n\nIn line with the concept that Elovl6 was important for brown adipose tissue function we have identified that Elovl6 KO mice have a temperature dependent post natal survival. At 20oC, as reported previously, only 30% of Elovl6 KO pups survive to 3 weeks of age. However, this is not embryonic lethality as reported but instead is a temperature dependent post-natal lethality. The mendelian ratios of elovl6 KO mice can be corrected by breeding and housing pups at 24oC until weaning. This phenotype is reminiscent of other mouse models with defective BAT activity (UCP1 and PACAP). In adulthood, when housed at 24oC, mice lacking Elovl6 have a normal energy balance phenotype, with no differences in energy expenditure or food intake. However, Elovl6 was upregulated by cold exposure. In order to investigate this phenotype more fully we cold exposed Elovl6 KO mice. Mice lacking elovl6 exhibited both elevated energy expenditure and food intake (hypermetabolism). The mechanism behind this hypermetabolism remains to be elucidated but it is notable that the Elovl6 mice at both 24oC and 4oC exhibit increased expression of thermogenic markers in subcutaneous white adipose tissue (the location of so called beige adipocytes or 'Brite' cells) and to a lesser extent in canonical brown fat. \n\n\n\nElovl6 KO mice have shorter chain fatty acids compared to WT mice. In WT mice, cold exposure leads to significant changes in fatty acid chain length in brown adipose, white adipose and liver tissue, but not in muscle. It is possible it is a direct regulatory event in which loss of Elovl6 results in an increased thermogenic response to cold via central mechanisms. However, a second possibility is that loss of Elovl6 has actually resulted in partially defective BAT. While this would seem paradoxical the UCP1 KO mouse exhibits elevated energy at sub thermoneutral temperatures, with the biggest discrepancy between WT and UCP1 KO mice being at 4oC - the lowest temperature studied. In mice, cold exposure has been demonstrated to dramatically increase levels of stearate in brown adipose tissue mitochondria, but not in muscle mitochondria, suggesting that altered mitochondrial function may contribute to the hypermetabolic phenotype. This aspect is currently under investigation. \n\n\n\nFinally, in addition to our specific investigations into the Elovl6 model we have carried out an extensive characterisation of adipose tissue lipid changes in various dietary and genetic models of obesity. So far, this has demonstrated that obesity and insulin resistance are associated with a lipid profile consistent with elevated SCD1 and Elovl6 activity, even after the composition of diets has been taken into account. This finding is consistent with the improved metabolic profiles of SCD1 (liver specific) and Elovl6 KO (whole organism) mouse models. Our research has potentially important implications for the functional food industry. In particular margarines and yoghurt drinks have been an area of intense focus of research and marketing by many of the major players in the FMCG world (Unilever's Flora Pro Active and Raiso group's Benecol are the leading brands in the UK with combined sales exceeding 50 million GBP). While these products have focused on cholesterol lowering, there remains a large area to exploit in the area of functional foods with modified lipid compositions and improved metabolic outcomes. Making functional food claims is increasingly difficult following EU regulations, requiring greater scientific evidence. By providing a scientific basis to support the roles of specific lipids in animal and fly models will allow a more rational and targeted design for the development of new lipid-modifying functional foods.\n\n\n\nWhether Elongase 6 is a valid target for pharmacological agents is at present difficult to assess. Whole organism ablation of Elovl6 in mice improves insulin sensitivity, but while the mechanism remains unclear it is difficult to assess the likelihood of its efficacy and safety in humans. \n The research funded by this grant will provide substantial benefit to the research community working in both metabolic science and lipid biology. By identifying unique roles for the products of Elovl6 in control of energy balance and brown adipose tissue function will enable a better understanding of the impact of modified diets and a deeper understanding of what lipid changes mean. \n\n\n\nAt present lipidomics is limited by a lack of functional information for many lipid species and on going work to improve this area of our understanding of metabolism is vital. The research related to the role of Elovl6 in regulating mitochondrial function will be invaluable to almost all areas of biology in which mitochondrial function is important. The alteration in fatty acid chain length in mouse models of obesity suggests a wider role of the elongases in the development of obesity related metabolic complications, this can potentially be targeted through dietary or pharmacological manipulation.
