{"id":"5B2EFB0C-B19A-4C59-BCE8-4F0FE12BFC95","title":"Wireless Video Transmission Based on Distributed Source Coding Principles","abstractText":"Due to its great practical potentials, distributed source coding (DSC) has recently become a very active research area. However, most obtained results have remained at the theoretical level. Thus, there is still a huge gap between research achievements and practical employment of DSC. Consequently, today's communication systems cannot exploit useful information about the topological structure or statistical dependence between signals in the network, and thus cannot realize significant performance gains promised by theory. The ultimate goal of the project is to bridge the gap between theory and practice, to solve key problems at the very heart of DSC, and in this way set the stage for its application in emerging systems and services. In particular, the project will focus on video transmission over wireless multiterminal networks and target at applications such as video surveillance networks, deep-space communications, and commercial real-time video multicast over heterogeneous wireless-wireline networks. Practical source-channel coding schemes will be designed based on DSC principles.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E021964/2","grantId":"EP/E021964/2","fundValue":"150025","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-02-28","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Vladimir  Stankovic","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Strathclyde","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
