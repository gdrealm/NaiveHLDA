{"id":"CF454728-5BCC-422B-95D2-85123E9BB3E3","title":"Enhancement of Electrochemical Energy Efficiency via Process Intensification","abstractText":"Improvement in energy efficiency and enhanced utilisation of renewable energy sources have long been recognised as the key steps needed to address current climate change concerns. This proposal tackles one important aspect of energy conversion, namely that involves the generation of chemical products using electrical power to supply the free energy of reaction required in an electrochemical cell. This is likely to become an increasingly important step in the exploitation and storage of energy from renewable-energy sources.The work will be concentrated on the construction and characterisation of a single rotating alkaline cell for water electrolysis. Electrolyte will be supplied to the inner radius of the cell from a stationary feed pipe via a rotating union through a hollow shaft. Current will be supplied via slip rings to the electrodes. The system will operate in a 'thermostatted' enclosure supplied with electrically heated air so that a range of operating temperatures can be covered. Two electrode designs will be tested, flat discs and sintered metal fibrous structure with and without catalytic activation.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F02715X/1","grantId":"EP/F02715X/1","fundValue":"220349","fundStart":"2007-09-01","fundEnd":"2009-02-28","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The research demonstrate the enormous benefit of using enhanced gravity field for electrolysis, especially for the production of hydrogen, It could reduce size of electrolyser by order of magnitude because of its high power density. It also provides a path way for energy storage (convert excess electric energy from wind turbines to hydrogen, which can be converted to electricity to meet demand when there is no wind) Energy Economic","person":"Hoi  Yeung","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Cranfield University","findingsText":" The research concluded that using acceleration field (enhance gravity) generated by rotation could not only improve the efficiency of electrolyer but also increase the power density by order of magnitude when compared with conventional electrolyser. When use for the electrolysis of water could be part of the system to store excess energy from renewable sources. The result demonstrated that enhanced gravity field can have significant benefits to gas liquid processes. What is needed is for companies develop field demonstrators.
