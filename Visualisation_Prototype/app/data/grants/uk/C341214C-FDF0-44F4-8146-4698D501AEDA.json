It can only be measured because of technological advance in the form of electronic trading. The data can only be analysed because of recent innovations in both software and supercomputing. The aggregate stock market index and the exchange rate are known to have a very low correlation with any other high-frequency macroeconomic variable. Order Flow has the potential to simultaneously provide explanatory power for equity and exchange rate returns for the first time. </p>\n\n<p>The twin objectives of the research will be to shed light on the applicability of this class of models to theory and data as well as to use them to enhance our understanding of the effects of monetary and exchange rate policy. The research should make a significant contribution to the international literature in our understanding of equity and exchange rate movements.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2177","grantId":"RES-000-22-2177","fundValue":"81236","fundStart":"2007-03-01","fundEnd":"2010-02-28","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  The main beneficiaries have been Central Banks.

The theory was capable of explaining the high volatility and persistence of real and nominal exchange rates as well as the high correlation between real and nominal rates.\n\nIn &quot;An information approach to international currencies&quot;, we developed a new theory of vehicle currencies. Models of currency competition focus on the 5% of trading attributable to balance-of-payments flows. We introduced an information approach that focuses on the other 95%. Important departures from traditional models arise when transactions convey information. First, prices reveal different information depending on whether trades are direct or though vehicle currencies. Second, missing markets arise due to insufficiently symmetric information, rather than insufficient transactions scale. Third, the indeterminacy of equilibrium that arises in traditional models is resolved: currency trade patterns no longer concentrate arbitrarily on market size. Empirically, we provided a first analysis of transactions across a full market triangle: the euro, yen and US dollar. The estimated transaction effects on prices support the information approach.\n\nIn &quot;International order flows: explaining equity and exchange rate returns&quot;, we modelled equity price and exchange rate behaviour based on a concept from microstructure-order flow. We obtained a theoretical relationship between equity returns, exchange rate returns and their relationship to home and foreign equity market order flow. To test the model we constructed daily aggregate order flow data from 800 million equity trades in the U.S. and France from 1999 to 2003. Almost 60% of the daily returns in the S&amp;P100 index are explained jointly by exchange rate returns and aggregate order flows in both markets. As predicted by the model, daily exchange rate returns and order flow into the French market have significant incremental explanatory power for the daily S&amp;P returns. The model implications were also validated for intraday returns.\n\nPlans for future research include the following:\nThe European sovereign bond market is the world's largest market for debt securities. With an outstanding aggregate value of approximately 4,395.9 billion Euros in 2006, it exceeds the size of the U.S. sovereign bond market with an aggregate value of roughly 4,413.5 billion Dollars (around 3 trillion Euros, at the moment). Transaction spreads are generally small in the interdealer market. However, do these favourable market conditions in the interdealer market also translate into favourable trading conditions in the customer segment of the bond market, in which smaller banks and other financial institutions request quotes from the primary dealers? As with many other markets, these wholesale customers do not have access to the interdealer trading platforms. Does dealer intermediation impose considerable costs for the clients? What determines the quality of customer quotes and their dispersion? These are very important and pressing policy concerns for European security regulators. The publications &quot;Transparency proposals for European sovereign bond markets&quot; as well as &quot;Benchmark status in fixed-income asset markets&quot; are relevant to the regulation of bond markets in Europe. These are pertinent because of the evolution of The Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID). The re-evaluation of financial regulation throughout Europe in the light of the banking collapse adds an additional urgency.
