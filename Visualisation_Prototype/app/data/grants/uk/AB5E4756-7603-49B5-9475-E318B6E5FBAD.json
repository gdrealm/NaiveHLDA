The interplay between cells effectively protects us from damage caused by environmental agents or genetic factors. However, tight control of these cellular interactions is necessary to allow for normal tissue development and growth as well as preventing normal tissues from being inadvertently attacked or invaded by aberrant cells. At one level, the system is regulated by a carefully directed programme of cell signalling that prevents undue movement of cells from their proper locations, or in the case of immune cells, carefully directed traffic of cells from tissues to lymph glands. In this project we wish to increase our understanding of the mechanisms that govern the ability of cells to move away from their normal position or to move between compartments of the body. This will provide us with important information that will help the design of therapies against the spread of cancer cells and autoimmune diseases as well as providing a better understanding of cell migration in tissue development and homeostasis.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0100152","grantId":"G0100152","fundValue":"571786","fundStart":"2002-09-01","fundEnd":"2008-05-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Gareth E  Jones","coPersons":["Ian Roger Hart","Clare  Isacke","Tony  Ng","John Alexander McGrath","Graham  Dunn"],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
