{"id":"BF1EA79C-3BEB-4924-89EC-BFCC6609EC63","title":"Genetic regulation of leaf development","abstractText":"Shoots are derived from a group of cells at the apex of the plant. These cells are organised into a defined structure called the shoot apical meristem. Cells in the centre of the meristem are undifferentiated and divide to give rise to daughter cells in the peripheral region of the meristem. Some of these peripheral region cells undergo many divisions and differentiate in the process of forming a leaf. The flattened simple leaf lamina of Arabidopsis and many other plants result from development along three axes. These are from tip-to-base, top-to-bottom and middle-to-edge. I am interested in genes that control these early events in leaf development. Mutations in the gene Asymmetric Leaves1 (AS1) in Arabidopsis result in changes in leaf development. as1 leaves are lobed compared with the simple leaf of wild type. Another set of genes further alters the as1 mutant leaf. These modifiers of as1 are called piggyback (PGY) genes. Mutations in PGY genes by themselves do not significantly affect leaf development. However, plants carrying both pgy and as1 mutations form leaf outgrowths on the top surface of the main plant leaf. The development of these extra leaves is similar to that of normal leaves. Therefore studying PGY genes will help us understand how normal leaves develop. Two PGY genes have been cloned and are related to proteins required for protein synthesis in other organisms such as yeast. Both PGY genes are also part of a small gene family in Arabidopsis. The research we are carrying out aims to determine how PGY genes affect leaf development and how PGY genes interact with other genes required for leaf development. The research also aims to determine the molecular function of PGY genes and whether PGY genes are required for protein synthesis.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D521730/1","grantId":"BB/D521730/1","fundValue":"193198","fundStart":"2006-05-02","fundEnd":"2009-05-01","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Mary  Byrne","coPersons":[],"organisation":"John Innes Centre","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
