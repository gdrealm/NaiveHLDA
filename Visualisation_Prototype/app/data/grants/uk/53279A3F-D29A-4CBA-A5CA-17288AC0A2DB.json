{"id":"53279A3F-D29A-4CBA-A5CA-17288AC0A2DB","title":"Reading the unreadable with metamaterials","abstractText":"The aim of the proposal is the development of a high throughput, broadband method to access real-time information about the fine details of physical and biological objects. This will be achieved by transforming evanescent electromagnetic waves, the information carriers for small scale features, to free-space propagating waves that can be collected easily by standard optical techniques. The suggested metamaterial platform will impact most fields where fine-scale diagnostics are important (materials science, condensed matter physics, biology) and will also allow the recording and retrieval of encrypted information for which specially designed metamaterials will act as a unique decryption key.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M008797/1","grantId":"EP/M008797/1","fundValue":"97027","fundStart":"2014-10-21","fundEnd":"2016-10-20","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"NIKITAS  PAPASIMAKIS","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
