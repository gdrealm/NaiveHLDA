Proteomic studies are performed in laboratories all over the world, investigating disease processes, as well as the basic function of cells in humans, animals, plants and microorganisms. Proteins are challenging molecules to work with but the technology of mass spectrometry (MS) has developed over many years, such that it is now possible to identify and quantify many hundreds, or even thousands, of proteins simultaneously in one type of sample compared with another, for example to test how a cell responds during a disease process compared to a healthy cell, allowing us to begin understanding the complex and dynamic molecular changes. \n \nMS can produce very large raw data sets, running to many Gigabytes for a single sample analysed. The raw files are processed, often in two stages by different software packages that first identify and then quantify the proteins that were analysed by the instrument. In the past, the raw data files were encoded in a data format specific to each instrument vendor, effectively tying scientists to using the software provided with the instrument, which have not always been the optimal solutions for analysing the data. A global consortium of academics and industrial researchers, called the Proteomics Standards Initiative (PSI), has collaborated to agree open access standards for storing raw data, protein identification data and quantitative data. These standards mean that open-source (and free) software can now be developed, capable of analysing data arising from any type of instrument. It also means that data sets generated at high cost can be deposited in a public repository, such as the PRIDE database, hosted at the European Bioinformatics Institute, allowing their re-use for integration and interpretation of data from other studies, improving our knowledge about genomes and biological systems, and improving software tools in this field. \n \nIn this project, we are requesting support so that the PSI standard data formats can continue to be maintained and evolve as new proteomics techniques are described in the literature. We are also developing interfaces so that other groups can develop new software packages easily, using the PSI standards as inputs and outputs. The standards are being used as part of a recently released raw data archive within PRIDE, which will store very large amounts of data for the entire scientific community. As such, we are working on software to make it straightforward for research labs to deposit and visualise data in PRIDE, as well as optimising the way in which data is compressed and stored, so that the system can scale for the needs of the next generation of instruments. These developments of PSI standards, software and PRIDE are essential for making sure that proteomics data are open access for all researchers and not restricted to the small number of laboratories with specialised, expensive software.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/K01997X/1","grantId":"BB/K01997X/1","fundValue":"279890","fundStart":"2013-11-01","fundEnd":"2016-10-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Andrew Robert Jones","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
