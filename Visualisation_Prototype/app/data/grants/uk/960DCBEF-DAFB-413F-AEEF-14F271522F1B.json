{"id":"960DCBEF-DAFB-413F-AEEF-14F271522F1B","title":"Temperature-driven premature ageing of cellular populations in energy-storing tendons: the gap junction connection.","abstractText":"Athletes who participate in running and jumping have a similar problem to their equine counterparts on the racetrack. Both frequently injure large tendons in their legs that function as 'biological springs' to save muscular effort by stretching and storing energy when the leg bears weight, then rebounding to propel the athlete forward. In people the Achilles tendon (AT) has this function, while in horses it is the superficial digital flexor tendon (SDFT). As more people participate in sports to improve their health and maintain mobility during ageing, more AT injuries are occurring. In Scotland the incidence has increased by 90% over the last 15 years, now comprising &gt;10% of soft tissue injuries. Up to 30% of racehorses suffer similar problems. Tendons heal slowly with scar tissue and never regain their original strength. Such injuries interrupted the international careers of David Beckham and Kelly Holmes, and those of many well-known racehorses including Kicking King, the 2005 Cheltenham Cup winner. Tendon injuries follow an undefined period of accumulation of painless damage to their substance (matrix) during exercise. Tendon cells, called tenocytes, do not repair this 'microdamage' and may be killed, begin to produce the wrong type of collagen, and/or degrade the surrounding matrix, causing a vicious injury cycle. Research over many years has suggested that this degeneration represents acceleration of a normally age-related process. Slowing or preventing this would have a greater impact on preventing injuries, and so improving performance and welfare of athletes than attempting treatment. We think a major factor causing tenocyte injury is high temperature. As tendons stretch and contract, some stored energy is lost as heat that cannot be easily dissipated. The SDFT core reaches at least 45oC during galloping, from its normal temperature of 37-38oC. As the AT functions in a similar way, hyperthermia is also highly likely to occur in its core. In the laboratory, most tenocytes die after 10 min at 45oC, but interestingly this involves transmission of 'death signals' between cells through gap junctions (GJ). GJ are small pores directly connecting neighbouring cells into networks. When GJ are chemically blocked following heating much of the tenocyte death and upregulation of less effective matrix proteins can be prevented. This is exciting, as GJ can be manipulated. We will use cells and tissue from SDFTs to determine when, relative to heating, the tenocytes 'decide' to die or alter their activity. We will measure an array of biomarkers to identify points at which we might reverse these changes e.g. do we need to do something within minutes or hours? Secondly we will explore a drug-free method of intervention: cooling of tendons after exercise e.g. using ice baths is often used as an 'injury prevention' measure. Cooling can close GJ in other cell types, which could prevent spread of death signals during critical post-exercise periods. Mild hypothermia (i.e. 32oC) may also upregulate 'cold-stress proteins' that protect cells. We aim to understand when, for how long, at what levels and how many times temperature differentials should be applied by athletes to reduce tendon microdamage. In the final part of this project we will look at one of the major proteins making up the GJ, called connexin 43 (Cx43). We will investigate methods of targeting the Cx43 molecule i.e. preventing it from being made within tenocytes. This will allow us to better understand how GJ influence cell death/damage following heat shock, but may also facilitate development of drugs to regulate it that could be delivered locally e.g. in gels or ointments. With the upcoming London Olympic Games and Glasgow Commonwealth Games and the likelihood that increasing numbers of people will be inspired to participate in athletic activity, this is a timely opportunity to develop methods of preventing injuries while also improving the welfare of horses.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/J000663/1","grantId":"BB/J000663/1","fundValue":"147555","fundStart":"2012-02-07","fundEnd":"2015-05-04","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The work is ongoing and no impacts can be report at this time.  ","person":"Jayesh  Dudhia","coPersons":["Roger Kenneth Smith"],"organisation":"Royal Veterinary College","findingsText":" Tendons during exercise can heat up by several degrees above normal body temperature and it is possible that this heat build-up could cause damage to the tendon, eventually leading to tendinitis. As it is difficult to measure the actual changes in the tissue in live animals we have developed a method that uses pieces of tendon tissue (obtained from waste material from post-mortem rooms or abattoir. This allows us to measure the changes that occur in tendon cells due to high temperatures. We have discovered that soon (within 4-6 hours) after exposure to high temperature many cells enter a pathway towards their death, however other cells are able to resist this effect by inducing a family of proteins that help cells to overcome different types of stress, including heat. We have also discovered that the affected cells can communicate with adjacent cells and appear to transmit so-called &amp;amp;quot;death signals&amp;amp;quot;. We believe this spreading of the death message causes more cells to perish. This provides a potential target for therapeutic or preventative purposes for tendon injuries, for example by blocking the death signal route by specific drugs or by cooling the tendon after exercise. However, as cooling might also cause damage to the tendon cells, the optimal cooling temperature requires further investigation. The findings so far has led us to investigate drugs that block cell-to-cell communications (via GAP junctions) and by rapid cooling of the tendon to a specific temperature after hyperthermia. This may act to block the spread of death signals between cells. Thiis work would provide a preventative measure for tendon injures and is on-going.
