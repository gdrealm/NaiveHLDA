There is very limited cross-species transfer of infections suggesting that individual S. aureus clones have evolved the mechanisms required to infect a single host only. The purpose of this project is to identify what factors are produced by S. aureus which contribute to pathogenesis of specific animal hosts. In addition, the evolution of S. aureus clones infecting different animal species will be explored. The work will be carried out using whole-genome microarrays. Microarrays consist of glass slides which can represent each of the genes identified in the whole genome of that organism. The microarray allows the comparison of the genome content of many bacterial isolates. We will then determine if the genes are being expressed during animal infection by measuring the antibody response to specific factors. This would indicate that the proteins are involved in host-pathogen interactions and may play a role in causing disease. Taken together, this study will provide new insights into S. aureus evolution and pathogenesis and will identify new targets for vaccine or therapeutic development.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D521222/1","grantId":"BB/D521222/1","fundValue":"232794","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2008-12-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Ross  Fitzgerald","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":" A final report for this grant was submitted in 2009.\nMain discoveries:\nIdentification of numerous novel mobile genetic elements including plasmids, bacteriophages and pathogenicity islands which are widely distributed among animal strains of S. aureus and which encode novel putative virulence factors with host-specific activities. \n\nTracing the evolutionary history of 2 major animal-specific strains of S. aureus including the identification of a recent host jump between humans and poultry and the genetic events which have contributed to poultry and ovine host adaptation.\n\nThe identification of a virulent bovine clone of S. aureus with very high levels of cytolytic toxin expression which causes severe acute mastitis and which has the potential to acquire antibiotic resistance and to be a threat to public health Our research has pioneered an expansion of research in the area of Staphylococcus aureus host adaptation and host-switching.
