The condition can be characterised by devastating seizures, which severely affects a person's quality of life. Epilepsy frequently affects a patient's cognitive and mental health, and the disorder contributes to elevated propensity for depression and suicide compared to the general population. These effects are most serious in patients who have intractable epilepsy (i.e. people who continue to suffer from seizures despite antiepileptic drug treatment). Intractable epilepsy constitutes 30% of all patients with epilepsy, but accounts for 75% of the immense health care costs of the disorder. \n\nIf certain criteria are met, many patients with intractable focal epilepsy (where epileptic seizures originate from one region of the brain) may be offered neurosurgery with the goal of removing the part of the brain causing epileptic seizures. This procedure may substantially improve a patient's quality life - and potentially save it. In patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), which is the most common type of intractable focal epilepsy, neurosurgery will completely stop debilitating seizures after one year of the operation in 70% of patients. This figure reduces as time goes on, and can be as low as 40% 10 years after surgery. Furthermore, surgery may reduce the frequency and severity of seizures, but not eliminate them. It is unknown why one patient seemingly suitable for neurosurgery will have a poor postsurgical outcome and another will have a successful outcome. Undergoing neurosurgery in an attempt to stop epileptic seizures is likely to be the most important decision a patient will make in their lifetime. It is therefore extremely important to have reliable information before surgery that will inform the patient and their doctors of the likelihood of seizure control after surgery so that patient and doctor can make an informed decision on whether to pursue neurosurgery and weigh the potential benefits against risks.\n\nIt is the goal of the proposed research to understand the reasons for why some patients deemed suitable for neurosurgery continue to have disabling postsurgical seizures, and to identify the aspects of brain structure and brain impairment that predict whether a patient will respond favourably or unfavourably to surgery (i.e. the development of 'prognostic markers'). A structural brain abnormality suggests that this part of the brain may be causing the seizures. Identifying such an abnormality using MRI scanning will offer reasonable confidence that the surgical removal of the abnormality will stop the seizures from starting. However, the MRI scans routinely acquired during clinical practice in hospitals may not detect subtle brain abnormalities that support epileptic seizures. The brain scanning methods used in this proposal are state-of-the-art and are extremely sensitive to very subtle alterations in normal brain structure, which may support the start and/or spread of epileptic seizures throughout the brain. It is anticipated that the suite of sophisticated analysis tools applied to the high quality brain imaging data obtained before surgery will build a detailed picture for why some patients continue to have seizures after surgery, and that this information can be used to predict whether a patient is likely or unlikely to be surgically rendered seizure free. \n\nThis research will have substantial scientific and clinical impact, with a fundamental aim to improve human health and quality of life. \nResearch objectives will be delivered in the short-to-medium term (3 years).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/K023152/1","grantId":"MR/K023152/1","fundValue":"294139","fundStart":"2013-09-01","fundEnd":"2016-08-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Simon Sean Keller","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
