Biofilms are described as a 'city of microbes' in which bacteria are hold together into a solid matrix. There is compelling evidence that the biofilm lifestyle is an efficient means for microorganisms to maintain a protected niche. Establishment of biofilms in humans leads to chronic infection that can persist for life and lead to host death. It is well described that stability and resilience of biofilms is a major medical and industrial problem. Biofilms have been shown to display resistance to antibiotic treatments and are recalcitrant to eradication via the immune system. The formation of the biofilm obeys to a series of events that start with initial attachment of the bacterium on the host tissue. The initial attachment requires bacterial surface adhesins that are frequently associated with long fibres called fimbriae. In the course of the infection process, the bacteria should adapt and either form a biofilm to persist or colonize the host more aggressively. For bacteria, these choices are based in large part on local environmental cues, and are effected through altered gene expression. For example whether the bacteria decide to stop motility and start attachment may result in the assembly of these long fibres-containing adhesins. In order to detect the environmental cues bacteria have evolved regulatory devices that are made of two-components, one for signal detection and one for affecting gene expression, both components, called sensor and response regulator being intimately linked. The opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a prototype of free-living organism with the capacity to cause disease in a wide range of eukaryotic hosts. P. aeruginosa is responsible for some of the most serious infections in humans, including emerging nosocomial infections associated with impairment of host defences. It is responsible for severe lung and upper respiratory tract infections in patients with Cystic Fibrosis and acute pneumopathies. P. aeruginosa is equipped with numerous genes responsible for the assembly of the above-mentioned fimbriae (cup genes). Moreover, this bacterium has a wide repertoire of two-component systems that give this organism an ubiquitous and versatile character. Finally, P. aeruginosa displays a remarkable range of virulence, from weakly virulent isolates to highly virulent broad-spectrum strains. In the present study we will investigate the role of a two-component regulatory system (Rcs/Pvr) on expression of cupD fimbrial genes. We have chosen to study those genes, because they are located on the pathogenicity island of the highly virulent P. aeruginosa PA14 strain. These genes are otherwise not found in the genome of the laboratory strain P. aeruginosa PAO1. Pathogenicity islands are of mobile genetic elements, which play a pivotal role in the virulence of bacterial pathogens of humans, animals and plants. Our study will bring original, detailed and integrated molecular basis about a complex network of regulation, the Pvr/Rcs system, and the specific cupD gene target. The characterization of the role of these systems in biofilm and virulence will improve our basic knowledge of signalling and fimbriae assembly in P. aeruginosa and will provide molecular details for the search of lead molecules interfering with P. aeruginosa pathogenesis.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F019645/1","grantId":"BB/F019645/1","fundValue":"348657","fundStart":"2008-11-02","fundEnd":"2011-11-01","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Our findings have been published in high quality peer-reviewed journals and contributed to the advance in knowledge in this research field.

Demonstration that the PA14 Pseudomonas aeruginosa RcsB and PvrR response regulators antagonistically control fimbrial cupD genes (published in Mikkelsen et al., PLoS One, 2009).\n\n\n\n2. Unexpected organisation of the Rcs/Pvr pathway. The PvrS sensor activates the RcsB regulator using RcsC as a phosphorelay. The rcs/pvr and cupD genes are located on a pathogenicity island. The RcsB regulon was tested using microarrays showing that cupD are not the only genes controlled. We identified three regulatory genes on the core genome that are up-regulated by RcsB and which possesses a RcsB binding site (Mikkelsen et al., Mol Microbiol. In preparation).\n\n\n\n3. The Roc system homologous to the Rcs/Pvr system is located on the core genome. In the Pseudomonas PAK strain we showed that Roc, not only impact cupC gene expression and biofilm formation, but also impacts efflux pump expression and antibiotic resistance (published in Sivaneson, Mikkelsen et al., Mol. Microbiol., 2011). Drug targets for pharmaceutical companies. Understanding the regulatory networks associated with bacterial biofilm and chronic infections is one way to develop new drugs interfering and subverting the bacterial infection strategy and to provide new therapeutic routes.
