Current practice is still biased towards measuring static and single dimensions of child poverty, primarily using monetary indicators as a proxy to capture other areas of deprivation. Cross-sectional research shows that assumptions about the extent to which poverty measures can serve as proxies for each other are often incorrect. As a result, policy is designed and targeted on the basis of incomplete information, leading to deficient identification of vulnerable children and an inadequate response to their needs.<br /><br />This research responds to these concerns by using monetary and non-monetary measures to analyse child poverty dynamics, assessing overlaps and mismatches between those measures and investigating reasons for potential differences using a combination of primary qualitative data and secondary panel survey data. It covers two case study countries, Ethiopia and Vietnam, and aims to influence academics, policy-makers and practitioners in developing and developed countries to contribute positively to the reduction of child poverty. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K001833/1","grantId":"ES/K001833/1","fundValue":"173972","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Keetie Catharina Huberdina  Roelen-Rienties","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Institute of Development Studies","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
