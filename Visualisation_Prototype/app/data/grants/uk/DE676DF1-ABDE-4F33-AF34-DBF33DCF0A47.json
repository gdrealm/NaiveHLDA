{"id":"DE676DF1-ABDE-4F33-AF34-DBF33DCF0A47","title":"Transcription factories: micro-architecture and specialization","abstractText":"Only some of the genetic information encoded in DNA is copied into RNA and translated into protein; copying is selective, and mis-copying results in disease (e.g., cancer). We wish to analyze the mechanisms that enable the copying machines ? RNA polymerases ? to act selectively. During the last few decades, controls at the local level have been scrutinized in detail; however, little is know about those acting globally and it is these that we will study.\nWe have developed a way of localizing newly-made RNA copies. Small holes are made in the cell membrane using a weak detergent, and the cells are allowed to make new RNA copies in the presence of tagged building blocks. These building blocks are incorporated into the new copies. Then, fluorescent (or gold) probes are bound to the tags so the copies can be localized using a light (or electron) microscope. As structure is preserved, the copies can be mapped relative to the various features in the nucleus. It turns out that many genes come together to form hot spots of copying activity. We plan to analyze the detailed micro-architecture of these hot spots, the way their numbers and shape change as cells differentiate and divide, and what determines which genes associate with which hot spots. We hope that these studies will lead to a better understanding of the basic mechanisms controlling copying, and of the errors that occur during mis-copying.\nResults will be disseminate to the general public in various ways. My web site (http://www.path.ox.ac.uk/prc) contains various pages specifically for the lay reader (two contain movies). I have also written an undergraduate textbook, and many of the web pages support this book. To my surprise, these pages have a wide readership ? presumably because they provide links to a range of general resources (e.g., how to use ?Word?, build a web site, write concisely, access on-line grammars). I also give interviews and talks when asked (e.g., on local radio, to the Women?s Institute). Results will also be disseminated to the Health Service, Industry, and scientific community through talks given at scientific conferences, and through publication in peer-reviewed articles/reviews. If results of commercial value are unexpectedly obtained, we will exploit them through Isis Innovation (the technology transfer company of Oxford University) as we have done in the past. [Isis hold two of our patents, and have licensed our monoclonal antibodies.]","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0400628","grantId":"G0400628","fundValue":"1067200","fundStart":"2005-04-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter  Cook","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
