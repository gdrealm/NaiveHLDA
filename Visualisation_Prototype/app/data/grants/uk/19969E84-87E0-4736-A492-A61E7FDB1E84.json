This multidisciplinary proposal unites leading engineers and scientists from the Universities of Heriot-Watt, Aston, Oxford and University of Edinburgh to realise our vision of production of low carbon jet fuels through the integration of novel technologies for co-valorisation of carbon dioxide (CO2) and biomass. Our project aims to produce low carbon synthetic aviation jet fuel using renewable energy from waste agricultural and forestry biomass and captured CO2. An integrated chemistry (bottom-up method to develop novel catalysts and electrodes) and engineering (top-down method to tailor heat and mass transport parameters influencing reaction conditions) approach will be implemented towards high selective and efficient jet fuel production. Process integration and life cycle analysis will be performed by incorporating the newly developed process into a greater domain (e.g. various options of carbon sources), and to investigate the social/political/economic valuation of the biomass and CO2 to jet fuel value added chain.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/N009924/1","grantId":"EP/N009924/1","fundValue":"1800520","fundStart":"2016-01-01","fundEnd":"2019-12-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"M Mercedes Maroto-Valer","coPersons":["John  Andresen","Bing  Xu","Maja Izabela Piecyk","Philip Keith Greening","Daniel Graham Wright","Peter  Edwards","Jin  Xuan","Huizhi  Wang","Jamal  Ouenniche","Adam Fraser Lee","Jim  Scott"],"organisation":"Heriot-Watt University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
