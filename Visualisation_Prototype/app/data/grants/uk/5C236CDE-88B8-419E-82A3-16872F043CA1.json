Thus the input from the eyes is relayed via a structure called the visual thalamus to the visual cortex, but the visual cortex sends feedback connections back down to the visual thalamus. Indeed numerically these exceed those arising from the eyes. Why does this happen? What do these connections do? They seem to bring the knowledge from the processing at higher levels in the brain back to earlier levels and in some way use this to enhance our ability to perceive the world around us. Here we are probing the role of the higher cortical area concerned with processing motion in the visual world and the way this area is linked into a functional circuit with the primary visual cortex and thalamus. The suggestion is that the feed forward and feedback connections linking three levels in the visual system operate as an integrated whole rather than as separate steps in a sequence.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0701535","grantId":"G0701535","fundValue":"1499960","fundStart":"2008-09-01","fundEnd":"2013-02-28","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Adam Murdin Sillito","coPersons":["Thomas  Salt"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
