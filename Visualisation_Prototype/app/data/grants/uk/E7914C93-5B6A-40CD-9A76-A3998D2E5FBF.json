The range of functional polymeric architectures synthesised in Perrier's group has developed to such extent that specific SEC systems are required for analyses. The use of RAPRA for such a routine work would be extremely time consuming and very expensive. The SEC systems will help Dr Perrier to develop further his research group, and will allow PhD students to have hand-on experience on this very important type of analyses. In addition, the co-Investigators will have full access to the equipment in order to rapidly analyse samples of interest to their research.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D059569/1","grantId":"EP/D059569/1","fundValue":"110902","fundStart":"2006-08-01","fundEnd":"2009-07-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Xiao-Song  Wang","coPersons":["James  Guthrie"],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
