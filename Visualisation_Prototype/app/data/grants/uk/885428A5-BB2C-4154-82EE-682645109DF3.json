The project aimed to fill this gap by providing a better understanding of the conditions under which such personnel work in the television, recording and magazine publishing industries, across various genres. \nThe three industries were chosen because, according to one influential account of the cultural industries, each has distinctive conditions and dynamics, typical of a wider sub-set of cultural industries. So the project also aimed to enhance understanding of how different cultural industries operate.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=112075/1","grantId":"112075/1","fundValue":"98088","fundStart":"2006-01-15","fundEnd":"2007-04-15","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"David  Hesmondhalgh","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Open University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
