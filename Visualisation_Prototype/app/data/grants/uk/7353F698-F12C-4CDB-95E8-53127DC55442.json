This project evaluates a selection of experimental software tools to discover whether they offer valuable unconventional opportunities to connect researchers across widely-differing disciplines and to examine how they might support innovative collaborations, such as shared bibliographical resources. The study will focus on the study of narrative within a digital context but findings are expected to be of use to a wide range of researchers.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=119187/1","grantId":"119187/1","fundValue":"47009","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2007-09-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Sue  Thomas","coPersons":["Simon  Mills"],"organisation":"De Montfort University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
