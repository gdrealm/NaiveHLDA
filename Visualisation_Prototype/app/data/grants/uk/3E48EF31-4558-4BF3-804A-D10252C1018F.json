Significant achievements include:\n- Engagement with local researchers, UN organisations and NGOs in Feb 2013 to start to understand the decision-making context and identify an appropriate entry point into the disaster risk reduction system in Kazakhstan\n- Developing a collaborative relationship with the scientists at the Institute of Seismology in Kazakhstan and a joint research plan, which we are making good progress on. A seismologist from IS made a two week visit to BGS in April 2014 to develop a joint work plan. This has a range of hazard assessment-related research objectives. So far, the work the BGS-IS team have done together has led to a report on the selection of ground motion prediction equations for use in the Tien Shan (and is being prepared for publication) and the second phase of work (determining a regional attenuation model for the Tien Shan region of Kazakhstan) has just started. \n- The BGS team delivered training in SeisAn seismic analysis software to staff from the Institute of Seismology and the national seismic monitoring agency of Kazakhstan in September 2014.\n- S Sargeant has been made a Research Associate at the Overseas Development Institute, which builds on the Earthquakes without Frontiers collaboration (September 2014) At the moment, our aim is for our collaboration with the Institute of Seismology to lead to research findings that can be integrated into the seismic hazard assessment that will underpin the new Kazakhstan building code for earthquakes Communities and Social Services/Policy,Construction,Government, Democracy and Justice,Other","dataset":"gtr"}
