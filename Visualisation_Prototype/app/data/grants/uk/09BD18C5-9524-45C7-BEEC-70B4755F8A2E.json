The intervening years have demonstrated that the medium of magnetic audio-tape is time-sensitive in its fragility. The material in its analogue form currently resides in the Wessex Film and Sound Archive at the Hampshire Record Office, and represents a style and structure of commercial broadcasting now gone forever. Additionally, it chronicles significant social events within its region, making it of intrinsic historical value to both local and national scholars and broadcasters.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/D001641/1","grantId":"AH/D001641/1","fundValue":"89502","fundStart":"2007-01-08","fundEnd":"2008-07-07","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Sean  Street","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Bournemouth University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
