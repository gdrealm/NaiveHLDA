{"id":"E327EB52-54E7-414B-99BD-101B4F21C841","title":"Gamma-herpesvirus dissemination in vivo","abstractText":"The gamma-herpesviruses are a major cause of disease. This reflects the capacity of viral gene expression to evade the host defence mechanisms encoded by the human genome. While there has been enormous investment in the analysis of both host and pathogen DNA sequences, we have very little idea how the relevant proteins interact in vivo. With the gamma-herpesviruses, this reflects a relative lack of suitable experimental models with which to analyze host / pathogen interactions. We are using the MHV-68 model to address, in an important class of complex parasites, this deficit in our understanding of immune gene function .\nOur research findings are communicated principally in specialist journals. We regularly present unpublished data at scientific meetings. Information is communicated directly to the public at university open days, departmental seminars and via the departmental and divisional web sites.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0400427","grantId":"G0400427","fundValue":"244006","fundStart":"2005-05-01","fundEnd":"2008-04-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Philip  Stevenson","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
