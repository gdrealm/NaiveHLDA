However, the recent Stanford University whole engine simulation, acknowledges that strong component interactions can take place, and that to advance understanding these interactions must be accounted for. This is strong motivation for connecting Savill and Peake's recent EPSRC computational modelling work on the fan and outlet guide vanes to Tucker's recent EPSRC funded simulation work on the jet, through the fan bypass flow. Once connected, we then wish to extend further downstream, ultimately exploring the interaction of the nacelle shear layer and jet with the deployed wing flap of the airframe. The key objective for computer models is to predict engine-airframe-pylon interactions. Here, moving in this direction, we wish to perform ambitious large eddy simulation and analytical studies to predict the fan, outlet guide vane, pylon interaction along with other bypass duct component interactions (a real bypass duct is not a clean geometry with multiple gas path blockages). We then wish to feed this information into the jet nozzle, exploring the scattering of the upstream sound by the jet pipes and the interaction of this with the downstream airframe. The physical insights and models gained should lay foundations for quieter more environmentally friendly aircraft. Notably, the study will endeavour to exploit the traditional triad of measurement, analytical analysis and computation. However, the former will be based on existing data.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I01022X/1","grantId":"EP/I01022X/1","fundValue":"204378","fundStart":"2011-07-12","fundEnd":"2015-01-11","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  To inform Rolls-Royce plc &amp;amp; Airbus Operations Ltd.\nTo complement work of the High Performance Computing Consortium on Computational Aeroacoustics and inform new UK Applied Aerodynamics Consortium.

In particular the computer simulations have been shown to capture the various known, and newly identified, noise sources and new mathematical modelling descriptions developed for these. The work allows a better understanding of the overall noise generation mechanisms for latest generation very large by-pass ratio aeroengines, and so can help facilitate the introduction of control techniques required to meet 2020 noise emission targets.\nIt shows that such high-fidelity computational aeroacoustics analysis can now been performed for whole engine configurations and so help minimise propulsion system integration penalties for aircraft operations.\nFor the future such methods can now be used with some confidence to develop novel aircraft/engine configurations and technologies that will be needed to meet more stringent 2050 emissions targets.
