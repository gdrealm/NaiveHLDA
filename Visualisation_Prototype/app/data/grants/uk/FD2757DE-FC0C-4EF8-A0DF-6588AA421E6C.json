One way to tackle this problem is theuse of logic.Let us first take a brief look at logic. We can use logic to (1) make statements about the world, (2) define when a statement holds or does not hold in the world, (3) deduce new statements from given ones using rules of reasoning.`World' can mean the world we live in and logic was originally indeeddeveloped to reason about everyday problems. In mathematics, the worldone reasons about is the world of mathematical objects. Themathematical world is rich enough to model different notions ofcomputation. Mathematical logic thus allows us to devise differentlogics for different models of computation. The logics relevant forthis proposal are known as modal logics.The upshot of this effort should be to make reasoning aboutcomputations completely precise and thus to eliminate the errorshumans tend to make when reasoning about programs.II.In my project I will look at particular models of computation whichare called transition systems. Transition systems consist of statesand relations between states. The idea is that each state representsa given moment of the computation and the relations describe how thecomputation proceeds from on state to another.The project aims at a general theory of logics for transitionsystems. It will establish the relationship between logics andtransition systems via the following detour that allows us to use acertain mathematical theory known as Stone duality. Recent developments suggest using co-algebras to represent transitionsystems. Coalgebras are in a special relationship---calledduality---to algebras. In a similar way as known from solvingequations in school, algebra can be used to formulate reasoningprinciples.In particular, the aims of this proposal are the following. Toassociate to any type of transition system an appropriate logic. Toshow how these logics can be applied to the verification of statementsabout programs. To investigate how certain concepts and tools ofmathematical logic can be adapted to coalgebras and their logics.III.The project will contribute to the theory of coalgebras as a generaltheory of transition systems as developed in the 1990s by manyresearchers. It will also be an important contribution to the recentworks on the connections between (modal) logic andcoalgebras. Coalgebras and modal logic have received attention fromresearchers in different areas of mathematics and computer science andthis research will bring to light new connections them.In a wider context, the project concerns the fundamental relationshipunderlying models of computation on the one hand and logic on theother hand. The development of the theory of coalgebras opens up thepossibility of integrating existing insights and to explore newdirections.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/C014014/1","grantId":"EP/C014014/1","fundValue":"118516","fundStart":"2006-02-01","fundEnd":"2008-05-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The grant is in the mathematical foundations of computer science and my findings have been used exclusively in academia. \n\nThe work had immediate impact on a number of PhD thesis such as Dahlqvist (Imperial College London, 2014), Wilkinson (Southampton, 2013), Myers (Imperial College London, 2011), Leal (Amsterdam, 2011), Kissig (Leicester, 2012), Petrisan (Leicester, 2011).\n\nImpact on the wider society will be indirect and may take a couple of decades.  ","person":"Alexander  Kurz","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Leicester","findingsText":" The aim of the grant was to investigate the mathematical foundations of systems specification via the duality of algebra and coalgebra in general and via Stone duality in particular. \n\nThis aim has been fully met and the foundations of a beautiful general theory of systems specifications has been developed.\n\nOne of the main mathematical results of the grant is that all sifted colimit preserving functors on a variety have a presentation by operation and equations. This provides a bridge between, on the one hand, the abstract category theoretic treatment of logics for coalgebras and, on the other hand, the concrete logics that allow us to specify and verify, for example, dynamic systems or security protocols. \n\nThe basic theory has been layed out in (Kurz, Rosicky, 2012), which was written and circulated in Summer 2006 and was applied in substantial papers such as (Bonsangue, Kurz 2007) and (Kupke, Kurz, Venema 2008/2012). The grant investigates foundations of computation and therefore has potential impact on any area that uses computing devices. Of course, this impact will be indirect and may be 20 or more years down the line. So you will understand that I hesitated to tick either no box at all or all of them. Given the current pressure put on researchers to show impact, I decided to make clear that I firmly believe that my foundational research will have impact.
