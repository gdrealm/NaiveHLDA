{"id":"AFAE0C53-D86A-4C02-B642-20D44CDAA895","title":"Developing a molecular level understanding of photodynamic therapy using femtosecond pump-probe spectroscopy","abstractText":"Photodynamic therapy (PDT) uses light-activated drugs to treat diseases ranging from cancer to age-related macular degeneration and bacterial infections. It is based on the concept that a non-toxic chemical, referred to as a photosensitiser, is localised preferentially in the target site and is then activated by light, usually delivered by fibre-optics, so that there is minimal damage to surrounding healthy tissue. The absorption of light triggers a sequence of photophysical and photochemical processes that generate reactive oxygen species which destroy cancer cells, neovasculature or bacteria.\n\nThe choice of photosensitiser, the drug-light time interval, drug dose and light flux can be treated as adjustable parameters, to be optimised for a particular PDT. The objective of this proposal is to develop a detailed understanding of the fundamental photophysics, photochemistry and photobiology of PDT at the molecular level. Such understanding is essential if we are to develop the capability to design efficient photosensitisers for specific treatments from first principles.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0902229","grantId":"G0902229","fundValue":"84549","fundStart":"2011-06-01","fundEnd":"2012-05-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Helen  Fielding","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
