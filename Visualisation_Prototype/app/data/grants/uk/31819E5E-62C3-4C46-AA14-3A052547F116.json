{"id":"31819E5E-62C3-4C46-AA14-3A052547F116","title":"Vital Politics/Valuing Life","abstractText":"<p>Human life has its limits in birth and death. Kant saw that “Life is the faculty a being has of acting according to the laws of the faculty of desire”. Life, then, is of limited capacity. But so too is life conceived of as potential. It can be developed, realised, squandered, used up, cultivated or lost. The aim of this seminar series is to explore this two-fold sense of life: as limit and as capacity. We want to suggest that in both regards life is subject to cultural, political, economic and technological determinants that mean that the question ‘what is life?’ must ever have a series of geographical answers. Examining these ‘vital geographies’ provides a way to focus some of the most interesting current work in geography and cognate disciplines on substantive issues regarding human health and wellbeing. Among the issues this seminar series will explore, for example, is the political economy of pharmaceuticals, the social ecology of disease, histories of mental health and the biopolitics of medicine. In every case, the aim is to forge an inter-disciplinary dialogue capable of understanding contemporary life as both an ethical and an empirical problem.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-451-25-4337","grantId":"RES-451-25-4337","fundValue":"6098","fundStart":"2007-02-01","fundEnd":"2008-05-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Simon Morrison Reid-Henry","coPersons":["Gerry  Kearns"],"organisation":"Queen Mary, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
