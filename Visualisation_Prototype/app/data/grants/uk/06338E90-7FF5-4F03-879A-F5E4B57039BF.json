This makes the theory more exciting and adds value to the project. If we take a closed wire and dip it in and out of soapy water, the soap film that forms across the hoop is in fact a minimal (constant mean curvature equal to zero) surface, and the physical properties of soap films were already studied by Plateau in the 1850s. Among all surfaces spanning a given boundary, a soap film is the one with least area. While the air pressure on the sides of a soap film is equal and constant, if we change the pressure on one side, for instance by blowing air on it, the new surface that we obtain is a soap bubble. Mathematically, soap bubbles are constant mean curvature surfaces, and they minimize area under a volume constraint.\n\nThis project aims to describe several geometric properties of minimal and constant mean curvature surfaces. Roughly speaking, I intend to prove that constant mean curvature surfaces which satisfy certain weak geometric conditions cannot bend too much. I intend to construct examples to show that the previous results are, in a sense, sharp. Finally, I intend to study the limits of certain sequences of minimal surfaces.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/L003163/1","grantId":"EP/L003163/1","fundValue":"13013","fundStart":"2013-08-25","fundEnd":"2014-08-24","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Giuseppe  Tinaglia","coPersons":[],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
