{"id":"4333F672-8FE2-4FE6-A48B-D4673368C062","title":"Against Value in the Arts","abstractText":"&quot;Against Value in the Arts&quot; brings together thirteen academics and artists from a diverse range of disciplines and artforms, including the history of art, anthropology, literature, languages, political science, music, philosophy, theatre, poetry and cultural studies. Its advances will be of benefit to that inter- and multi-disciplinary set of academics, but also much more widely, including members of the public, arts administrators, the third-sector, educationalists and teachers, and artists. The kinds of ideology this proposal contests are not limited to the UK, so this research is international in its scope. The use of cultural audit, the promotion of entrenched hierarchies via conservative and consumerist dogma, and the assumption of commensurability via economic exchange are global phenomena. \n\n&quot;Against Value in the Arts&quot; sounds like a counter-intuitive way to go about describing and defending the value of the arts. This project proposes, however, that it is often the staunchest defenders of art who do it the most harm, by suppressing its dissenting voice, by neutralizing its painful truths, and by instrumentalizing its potentiality, so that rather than expanding the autonomy of thought and feeling of the artist and the audience, it makes art self-satisfied, or otherwise an echo-chamber for the limited self-description of people's desires. \n\nThis project does not argue that the arts have no value; quite the opposite. It argues instead that value judgments can behave insidiously, and incorporate aesthetic, ethical or ideological values fundamentally opposed to the &quot;value&quot; they purportedly name and describe. It argues that even the most ostensibly virtuous of values can become oppressive when disseminated bureaucratically, and as a set of official renderings or statements of artistic accounts, also known as audit culture. \n\n&quot;Against Value in the Arts&quot; argues that the greatest possible value of the arts has been, and might continue to be to oppose, rigorously and constitutively, dominant and dominating ascriptions of value. \n\n&quot;Against Value&quot; proposes that the best way to engage critically with our society is to suspend presumptions of value, to engender instead a radical indeterminacy, to propose an incommensurability, the critique of any &quot;common measure&quot;, even if that common measure pretends to be as neutral as &quot;value&quot;. It seeks to antagonize questions about who gets to ascribe value, and how, and to interpret those ascriptions ideologically.\n\n&quot;Against Value&quot; will attend to the following: \n\n - The Value of &quot;Value&quot;. Is the promotion of value in and of itself a virtue? How does it become coercive? How might value in one sphere mean the degradation of value in another? How does value relate to commodification? How does value make assumptions damaging to experimentation and freedom? \n\n - Theories of Audit. Description (always flawed, always partial) is installed as both aim and outcome by cultural auditing. Audit therefore alters the object it seeks to study. Auditing began in economics, but has since been taken up in management, and across the public sector, in part because it can be used to pursue political ends by those in power. How can we refuse to adhere to always partial &quot;self-description&quot;, as curtailed by the categories and presumed outcomes of the audit, on behalf of an open-ended, indeterminate, and patient record? How does auditing reflect on contemporary issues such as privacy? \n\n - Theories of Exchange: Society is dominated by the exchange values, in particular, the belief that everything can be exchanged via the medium of money. \n\n - Dissent, Democracy, Liberality, Emancipation, Trust, Care, Privacy. The project will conclude with reflections on alternative values, and the ways in which value, audit, and exchange may impact damagingly upon them.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/L006022/1","grantId":"AH/L006022/1","fundValue":"26670","fundStart":"2013-09-01","fundEnd":"2014-05-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  The Against Value 'critical review' has been submitted to the AHRC college. It argues that funders should make claims of value for the arts and culture more complex, that they should understand the counterintuitive results of the auditing of values, i.e., that values can be damaged by their auditing, and that artworks broadly understood may well rightly stand in opposition to dominant and dominating notions of cultural, ethical, social and economic value, even when those values are ostensibly virtuous. \n\nThis critical review feeds into reflections by the AHRC on the way in which it understands, describes and defends the value of the arts, in light of its funding obligations. The conclusion to the critical review advocated a model of ethnographic listening. It reads, 'listening, which is not itself of necessity or absolutely a virtue, is a practice and methodology of incommensurability. The question of the value of the arts shouldn't be answered. An ethnographic model of listening is preferable to a value-laden audit culture (aims and outcomes) for arts funding in order to maintain the incommensurability of the arts from its host cultures, and culture from society. This is to make sure to fail (to fail better) to repress a critical dissensus from dominant and dominating systems of value, to look askance at the impropriety of irrecuperable artworks, and to save the arts from its defenders.' \n\nThere have been a number of smaller examples of the way the thesis of Against Value enters into debates. For example DanceHE referred to the Against Value thesis in its 'Independent Dance Higher Education Roundtable in September 2014. As the Against Value project is promoted via talks and publications in the coming years I will update these impacts.

Audit culture describes a set of practices that have extended from economics, through management and into education and arts' administration. Against Value demonstrates that these practices do not simply describe their subjects, but actively alters the culture which they seek to describe. \n\nAgainst Value provides a critical and theoretical account of 'value'.\n\nAgainst Value advocates for the suspension, negation or dissent from value since value is used as a coercive function within an audit culture. \n\nAgainst Value proposes a number of alternative values, and pre-empt the ways in which they too may be damaged by the auditing of cultural value. \n\nAgainst Value proves the thesis that one of the greatest possible value of the arts has been, and might continue be to suspend, negate or oppose, rigorously and constitutively, dominant and dominating ascriptions of value.\n\nAgainst Value articulates the current discourse around value as part of a constrictive consensus to which can be opposed Jacques Ranci?re's theory of dissensus: 'the political persists as long as there is a dissensus about the givens of a particular situation'.\n\nAgainst Value understands that the auditing of values pervades the fabric of people's work-lives and increasingly their everyday. 'Positive' values (happiness, participation, transparency) become damaging when enforced by audit and the genealogy of value uncovers figures of resentment, disenchantment and alienation fostered by a combination of domination by exchange-value and the complicity in that system of social and cultural values. \n\nAgainst Value argues that the arts can, and perhaps should, be critical of iterations of value, no matter how ostensibly virtuous are those values. It is often the staunchest defenders of art who do it the most harm, by suppressing or mollifying its dissenting voice, by neutralizing its painful truths, and by instrumentalizing its potentiality, so that rather than expanding the autonomy of thought and feeling of the artist and the audience, it makes art self-satisfied, or otherwise an echo-chamber for the limited and limiting self-description of people's lives. \n\nThe conclusion proposes that an ethnographic model of listening is preferable to a value-laden audit culture (aims and outcomes) for arts funding in order to maintain the incommensurability of the arts from its host cultures, and culture from society. This is to encourage a critical dissensus from dominant systems of value. The practice to be developed is &quot;being able to pay attention to people who themselves have other things on their minds&quot; (Strathern). The Against Value project continues. \n\nI am co-editing a collection of essays with Dr Bob Mckay (University of Sheffield) and Dr Emile Bojesen University of Winchester). We are currently seeking a publishing contract. \n\nI am developing the 'critical review' of the Against Value project into a monograph. I am currently seeking a publishing contract.
