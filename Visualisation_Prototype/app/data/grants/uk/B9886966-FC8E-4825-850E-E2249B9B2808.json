{"id":"B9886966-FC8E-4825-850E-E2249B9B2808","title":"A compact neutron/gamma imager for nuclear security applications","abstractText":"In this project we will develop a compact, portable imaging detector for mixed-field fast neutron and gamma ray imaging for nuclear security applications. The detector uses digital data acquisition methods combined with the latest type of plastic scintillator that provides real-time neutron/gamma discrimination and imaging performance.\n\nThe proposed digital n/gamma detection technology has come from neutron/gamma detection methods developed within the STFC nuclear physics programmes. Various digital pulse processing algorithms and methods have been developed for position sensitivity and n/gamma discrimination in a variety of nuclear physics detectors, including those used in the AGATA array and the HISPEC programme at FAIR/GSI. Neutron detection techniques using liquid scintillators and pulse shape discrimination methods have been developed at the DEMON array at GANIL and have recently been upgraded for to a digital data acquisition system. \n\nThe proposed device will be developed for use in nuclear security n/gamma imaging applications, and has been designed to meet the requirements of the Nuclear Security group at AWE Aldermaston. The project will principally address the Global Challenge Security theme, in the areas of border security and nuclear containment and remediation. However the n/gamma imaging and detection capability of these device will also have application to environmental radioactivity monitoring within the Global Challenge Environment theme.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/M007162/1","grantId":"ST/M007162/1","fundValue":"57865","fundStart":"2015-07-01","fundEnd":"2016-06-30","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Paul Jonathan Sellin","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Surrey","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
