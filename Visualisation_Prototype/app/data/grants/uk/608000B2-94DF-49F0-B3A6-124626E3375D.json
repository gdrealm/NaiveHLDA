In most economic applications, the environment in which stopping decisions are taken is assumed to be stationary. The predictions of models using this assumption are at odds with empirical observations. Reservation wages of unemployed workers decline in the duration of the unemployment spell; prices of houses fall with time on the market; research projects are sometimes started and later abandoned. This project develops a simple model of optimal stopping where the economic environment changes as a result of learning. From a methodological point of view, the main contribution will be the development of a framework that captures essential features of the learning problem and yet is analytically tractable. The model will be general enough to accommodate a number of applications as special cases; but also simple enough to yield qualitative comparative statics results that shed light on the key economic forces that result from the dynamic linkage between decision periods. This will provide analytical foundations for the empirical study of eg unemployment duration, or the timing of property sales; and the dynamics of reservation wages or property prices.\n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-0925","grantId":"RES-062-23-0925","fundValue":"85913","fundStart":"2008-03-01","fundEnd":"2009-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Robin Anthony Mason","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
