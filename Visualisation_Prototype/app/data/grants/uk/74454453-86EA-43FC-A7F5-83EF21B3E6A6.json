Inequalities in later outcomes such as education, employment, physical and mental health have been found to develop very early on in life as a result of differential early childhood exposure to risk factors. Two key factors in recent demographic and labour market change - the timing of childbearing and the employment of mothers - also vary markedly between individuals in contemporary Britain. This research will explore the relationship between the timing of motherhood, the employment and child care decisions of mothers and child outcomes.</p>\n\n<p>This proposed research focuses on outcomes for children in two key areas: first, the age at which their mother had her first child, and second her participation in employment and associated child care arrangements. In each case the outcomes may be the consequences of factors antecedent to the timing of births or entry to employment, so the research will investigate their determinants as well as their consequences. This research will review and extend existing analyses of the Millennium Cohort Study, National Child Development Study and British Cohort Study of 1970.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-163-25-0002","grantId":"RES-163-25-0002","fundValue":"144212","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2009-01-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Kirstine  Hansen","coPersons":["Heather Evelyn Joshi"],"organisation":"Institute of Education","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
