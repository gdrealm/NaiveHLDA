For example, more children today are diagnosed as having Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) than in the past. However, this could be due to better understanding of the condition by teachers and doctors. It is important to understand whether or not rates of ADHD, and of other child mental health problems such as emotional symptoms and behavioural problems, have actually increased in the population as a whole. This requires data from unselected representative national samples assessed in the same way over time. In our previous research we have shown that emotional and behavioural problems in adolescence have in fact become increasingly common in recent years. At present we don't know whether the same holds true for mental health problems in pre-adolescent children. The study will answer this question by using data on the mental health of seven-year-olds from five large UK cohorts studied between 1965 and 2008. Each study has used identical or closely comparable child mental health screens. \n\nAnother important issue is what might explain any changes in children's mental health. Very few studies have looked at this, because comparable information about possible contributory factors and mental health is only rarely available for the same individuals when combining cohorts across time. Mental health trends in adolescence are partly explained by increasing rates of parental mental health problems, by changes in youth drinking and drug use, and by increasingly stressful educational experiences. This type of research now needs to be undertaken in younger children. We will do this by testing whether rates of early known risk factors have changed across the five cohorts, and how such changes have contributed to trends in child mental health. We will focus on changes in pre- and peri-natal risks (e.g. prenatal maternal smoking, prematurity and low birth weight), in early neurodevelopmental risk factors (e.g. head injury and epilepsy), and early family adversity (e.g. parental involvement, parental divorce and family poverty).\nOur third main aim is to test whether the impact of child mental health problems on children's later health and wellbeing has changed. In particular, we want to see whether any increases in mental health problems at age seven foreshadow increases in mental health problems in later childhood and adolescence. We also want to examine the consequences for children's psychosocial adaptation, including their peer relationships and educational success. This is made possible because three of the cohorts are being followed as they grow older. Information from middle childhood and adolescence is now available for two of these cohorts, previously assessed at age seven in 1965 and the late 1990s. Longitudinal outcome data will also soon become available for the most recent cohort of children who are currently being assessed at age eleven.\n\nUnderstanding whether rates of child mental health problems have changed, the reasons behind trends in child mental health, and the consequences for children's later development has important practical consequences. This information in crucial for better planning of services, for influencing national and local policy and priorities, and for identifying targets for intervention to improve the mental health of future generations of children.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/J01348X/1","grantId":"MR/J01348X/1","fundValue":"158271","fundStart":"2012-10-08","fundEnd":"2014-10-07","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Stephan  Collishaw","coPersons":["Andrew Richard Pickles","Anita  Thapar","Barbara  Maughan"],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
