All countries, including LICs are encouraged to adopt these new global standards. Members of the G20 have asked the Financial Stability Board, IMF and World Bank to study how global banking initiatives will impact developing and emerging economies, identifying this area as a key policy concern for promoting inclusive growth. To date the scant research on this question addresses almost exclusively emerging market economies. LIC governments and advisers have voiced an urgent need for LIC-specific analysis. \n\nThis project will be amongst the very first to look at how political institutions and processes - at both the domestic and global levels - shape the impact of global banking initiatives on LICs and their ability to harness financial flows for inclusive growth. The core research questions are: \n(1) How much de facto flexibility do LICs have in respect of the new regulatory standards, how much do they need, and under what conditions (economic and political; global, regional and national) should they adopt new regulatory standards? \n(2) What strategies for influencing global standard-setting processes and institutions are likely to yield the best outcomes for LICs?\n\nThe project combines two disciplinary approaches: political science and economics. It combines quantitative and qualitative analysis, and will generate new datasets. Outputs will include top-quality peer-reviewed academic publications and a series of tailored policy briefs. \n\nThe project has been designed to maximize impact through continuous direct engagement with policy-makers confronting the problems the research addresses. The design of the research questions has been undertaken in dialogue with LIC and developing country policy-makers. We will continue to engage policy-makers through semi-structured interviews; annual workshops; and through the project's Expert Advisory Board. The Board includes Vivienne Apopo (Director General, East African Development Bank), Mthuli Ncube (Chief Economist, African Development Bank), Amar Bhattacharya (Director, G24 Secretariat).\n\nKey beneficiaries are regulators, senior government officials, and other stakeholders in LICs engaged with promoting inclusive, sustainable growth. This includes the Community of African Banking Supervisors (CABS); the Banking Commission of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU); the Regulatory Committee of the Central Bank of Angola; the National Financial Supervision Council (NFSC) of Vietnam; the Commercial Bank Supervision Department of the Bank of Laos; and the Central Banks of Tanzania and Uganda. Our impact strategy leverages existing close links between several of our researchers and key stakeholders in LICs. \n\nThe project will enhance the capacity of LIC governments to make choices about financial regulation, and to ensure global standard-setting processes support these choices. It will also enhance the capacity of scholars and stakeholders in LICs to continue the research in-country: to this end we are working with in-country researchers on the case studies and engaging Southern stakeholders with targeted dissemination. We will engage directly with academic institutions in LICs, such as the Department of Economics, University of Dar es Salaam (Tanzania); the Departments of Economics and Law, University Ouaga II (Burkina Faso); the Economics and Management Faculty of Lom&eacute; and Kara Universities (Togo); the Economics Department, Agostinho Neto University (Angola); the Fulbright School (Vietnam, a partnership between Harvard Kennedy School and University of Economics, Ho Chi Minh City).\n\nThe project will enjoy a ready exploitation route, building on the excellent track record and extensive network of the Global Economic Governance Programme (GEG) and the Blavatnik School of Government, University of Oxford.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L012375/1","grantId":"ES/L012375/1","fundValue":"521634","fundStart":"2015-03-30","fundEnd":"2018-03-29","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Emily  Jones","coPersons":["Thorsten  Beck","Ngaire  Woods"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
