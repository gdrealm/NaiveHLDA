It has applied the sociology of scientific and technical knowledge to investigate implementation of environmental regulation.<br /><br />The key intellectual aims of the Network are to investigate an &quot;Adaptive&quot; form of River Basin Management (ARBM), first using a European case to explore how negotiation, adaptation, and poly-centrism, typify implementation of relevant Directives, especially in trans-boundary river basin management, and then considering how ARBM’s focus on negotiation, flexibility and subsidiarity will bear on what this European process suggests for Chinese river basin management.<br /><br />The international workshops that have taken place in the project have provided training in theory and methods in the examination of RBM (both “Integrated” and “Adaptive”) and environmental governance, as well as providing opportunities for doctoral students, post-doctoral fellows and early career researchers from the UK, EU and China to interact and exchange ideas and information about research experiences, in the company of senior scholars and practitioners from Europe and China.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/H008055/1","grantId":"ES/H008055/1","fundValue":"29002","fundStart":"2009-09-03","fundEnd":"2011-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Keith  Richards","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
