This maritime trade network was known as the Caravane maritime.\\n\\nBy better understanding the Caravane maritime we will better understand the historical roots of our current intra-Mediterranean relations. To do this, we need to bring together all the relevant scholars working on the various different aspects of this maritime traffic, including economic and social historians, literary scholars, specialists of Mediterranean studies and of the Ottoman world, as the Caravane maritime's surviving documentary evidence is spread throughout the Mediterranean in dozens of archives (often not catalogued and difficult to trace) and is written in several different languages. \\n\\nThis project will bring together in an international workshop leading academics from the United Kingdom, Italy, Turkey, Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria, Spain, France, Greece, the United States, Malta and Australia. This will create a framework for the exchange of the latest research methods and evidence. \\n\\nIn order to guarantee continuity and maximize the dissemination of research findings and evidence, the project will solicit papers for publication as an edited book, and be the first step in establishing a permanent research network that will create a dedicated website where bibliographies and documents could be stored for public access. \\n\\nThere is an urgency and timeliness to this project, due to the recent developments in Southern Europe and North Africa regarding the history of the region and the need for British scholarship to engage with this research, due to the important role played by British maritime and naval power in the Mediterranean at the time.\\n\\n\\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/F002777/1","grantId":"AH/F002777/1","fundValue":"18303","fundStart":"2007-09-01","fundEnd":"2008-01-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Maria  Fusaro","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Exeter","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
