Real research questions remain in this tradition, however, as this study will demonstrate. The data involved are most well-known, as in most contemporary German historic phonology; the researched task is to explain them, with an eye to elucidate &quot;What is a possible change?&quot; This study will show how a new idea in phonology ('Laryngeal Realism') permits a unified theory of several major German changes and of certain common types of change on a language-universal basis.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=112902/1","grantId":"112902/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2006-01-10","fundEnd":"2006-05-09","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  The main impact has been on those interested in the possibilities in phonological change and phonological theory. The term 'laryngeal realism', which I proposed for a central analytical concept in the research associated with this grant, has been adopted by the research community.

This project aims to understand the types of change that are possible in languages, focusing on a particular set of changes which are often called 'lenition'. The findings should be of interest to all those who work to understand how phonology works and how it can change. They should be of particular interest to those who aim to understand the history of the ideas involved. My findings provide a firm base for those who aim to advance such work.
