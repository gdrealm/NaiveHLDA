{"id":"A14B7F3F-1C56-4205-9FAA-CEDEA934822E","title":"PIXS: Portable Imaging X-ray Fluorescence System","abstractText":"There are a number of major challenges that have been identified for the scientific community which expertise from the STFC could help to address. Of these, disposal of nuclear waste (existing waste from the nuclear power industry and future waste from the planned new nuclear power stations) and the capture and storage of carbon dioxide are seen as critical for security of electricity supply and to reduce greenhouse warming. Subsurface repositories are one way in which these challenges may be addressed. Across the globe a significant amount of funding is being expended in exploring a variety of storage methods, repository types and monitoring systems.\n\nThe project aims to develop and test a prototype Portable Imaging X-ray Fluorescence System (PIXS) for use in geological repositories building on Space Research Centre expertise in XRF (imaging and non-imaging) for planetary exploration including Beagle 2 and the BepiColombo mission to Mercury. A current project to develop a handheld XRD/XRF instrument in conjunction with Bruker Elemental is also highly synergistic with the proposed development of PIXS.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/M007235/1","grantId":"ST/M007235/1","fundValue":"48761","fundStart":"2015-07-01","fundEnd":"2015-12-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"John Ernest Lees","coPersons":["Graeme M Hansford"],"organisation":"University of Leicester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
