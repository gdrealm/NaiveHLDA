Benign prostatic hyperplasia and cancer are increasingly prevalent. To find cures for these diseases it is essential to understand how the prostate grows and functions normally. All organs have their own population of stem cells which grow and develop into a variety of cells which communicate to form correct organ architecture and function. This occurs as a result of signals from the stem cell's own genes but also from signals provided by neighbouring cells, known as stroma. In the prostate, how this occurs is unknown. We propose to develop a model to grow gland-like structures from adult stem cells in the laboratory. The model will be employed to understand how stromal cells influence prostate cellular architecture. We aim to identify proteins which act as signals from the stroma to change epithelial shape. The shape of a cell has important effects on cell function. These experiments will increase our knowledge of how tissues develop and function. Development of tissue-like models based on human cells will provide a valuable gap between results from animal models and human clinical studies, to help understand the basic mechanisms of human physiology and disease. Such model systems will reduce the need for animal experimentation, which is currently the best way to investigate complex cell interactions in tissues. We anticipate the model will aid university directed research into human differentiation and disease mechanisms, but also for the pharmaceutical industry to screen new drugs for efficacy and safety in humans before trial.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E021409/1","grantId":"BB/E021409/1","fundValue":"327026","fundStart":"2007-06-01","fundEnd":"2010-05-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Anne  Collins","coPersons":["Norman James Maitland"],"organisation":"University of York","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
