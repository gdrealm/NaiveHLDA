A unique opportunity in Afar, Ethiopia.","abstractText":"Summary The African continent is slowly splitting apart along the East African rift valley, a 3000 km-long series of deep basins and flanking mountain ranges. This process may eventually lead to the formation of a new ocean, but on a time scale of millions of years. In the remote Afar depression in northern Ethiopia, Earth's outermost shell, usually a relatively rigid, 150 km-thick plate, has been stretched, thinned and heated to the point of rupture, to the extent that a new ocean is about to form. Below the surface, upwelling rocks from Earth's mantle below are partially melting, rising, and cooling. Here, we have the unprecedented opportunity to witness the process of plate rupture and upwelling of molten rock (magma). Normally, this process occurs within shallow seas, or along the established seafloor spreading centres deep under the oceans; in Afar, though, we can actually walk across the region as it happens. Satellite observations of the earth show that tectonic plates move apart, on average, very slowly: usually at a few centimetres per year, or about the rate of fingernail growth. Very occasionally, however, sudden large movements occur, often with devastating consequences. In September 2005, a series of fissures opened along a 60 km section of the Afar depression, as the plate responded catastrophically to forces pulling it apart. Over about a week, the rift pulled apart by 8 metres, and dropped down by up to 1 metre. As told by local people, a series of earthquakes signalled the rise of molten rock to the surface on September 26, and ash darkened the air locally for 3 days. At the same time, satellites tracking the region showed that the surface above nearby volcanoes subsided by as much as 3 metres, as magma was injected along the fissure below the surface. The rapidity and immense length of rupture are not unexpected, but have never before been measured directly. The Afar depression is so hot and dry that almost no vegetation obscures the rocks exposed on its top surface; this also means that we can use satellites to image them and to measure the way that the Earth's surface changes as faults move, and as pressurised molten rock moves up and along the length of fissures within the rift valley. In the nine months since the first major earthquakes, more dramatic surface changes have continued to take place, and earthquakes continue to stir the earth. We are proposing a major set of experiments that will bring together experts on Earth deformation, and on magma sources, movement and eruption to this unique natural laboratory. Over the next five years, a team of UK, Ethiopian and US scientists will collaborate to find answers to fundamental questions of plate tectonics: . How do the different layers of the plate stretch apart? . Where does molten rock form and rise to form new oceanic crust? . How does the molten rock move up to the surface? Satellites will image the earth from above, and sensors will record sound waves from distant and near earthquakes and natural magnetic signals to image the thickness of the rock layers the plate comprises, and discover where the magma is located prior to eruption. We will also collect and analyse the composition of rocks from young volcanoes in the same region. The Earth history deduced from compositional variations in space and time will give us clues as to when and how often similar sorts of events happened in the past / and may happen again in the future.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/E006469/1","grantId":"NE/E006469/1","fundValue":"125414","fundStart":"2007-03-01","fundEnd":"2013-02-28","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Timothy John Wright","coPersons":["David  Pyle"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":" The aim of our project was to understand better how new crust forms in areas where the Earth's tectonic plates are pulling apart. In the Afar region, Ethiopia, the plates are tearing open very slowly - at about an average of 16 - 20 mm per year. Geological evidence shows that most of this movement happens in the narrow 'rift zone', right on the plate boundary. This is also where most of the earthquakes happen (breaking the crust) and where the volcanism is focussed. We studied lavas from one of these rift zones (the Dabbahu Manda Hararo rift) to find out (i) for how long the rift has been active and (ii) to use the compositions of the erupted lavas to understand better the conditions under which they formed. \n\n\n\nBy using a very sensitive dating technique, we were able to show that the lavas in this rift appear to have all erupted from a very narrow region of the rift for at least the past 200,000 years. Over this time, the rift has gradually widened (as the plates creep apart), at a rate that matches the overall rate of separation of the Arabian plate from the North African plate. This a very exciting result, because it gives us the first evidence for when the present-day rift system became stabilised. We published this result in a short paper in 2013 (Ferguson et al., Nature Communications, 4, 1416, 2013 http:dx.doi.org/10.1038/ncomms2410). \n\n\n\nSubsequently, we have completed work on the young basaltic lavas of the rift system. The compositions of these lavas contain subtle, but important, clues to their conditions of formation, including the depth (pressure) and temperature at which the melts separated from their source region in the mantle. We find that the basalts in Afar formed deep (greater than about 80 kilometres), and from hotter than normal mantle. The importance of this is two-fold: first, the plates beneath Afar must still be relatively thick (otherwise melting would continue to shallower depths); and second, melting beneath Afar is still being influenced by the thermal effects of a long-lived plume (if the mantle was cooler, there would be no melting). In Afar, spreading of the plates has been and continues to be sufficiently slow that the plates remain thick even though the underlying mantle is hot. This result was published in Nature in July 2013 (Ferguson et al., Nature 499, 70-73, http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature12292) These results are of general geological interest, since they add more detail to our understanding of how and when continental rift zones, like those in Africa, may transition to become ocean rifts.
