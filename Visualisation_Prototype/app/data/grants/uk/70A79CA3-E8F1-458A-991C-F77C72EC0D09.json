{"id":"70A79CA3-E8F1-458A-991C-F77C72EC0D09","title":"Modular operads and topological field theories","abstractText":"This is a research in pure mathematics which is at the junction of several mathematical disciplines and theoretical physics. It concerns certain aspects of topology and algebraic geometry which uses methods of other areas of mathematics and mathematical physics such as representation theory, quantum field theory and combinatorics.Feynman graphs originally appeared in the work of theoretical physicists studying path integrals appearing in perturbative quantum field theory. During the last 10-15 years, due to efforts of such people as Kontsevich and Witten it became clear thatFeynman diagrams could be used to great effect to solve problems in pure mathematics.The notion central to the proposed research is that of a modular operad, whose underlying structure is governed by the combinatorics of Feynman graphs. This notion of an operad originally appeared in algebraic topology but recently found important applications in mathematical physics. An algebra over a modular operad is an abstraction of the notion of an associative algebra with a compatible inner product; such algebras appear naturally in various physical theories. Understanding these structures will likely shed new light on the intersection theory on the moduli spaces of curves, one of the most important and deep problems of modern algebraic geometry. This project will be carried out at the University of Leicester. It requires assistance of a post-doctoral fellow and experts from other universities in the UK and abroad.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F031513/1","grantId":"EP/F031513/1","fundValue":"277646","fundStart":"2008-10-15","fundEnd":"2011-10-14","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The results of the paper `Feynman diagrams and minimal models for operadic algebras', joint with J.

","person":"Andrey  Lazarev","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Leicester","findingsText":" One of the results of the research undertaken is a very general formulation of the minimal model theorem for algebras over a modular operad. The explicit formula obtained expresses the structure maps of minimal models in terms of summation over general Feynman graphs. This unifies and generalizes efforts of several other researchers who obtain this formula for special choices of an operad. We also obtained a version of this result when the underlying spaces of an algebra is not required to be finite-dimensional. This is necessary since most of the intersting examples coming from geometry are of this type.\n\n\n\nAnother collection of results obtained concerns the notion of a Maurer-Cartan moduli set which comes up in various areas, such as deformation theory, differential geometry and mathematical physics. Working with J. Chuang we initiated a very general approach to this notion and applied it to obtain information on Hochschild and Chevalley-Eilenberg cohomology of A-infinity and L-infinity algebras as well as their cyclic analogues. It turned out that the developed technology has applications to rational homotopy theory and I was able to use it to construct manifestly homotopy invariant rational models for mapping spaces between topological spaces satisfying some mild conditions. This opens up a new way in which infinity algebras can be linked to rational homotopy theory and gives rise to many new problems.\n\n\n\nWorking with T. Schedler I constructed a curved analogue of Kontsevich's graph complex. One surprising result was that its cohomology is nontrivial and it is possible to calculate it completely. This is the first example of a complete calculation of graph homology. We also give examples of nontrivial characteristic classes coming from curved cyclic infinity algebras.\n\n\n\nWorking with J. Cranch (a research assistant under the present grant) we investigated the notion of a noncommutative Frobenius manifold originally due to Natanzon and constructed some new examples. James worked extensively on the notion of an algebraic theory in the setting of quasi-categories developed by Joyal and Lurie. In particular, he studied the theory of commutative monoids (which turned out to be essentially a 2-category). He related this concept to the classical notion of an E-infinity monoid as well as Lurie's notion of a commutative algebra object.\n\n\n\nWorking with A. Hamilton I completed a large project which started a long time ago. We gave a unified treatment of homotopy algebras and their cohomology based on noncommutative geometry and applied it to give a conceptual construction of Kontsevich's characteristic classes. The funding of the present research have been reported in numerous presentations on nationla and international conferences. The results have been published in leading peer-reviewed journals and put on arXiv. Other","dataset":"gtr"}
