{"id":"7FFAAB28-6495-424A-A5BF-4DCA04715825","title":"Quantum Coherence: Joint Proposal for Optimising UK Research Capacity and Capability","abstractText":"The defining character of quantum mechanics is coherence / the superposition of correlated states of many particles. Quantum correlated and entangled states lie at the heart of several major areas of physics, especially quantum optics, atomic physics and quantum condensed matter. The ability to control precisely a broad range of systems from ultracold atoms in optical lattices to internal states of molecules to semiconductor nanostructures has led to important breakthroughs in the understanding and potential applications of entanglement. Because the same principles underlie the rich but sometimes impenetrable physics of quantum matter, these advances open a window on challenging problems in materials. The fortunate fertility already evident in condensed matter materials suggests strongly that major benefits will accrue from exerting full quantum control of complex systems. Within this proposal we shall tackle this demanding new challenge. The underlying concepts and technologies of coherent control and manipulation in atomic, molecular and optical physics are now sufficiently established that it is possible to consider the synthesis of designer quantum states of atoms and molecules that can address a number of outstanding problems in condensed matter and optical physics. Furthermore, the ability to build large-scale quantum coherent systems represents such a new capability that we can anticipate new physics, as yet unimagined, as well as new technologies, to emerge. The method of approach will be to increase UK research capacity by the appointment of new faculty and the establishment of state of the art research laboratories and facilities, and the nurturing of collaborative research programs across several institutions. This will be complemented by implementing new training programs at the graduate and postdoctoral researcher level that will be broadly available to the UK community.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E036066/1","grantId":"EP/E036066/1","fundValue":"1812080","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2013-01-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Alex  Halliday","coPersons":["Roger L Davies","Keith  Burnett","Ian Alexander Walmsley"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
