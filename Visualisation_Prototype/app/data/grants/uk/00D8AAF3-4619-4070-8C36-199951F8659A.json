After being bitten, the infected human will experience two stages of disease: the first stage is the blood-based stage of the disease and the second stage affects the central nervous system (CNS), which occurs once the parasite penetrates the brain from the blood. The infected human will die if Stage 2 HAT is left untreated. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) makes the CNS stage difficult to treat because it prevents 99% of all known drugs from entering the brain from the blood, including some anti-HAT drugs. Those anti-HAT drugs that do enter the brain are toxic compounds in their own right and have serious side effects. Pentamidine is a less toxic blood stage drug, which our research has shown has a limited ability to cross the BBB due to its removal by efflux transporters, which are membrane proteins that remove toxic substances from cells. Furthermore transporters are considered essential in the mode of action of pentamidine against the parasites that cause HAT. The objective of this multi-disciplinary study is to use nanotechnology to both improve the delivery of pentamidine to the brain and into the parasite, whilst reducing its side effects. \n\nIn doing so, we will create a novel formulation that will encapsulate pentamidine. Specifically, we will use an amphiphilic polymer (a long molecule composed of many repeating units, bearing water-loving and water-hating blocks), which spontaneously self-assembles into small aggregates called micelles. These micelles can be used to encapsulate the drug, thus prolonging its circulation time and protecting it. In addition, these specific polymers (namely, Pluronics) have been shown to interact with efflux transporters and thus allow passage of the drug across the BBB. This indicates that this improved drug formulation has potential to treat Stage 2 disease. \n\nThe optimal formulation will be determined using an iterative screening process that will utilise a series of cutting-edge research techniques from various biophysical, pharmaceutical and biological disciplines. The end product of this research will be a formulation which will be ready to be taken to pre-clinical testing for the treatment of Stage 2 HAT.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/K015451/1","grantId":"MR/K015451/1","fundValue":"689480","fundStart":"2013-04-19","fundEnd":"2014-12-18","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Sarah Ann Thomas","coPersons":["Mark Ian  Christie","Christian  Lorenz","Cecile Ayako Dreiss","Simon  Croft","Shanta  Persaud","Vanessa  Yardley"],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
