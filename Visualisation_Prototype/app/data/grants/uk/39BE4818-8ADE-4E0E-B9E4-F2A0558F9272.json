While there are many health implications as a result of this disease one that becomes of serious concern is the development of gum disease. Infected and bleeding gums are at the mild end of the effects â€“ more aggressive disease leads to the loss of the bone that holds the teeth. At this point it is necessary to undertake surgery in order to try and restore the height of the jaw bone. This grant outlines a new approach to such surgery using an advanced material that can stimulate new bone to grow (through the delivery of a chemical analogue of a protein known as hedgehog) but has the mechanical strength needed to resist the forces in the mouth, as well as being degradable. This material will also have applications in other areas that require the delivery of a drug from a stiff material, including repair of traumatic injuries to the legs and arms that currently require amputation.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0701855","grantId":"G0701855","fundValue":"99285","fundStart":"2008-09-01","fundEnd":"2009-08-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Paul Graeme BuxtonAnne Margaret Young","coPersons":["Nikolaos  Mardas"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
