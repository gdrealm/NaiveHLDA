During development all of these cells must be born and it is clear that some cells, referred to as 'stem' or 'progenitor' cells, can give birth to different types of cells by successively dividing. Understanding which cells function as progenitors, how they are regulated and what types of cells they give birth to, is fundamental to our understanding of how the body develops. Furthermore, understanding these events will reveal which processes become abnormal in developmental diseases and, potentially, will enable us to harness these cells therapeutically. This research proposal addresses these questions in the context of the developing nervous system. In our brains there are two major classes of cells, the electrically excitable neurons and the non-excitable glial cells. Originally it was believed that these two classes diverged very early during development and so represented different cell families or 'lineages'. However, recent work has indicated that an intriguing subset of glial cells in the developing nervous system, called 'radial glia', exhibit features of progenitor cells and may give birth to the majority of neurons in parts of our brains. In this series of studies we plan to examine the behaviour of radial glial cells in the context of an intact, developing nervous system. Using non-invasive, high-resolution imaging methods we will watch the behaviour of live radial glial cells and how they communicate with other cells in the immature brain. We will explore whether radial glia function as progenitor cells and will trace the identity of the types of cells that they give birth to. Finally, we will examine whether ongoing communication between radial glia and their neighbouring cells are important for the way brain cells become specialised for their different functions. We anticipate that these experiments will contribute novel and important data to the field of developmental biology by characterising the events surrounding the birth and maturation of cells in the living brain. The work aims to improve our understanding and treatment of neurodevelopmental disorders in humans, and it will benefit scientists that are investigating ways of growing nerve cells in order to repair damaged brains.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E015476/1","grantId":"BB/E015476/1","fundValue":"373562","fundStart":"2007-09-01","fundEnd":"2010-08-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Colin  Akerman","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":" The project was part of a systematic investigation into the processes that control the development of the central nervous system. It combined a series of sophisticated techniques to directly observe cellular changes during early brain development. The project investigated the signals that control how neurons are born during development (neurogenesis) and how neurons then mature to form functional circuits of connected cells. This is an area of substantial interest within the scientific community Although the work addresses basic biological questions, there are wider groups of researchers that will also benefit from the findings. Researchers working upon therapeutic uses for stem cells stand to benefit from the work. The biology of stem and progenitor cells in the nervous system is of wide interest to human health, reflecting not only their emerging functions in the brain but also their potential therapeutic role in neurological disease.
