{"id":"AF8CB11D-C646-4A7C-B641-B124DA52DB86","title":"A lightweight genome browser for data integration, exploration and interactive figures","abstractText":"Genome browsers are important tools for visualising, interpreting, and\nunderstanding the wealth of information now available about genome\nstructure, its functions, and the variations that occur between\nindividuals. In research environments, they are frequently used for\nvisually checking the quality of new data, looking for patterns and\ncorrelations, and inspecting the results of analysis tools. Browsers\nare also important for education, and -- especially with the arrival of\ndirect-to-consumer genetic testing -- may also be of interest to the\ngeneral public.\n\nHistorically, the most commonly-used genome browsers have been relatively\nstatic web applications, displaying a portion of the genome as a single\nimage which must be reloaded to move or zoom the view, leaving major\nbarriers to interactivity. The alternative is heavy-client desktop\nsoftware which is more interactive but requires installation. Dalliance\ntakes advantage of newer features of web browsers to build a fully\ninteractive genome browsing tool as a web application.\n\nBecause Dalliance does all the data integration and drawing work in code\nthat runs within the end users' web browsers, it is relatively\nstraightforward to add an instance to a new web page without any\nserver-side work. The Dalliance instance can potentially be just one of\nmany elements on a complex web page. This leads to the possibility of\ncreating many kinds of applications which combine spatial views of\ngenomic data with other information. We are already seeing a number of\ncases where academic and industrial researchers have used Dalliance as a\nbrowser component of their website, including the interpretation of DTC\ngenetic tests (see letters of support). You can even think of Dalliance\nas allowing the creation of interactive figures, which can accompany\ndatabase records, analysis results, or publications.\n\nWe propose a program of further development work, rewriting the main\nrendering code to improve performance, and splitting the user interface\ninto components. This means embedders have the flexibility to offer\neither a simplified interface (e.g. more appropriate to an interactive\nfigure), a fully-featured interface with a complete set of navigation\ncontrols tools to control the integration of additional datasets, or\nanything in between.\n\nWe will add support for additional genomic data formats -- notably,\nbetter support for genetic variation data. We will also update the\nmetadata model, and support additional metadata sources such as the\n&quot;track hub&quot; structures used by the UCSC browser. This will enable easy\nintegration of existing data from the ENCODE project, and offer a simple\nroute for sharing biological datasets with enough metadata to allow\ndisplay in a genome browser with descriptions and track selection user\ninterfaces.\n\nFinally, we plan to organise a federated data workshop to interact with\ndevelopers and encourage the development of federated solutions for sharing\nbiological data. This will be modelled on the popular DAS workshop that\nhas been organised at Hinxton in the past, but with a broader aim of\nsupporting and encouraging data integration in a variety of formats,\nnotably the modern style of indexed binary data and trackhub-style\nmetadata which allows discoverable data to be published with extremely\nlow requirements for server hardware or administration.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/K015427/1","grantId":"BB/K015427/1","fundValue":"84999","fundStart":"2013-04-08","fundEnd":"2014-10-07","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Tim  Hubbard","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The Wellcome Trust  Sanger Institute","findingsText":" We have investigated rendering strategies for genomic data visualisation in a web environment and developed a new renderer based on the HTML5 canvas system. Our renderer, integrated into the Biodalliance genome browser, supports the whole of the DAS styling model (as implemented by, e.g. Ensembl), plus extensions motivated by discussion with users and collaborators working on genetic association studies and high-throughput sequencing results\n\nWe have added support in Biodalliance for new formats such as BED and VCF (important for study of genetic variation) and substantially improved visualisation of BAM files produced by high-throughput sequencing experiments.\n\nWe have worked on approaches for discovering and viewing large sets of genomic data, including complete support for UCSC-compatible &amp;amp;quot;track hubs&amp;amp;quot;.\n\nWe have developed, extended, and documented APIs for other tools to interact with the Biodalliance genome-browser component, and to allow plugins for supporting new data types.\n\nWe have improved support for password-protected access to secure datasets. We have developed and documented an open source genome browser component which can be freely and straightforwardly used as part of a larger tool for, e.g., genome annotation or variant calling assessment, or which can be built into a web site for the presentation of research findings (e.g. GENCODE, UK10K).
