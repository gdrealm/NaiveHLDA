However, more abstract concept formulation and development is poorly supported, especially where uncertainty is an inherent characteristic. Furthermore, computer-aided design and decision-support tends to be domain specific. There is little or no exploitation of cross-domain experience. The Network proposes to investigate, develop and implement research and development agendas that have the potential to redress both these imbalances. During the early stages of any design or decision-making activity people play a major common role. Differing aspects need to be concurrently considered. For instance those relating to multiple options, constraints and objectives; human-based knowledge and experience; the environment for which we are designing and the people affected by our designs / decisions. Inherent uncertainty and poor problem definition initially exacerbate the situation. Preliminary computer-based problem representations may comprise fuzzy concepts and sparse information. Further, such representations change as information and knowledge accumulates from initial search and exploration and associated human assimilation. Human experience plays a major role. People-centred systems are therefore required that meld such knowledge with computer-based simulation, search and exploration, data processing and data visualization. The decision-maker should become immersed in the system involved in an iterative process of data generation; evaluation and analysis; subsequent modification of the computer-based representation and further exploration of the redefined space. The utility of relatively established computational intelligence technologies will be reassessed in the light of their current usage. Network investigations will extend into current associated areas of research and the potential of new, emerging technologies. These will not be considered stand-alone but will be investigated alongside a range of well-established enabling computational technologies to ensure successful integration. The complexity of the domain is such that much further collaborative working is required to identify such primary research and development areas that will result in generic, people-centred computational systems for early design and decision-making processes. Very significant cross-disciplinary interest is evident. The potential of people-centred computation across varied decision-making processes is now being identified. Business/organizational structure, financial systems and resource allocation/scheduling are just a small example of areas that can benefit from the envisaged systems. It is our intention to develop the Network membership to ensure that such areas are well-covered and are in a position to benefit from collective reasoning, collaborative research, workshops and training events. It is also essential that members representing the large body of research relating to statistical, intelligent systems and more deterministic approaches to dealing with uncertainty and risk in decision processes are included. Much mutual benefit could arise from a melding of established techniques and strategies and emerging people-centred systems. The strength of the Network will lie in the collaboration of seemingly disparate cognitive disciplines that require a common core expertise to support decision-making processes. The result will be the identification of mutually symbiotic design and decision-making environments which create new potential interfaces for capturing and enabling discovery and innovation.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E001939/1","grantId":"EP/E001939/1","fundValue":"61899","fundStart":"2006-06-30","fundEnd":"2008-12-29","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Ian  Parmee","coPersons":["Janet Mary  Noyes"],"organisation":"University of the West of England","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
