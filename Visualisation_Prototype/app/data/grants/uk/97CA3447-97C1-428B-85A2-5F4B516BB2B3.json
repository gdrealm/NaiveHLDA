Supported by a NERC grant (NER/O/S/2001/01262, running 01/10/2003 to 26/12/2007), we have taken a major step towards the development of a new generation, EBE (element-by-element) finite element geodynamo code that has two main significant advantages: it is particularly suitable for modern massively parallel computers achieving nearly linear scalability and it is highly flexible to be capable of incorporating geophysical realism such as non-spherical geometry and local variations. This application requests funding for one PDRA at Exeter to continue/extend our existing productive research on the asymptotic convection study and geodynamo modeling and to advance our understanding of the spatial and temporal structure of non-magnetic nonlinear convection in the Earth's liquid core and of how the convection-driven geodynamo operating in an electrically conducting fluid core and the pattern of magnetic flux emanating from the Earth's liquid core are affected by an electrically heterogeneous lower mantle.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/G003548/1","grantId":"NE/G003548/1","fundValue":"343096","fundStart":"2010-05-01","fundEnd":"2013-09-30","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  My findings presented in my theory have been confirmed several lab experiments.
