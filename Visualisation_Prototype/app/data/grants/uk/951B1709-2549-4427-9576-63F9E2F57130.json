The recent Office of Nuclear Regulation Weightman report on the Fukushima accident has confirmed that Fukushima showed no reason to curtail nuclear operation or nuclear new build in the UK and in 2012 it is expected that EDF will start work on the first new nuclear power station at Hinkley Point. Perhaps one key issue/lesson learnt from the Fukushima accident, especially in Japan, was the need for continued research into nuclear safety to support existing and new build nuclear power plant programmes. Until recently there has been relatively little UK research into nuclear power and as such there are also relatively few young academics truly in the field. There is also a growing need to train new young talented engineers and physicists in nuclear engineering disciplines if the new build programme is to be successful and to help rebuild the UKs reputation as a world leader in this field. \nThis proposal is made to try to address some of these issues and at the same time explore a new growing area of modelling, known as peridynamics, with great potential for modelling many problems within the nuclear engineering materials area. \nThe project aims to investigate two nuclear fuel problems thus far difficult to model: pellet-cladding interactions (PCI) in nuclear fuels and oxide phase change/spallation on zirconium alloy cladding of water-cooled reactors. These problems are ideal for a mixed finite element (FE) -peridynamics modelling approach. \nBoth PCI and oxide growth and spallation require a model that is able to deal with a ductile material (cladding) bonded to a brittle material (UO2 ceramic fuel) under complex stress states, geometries and incorporating heat transfer and material heterogeneity. The peridynamics approach is able to model material with defects without some of the numerical issues inherent within the FE approach. However, combining the two modelling techniques can bring the advantages of both techniques together.\nThis project will develop a peridynamics implementation into the finite element code Abaqus. The models will then be developed further to model the specific problems of PCI and oxide spallation problems described. The project will also develop a new young post doctoral researcher and a early career academic in the field of nuclear fuel modelling.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J017574/1","grantId":"EP/J017574/1","fundValue":"92377","fundStart":"2013-02-25","fundEnd":"2014-08-24","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The results of the work are being used to build models to decribe nuclear fuel behaviour and nuclear fuel cladding behaviour.

Damage occurs completely naturally when brittle materials are modelled without needing prior knowledge of crack paths. We are also close to showing that the stress state from peridynamics, in our approach, matches that predicted by standard finite element methods. The research has led to further work on modelling the mechanics of the oxide layer on zirconium fuel cladding. Whilst in its early stages this promises new insights into the way the oxide layer grows and hence ways to improve corrosion resistance leading to longer nuclear fuel lifetimes. This research could be used in a variety of fields as Abaqus is a well used finite element code. We believe the ability to perform peridynamics in Abaqus will be well received by many industrial companies and indeed Rolls-Royce are trialling this method for various applications in their marine business. It has also generated interest from the nuclear fuel vendor Westinghouse in studying fuel failures.
