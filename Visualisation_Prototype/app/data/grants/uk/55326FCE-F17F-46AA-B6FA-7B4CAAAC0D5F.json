We aimed to promote the public understanding of science with regard to disease transmission. To address this, we used informative posters and three interactive activities: (1) Fishing game - feeding success rates of solitary and social animals, in the presence and absence of predators and parasites; (2) Washing Hands - contamination and transmission of germs by unwashed hands; (3) Head Lice - effects of host density and behaviour on disease transmission.</p>\n\n<p>By participating in these games, children learnt about the diversity and biology of parasites, the effects of pathogens on trophic relationships, and the importance of hygiene in everyday life. Furthermore, misunderstandings and misconceptions regarding disease transmission were clarified. All activities proved extremely popular among children and teachers. Teachers' opinion was gathered from evaluation questionnaires, which provided a score of 86 per cent&nbsp;for our activities.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-168-26-0164","grantId":"RES-168-26-0164","fundValue":"396","fundStart":"2008-03-01","fundEnd":"2008-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Joanne  Cable","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
