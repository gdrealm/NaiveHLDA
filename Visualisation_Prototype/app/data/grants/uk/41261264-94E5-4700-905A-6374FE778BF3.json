Certain helminths exploit so-called ‘regulatory cells‘, whose role is to stop the immune system from attacking the body‘s own proteins or from attacking harmless environmental molecules. By expanding the regulatory cells, the parasites not only disable the immune response to themselves, but dampen reactions to other ‘bystander’ proteins such as allergens from house dust mite. In this project, we propose to test whether this effect provides a long-lasting protection against infection, or is lost on treatment to remove parasites; to analyse the cells and molecules involved in inhibiting allergy in the airways, using an animal model for asthma; and to test whether the presence of the parasite can switch potentially damaging allergen-reactive cells into becoming regulatory cells themselves. As a result of this research, we may be able to develop new therapeutic strategies, borrowed from the parasites, to treat allergies and other immune-related diseases.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0501474","grantId":"G0501474","fundValue":"630732","fundStart":"2006-12-11","fundEnd":"2009-12-10","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Richard Michael  Maizels","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
