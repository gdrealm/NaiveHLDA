{"id":"8C27B651-299C-45F8-9D38-5E48DAB50E8E","title":"edible Pickering Emulsion Technology (ePET)","abstractText":"Obesity is placing an increasing burden on health services as well as lowering life quality; the direct cost of obesity to NHS\nis &pound;4.2bn (&pound;16bn indirect costs), forecasted by Foresight to more than double (and to reach &pound;50bn indirect costs) by 2050.\nHealthy foods can help ease this strain, however consumers still expect these to provide a pleasurable eating experience.\nThis requires formulation of food products of &quot;invisibly&quot; reduced fat, identical in taste and &quot;convenience&quot; to their full-fat\ncounterparts. Reduced-fat healthy foods based on double emulsions could achieve just that. Nonetheless uses of double\nemulsion technology in foods are absent due to technological issues in need of break-through innovation. This project\nproposes the design, development and ability to manufacture novel, multifunctional, high value, Pickering-stabilised double\nemulsions for the development of foods specifically formulated with reference to fat reduction.\n\nAt a conceptual level, double emulsions offer enormous potential in the development of healthy foods; namely because\nthey impart an &quot;unperceived&quot; fat reduction in foods but also by &quot;invisibly&quot; carrying and delivering nutrients and bioactives\nwithout compromising on taste. Although &quot;simple&quot; emulsions are well-established systems in many commercial areas\n(including foods), science and technological knowledge are not yet available to allow double emulsions to be commercially\nproduced. To achieve this, innovation is needed to overcome processing and stability issues currently associated with\ndouble emulsions; (a) Processing issues: double emulsions are produced by a 2-step emulsification process. However the\n2nd step can &quot;damage&quot; the primary structure resulting in inconsistent emulsions, and thus double structures that are prone\nto destabilisation (Ostwald ripening). (b) Stability issues: double emulsions are stabilised by at least two low molecular\nweight surfactants. These tend to migrate between the two opposit curved interfaces, eventually leading to the collapse\nof the double structure. This destabilisation process is accelerated by Laplace pressure and chemical potential differences\nbetween the two aqueous phases of the double structure. This collaborative R&amp;D project will address these important\ntechnological challenges; namely the ability to produce double emulsions consistently through a range of processes, to\ndeliver double emulsions with long-term stability and to formulate these complex microstructures with significantly reduced\nemulsifier levels. Evidence from the University of Birmingham suggests that both the processing and stability issues\ncurrently associated with double emulsions can be potentially addressed by the use of Pickering particles. However edible\nstructures that can be used as Pickering particles are currently unavailable. This project will deliver both the formulation\ndesign rules and processing routes in order to manufacture stable edible Pickering particles. The proposed project\nprogramme is carefully designed to quickly recognise potential edible Pickering particles and edible Pickering double\nemulsions &quot;technologies&quot; for use in prototype manufacture, to scale-up the processes to produce these and finally to\nsensorially evaluate the manufactured prototypes and establish whether they can deliver acceptable fat-reduced food\nproducts.\n\nThe project team provides a unique and synergistic offering which will catalyse different thinking, approaches and pave the\nway for innovation, through understanding of surface chemistries, advances in process engineering, measurement and\ncharacterisation. The proposed research program involves the University of Birmingham (UoB), Cargill and Unilever. The technology developed and understanding gained from this collaboration will enable many new applications and foods to\nreach the market, with IPR from this project also expected to be commercially innovative.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J501700/1","grantId":"EP/J501700/1","fundValue":"303651","fundStart":"2012-08-21","fundEnd":"2015-08-20","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Pickering particles could be used to stabilise emulsions for specific applications in foods i.e. reduced oxidative damage of sensitive materials, fat replacement approaches etc Agriculture, Food and Drink Economic","person":"Ian Timothy Norton","coPersons":["Fotis  Spyropoulos","Serafim  Bakalis"],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":" A range of edible Pickering particles have been produced.
