We introduce three innovations in this project. \n\nFirst, we shall investigate statistical models that directly predict key clinical variables so that clinicians can make more informed decisions. This approach is more consistent with guidelines-based prescribing that is used by general practitioners. \n\nSecond, we will develop a way to identify patient groups by using data-driven methods. The approach used is similar to 'market segmentation' used in Business Intelligence. The hypothesis is that patients can be divided into groups not by their disease or stages (as currently practised) but by their patient records that essentially capture their health history. In essence, this method of grouping will naturally group patients with similar treatments including drugs and procedures and similar physiological and pathological characteristics. \n\nThird, as part of the process in predicting the efficacy of kidney function, we will develop a risk model for predicting and detecting Acute Kidney Injury (AKI). This novel model will inform clinicians how likely it is that a patient will suffer from AKI. In short, we propose a unified framework to predict the efficacy of kidney function that also considers the possibility of AKI. This represents a potential advancement in modelling and understanding CKD because the risks of end-stage of CKD and AKI are so far often treated independently. \n\nThe potential advantages of the proposed method include: (1) better tailoring of the method to patient subgroups via data-driven stratification; (2) ability to exploit many more variables that are specific to each patient stratum; (3) ability to predict eGFR and ACR that can be used in conjunction with guidelines-based prescribing; (4) ability to predict Acute Kidney Injury. \n\nThe main outputs of this proposal are: (1) patient-tailored eGFR predictor, (2) patient-tailored ACR predictor, (3) probabilistic AKI estimator, and (4) data-driven patient stratification. By patient tailoring, we understand that the model is capable of considering additional variables that are specific to a patient stratum.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/M023281/1","grantId":"MR/M023281/1","fundValue":"519781","fundStart":"2015-09-01","fundEnd":"2018-08-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Norman  Poh","coPersons":["Tom  Chan","Simon  De Lusignan"],"organisation":"University of Surrey","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
