By definition pain is function of higher brain functions. However, there is now very strong evidence that the majority of clinically relevant pain depends on abnormal primary sensory neurone activity. This is not to say that changes within the brain are not important, but these central changes depend in large measure on abnormal peripheral neurone excitability. The overarching aim of this application is to exploit the knowledge to replace and reduce the use of animal models in pain research. Application of disease modelling using in vitro platforms could potentially be the most effective method of reducing number of animals used in biomedical research. The challenge, particularly in neurological conditions, is to develop relevant models that can recapitulate salient features of a given pathology while preserving, as much as possible, the relationship between cells in a tissue. The use of microfluidic cultures in neuroscience has enabled preserving the connectivity of different neuronal cells while isolating them in their own environment. Our work has shown that microfluidic cultures of pain sensing neurons respond to damage in a similar way, by becoming sensitized, as do in animal models of pain. \nThe aim of this project is to develop a tissue culture platform and associated methodologies that will allow us to investigate the changes in many aspects of pain signalling in exquisite detail in response to injuries that result in chronic pain in animals and humans. This versatile platform that would be based on a number of advanced enabling technologies including microfluidic systems and optogenetic activation of nerve cells, would allow researchers to simulate aspects of nerve injury, in a culture dish and study the way these nerve cells respond to injury and how they change their communication to other neurons through altered synapses. \nPain signalling in humans and mammals in general, is highly integrated and complex, involving the immune system, specialized pain sensing neurons in the periphery and the spinal cord as well as pain processing in the brain. We can evaluate changes in signalling in neurons after injury in relation to immune cells and neuroimmune regulators in order to better understand the interactions between these components of the pain system. Ultimately this platform has to potential to significantly impact use of lesion based animal models in pain research. \nThe current advances in growing human neurons in a dish affords a great opportunities to model neurological diseases in human neurons. Our aim is is extend the use of in vitro platform in neurological research by studying injury responses of human neurons obtained from reprogrammed skin cells in a dish which is common to many neurological disorders. Our project will deliver tools that will impact animal use in pain research and therapeutic development.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NC/M001393/1","grantId":"NC/M001393/1","fundValue":"322645","fundStart":"2015-04-20","fundEnd":"2018-04-19","funder":"NC3Rs","impactText":"","person":"Ramin  Raouf","coPersons":["Stephen Brendan McMahon"],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
