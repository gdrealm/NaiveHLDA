In stark contrast to the software-based programming style of the majority of alternative devices, FPGA normally require the use of hardware design languages and techniques to derive the best implementation.This project proposes a new approach to solve this problem for FPGA DSP. Having shown that simple programmable processors can achieve real-time performance and cost similar to dedicated hardware on FPGA, we propose a project which uses these processors to build FPGA DSP architectures. We propose to develop an ultra-efficient processor architecture and a design methodology to translate a dataflow graph DSP application model into a heterogeneous network of the simple processors, tailored to the application requirements. Further, we will automate this process and apply to real world application demonstrators from our industrial partners Xilinx Inc., the FPGA device market leader and National Instruments, a premier global supplied of FPGA embedded products.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H051155/1","grantId":"EP/H051155/1","fundValue":"450323","fundStart":"2010-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-02-28","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"John Patrick McAllister","coPersons":["Roger  Woods"],"organisation":"Queen's University of Belfast","findingsText":" This project developed a number of highly innovative technologies for realising signal, image and data processing operations on FPGA. Specifically, it developed a very high performance, fine-grained processor architecture which may be combined in very large numbers in order to realise operations in these general application domains. It's finding broke a fundamental barrier in embedded computing: these operations may be realised using these programmable processors with the same performance and cost as fixed-function dedicated hardware units. This is a unique feature of this project. \n\nIn addition, a sophisticated synthesis approach was developed which can automatically develop these multicore architectures from an abstract graphical representation of system behaviour with very low performance overhead. Again, this is the first time this kind of technology has proven viable. There are a number of ways these findings may be exploited, but the primary means is commercial: via licensing, direct spin-out or open source release.
