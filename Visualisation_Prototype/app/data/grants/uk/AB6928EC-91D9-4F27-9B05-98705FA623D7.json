Tracking algorithms are used in a wide variety of domains, such as robotics, vehicular traffic, navigation and communication systems. The main goal is to obtain a record of the trajectory of the moving object(s) over space and time by processing the sensor data. Reliable tracking methods are of crucial importance in many surveillance systems in order to enable human operators to remotely monitor activity across large environments such as: a) transport systems (e.g., railway transportation, airports, urban and motorway road networks, and maritime transportation), b) banks, shopping malls, car parks, and public buildings, c) industrial environments, and d) government establishments (military bases, prisons, strategic infrastructures, radar centres, and hospitals). The problem has different particularities depending on whether data from one or multiple sensors are used. Sensor networks offer many advantages due to the fact that the coming data provide a global picture from different sides. Multiple-sensor systems can provide surveillance coverage across a wide area, ensuring constant object visibility. However, the presence of data from multiple sensors poses many new challenges from theoretical and practical point of view that will be addressed in this project. How to efficiently process the data from many sensors is a significant problem. The data rates associated with collection assets can vary greatly, for instance between a measurement once from each day from a satellite to a measurement every twenty-fifth of a second from a camera. It is impossible to define a single tracking methodology and technique that meet the requirements of all these domains. Advanced tracking algorithms can combine the functionality of existing identification and tracking processes while accounting for any uncertainty if present.Different techniques will be developed in this project outperforming the previously existing techniques in the literature, which will be suitable for on-line implementations. The main interest will be focussed on innovative Bayesian techniques, such as sequential Monte Carlo methods (also called particle filters), Monte Carlo Markov chains and Unscented Kalman filtering, providing efficient approximations to the optimal Bayesian solutions. The Monte Carlo approach is generic, scalable, flexible and has opportunities for parallelisation and distributed implementation. Monte Carlo methods afford natural incorporation of constraints which is difficult or impossible with standard filtering techniques. The algorithms will be implemented in a centralised and distributed way, which is a novel and significant achievement. It can save a lot of energy and reduce the communication load of the supporting sensor networking systems, it will increase its robustness to failure and respectively the reliability of the tracking module. The innovative elements of this proposal rely on the powerful methodology and the focus on very important problems that have been in the scope of interest of scientists and engineers. Problems such as group object tracking and distributed particle filtering represent substantial research challenges which makes this research unique.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E027253/1","grantId":"EP/E027253/1","fundValue":"193155","fundStart":"2007-07-15","fundEnd":"2010-07-14","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The software and algorithms are used in the areas of surveillance and security.

Group and extended object tracking\n\nWe proposed algorithms for group object structure and motion estimation based on random evolving networks combined with sequential Monte Carlo algorithms. The main contributions of our work for group object tracking consist in: i) the developed graphical representation of the groups, for different types of motion, including interactions and taking into account the measurement origin uncertainty, ii) target state estimation with proposed sequential Monte Carlo methods. \n\nEvolutionary graph network-type models for the group structure are proposed. The graph structure can be deterministically estimated or in a probabilistic way with a graph jointly updated with the samples of the particle filter. Then a particle of the developed sequential Monte Carlo filters contains the graph structure of the group which gives significant information. In this graph the connected components correspond to groups of targets. The effectiveness of the proposed techniques is investigated and validated over a challenging urban environment scenario with splitting, merging and crossing of groups. The performance of the approach is also validated over real ground moving target indicator data sets. The proposed approaches successfully estimate the targets states and the group structure graph with reliable performance and accurate tracking. \n\nDistributed Algorithms and Optimisation of the Resources of Sensor Networks\nA fundamental issue in real-world monitoring sensor network systems is the choice of sensors to track local events. Ideally, the sensors work together, in a distributed manner, to achieve a common mission-specific task. We developed a framework for distributed inference based on dynamic clustering and belief propagation in sensor networks with deficient links. We investigated this approach for dynamic clustering of sensor nodes combined with belief propagation for the purposes of object tracking in sensor networks with and without deficient links. The efficiency of our approach is demonstrated over an example of hundreds randomly deployed sensors. Optimisation of the resources of the sensor network was considered, for providing optimal use of the number of sensors, while achieving desirable estimation accuracy and complexity suitable for real time. Dynamic clustering is combined jointly with belief propagation for the purposes of object tracking. \n\n3. Parallelised/ Distributed Particle Filters for Vehicular Traffic Flow Estimation\nLarge traffic network systems require handling huge amounts of data, often distributed over a large geographical region in space and time. Centralised processing is not then the right choice in such cases. Distributed/ parallelised techniques are needed for processing large amounts of data. \n\nWe developed in a parallelised Gaussian Mixture Model filter (GMMF) for vehicular traffic networks aimed to: 1) work with high amounts of heterogenous data (from different sensor modalities), 2) provide robustness in the presence of sparse and missing sensor data, 3) able to incorporate different models in different traffic segments and represent various traffic regimes, 4) able to cope with multimodalities (e.g., due to multimodal measurement likelihood or multimodal state probability density functions). The efficiency of the parallelised GMMF is investigated over traffic flows based on macroscopic modelling and compared with a centralised GMMF. Parallelised Gaussian Sum Particle filters are developed and compared with parallelised particle filters (with efficient proposal functions). The proposed GMM approach is general, it is applicable to systems where the overall state vector can be partitioned into state components (subsets), corresponding to certain geographical regions, such that most of the interactions take place within the subsets. \n\n4. Localisation and Mobility Tracking in Wireless Sensor Networks\nWithin this EPSRC project the problem of localisation in wireless networks (cellular and ad hoc) has been studied and several sequential Monte Carlo techniques are developed: a multiple model particle filter, Rao-Blackweliised and auxiliary particle filters (both for correlated in time measurements and measurements with unknown noise characteristics). \n\n5. Box Particle Filtering\nA new methodology called Box Particle Filtering (BPF) is also theoretically studied and validated over simulated and real data. The BPF is a very promising methodology for complex and high dimensional systems. Box particle filters afford achieving the same estimation accuracy with dozens of particles, whereas generic particle filters needs thousands to achieve the same accuracy. The theoretical methods are published in journal and conference papers. \nThe software for the key developed algorithms is made available as open-source, for everyone to use and can be downloaded from the Mathworks Central web sites:\n\nMatlab Central code for the Box Particle Filter and Bernoulli Box Particle Filter,\n\n* http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/43012-box-particlefilter-\nand-bernoulli-box-particle-filter, 2013.\n* Matlab Central code for group object structure and state estimation with\nevolving networks and Monte Carlo methods, http://www.mathworks.com/\nmatlabcentral/fileexchange/43906, 15 Oct. 2013.\n* Matlab Central code for the Gaussian mixture particle algorithm for dynamic\ncluster tracking, http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/\n44298-the-gaussian-mixture-particle-algorithm-for-dynamic-cluster-tracking,\n14 November 2013.\n* Matlab code for &amp;amp;amp;quot;Mobility Tracking in Cellular\nNetworks Using Particle Filtering&amp;amp;amp;quot;, http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/47428-pf-programs-zip Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Healthcare,Transport","dataset":"gtr"}
