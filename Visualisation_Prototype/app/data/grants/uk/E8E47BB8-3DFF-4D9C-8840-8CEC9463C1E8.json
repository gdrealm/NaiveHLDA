{"id":"E8E47BB8-3DFF-4D9C-8840-8CEC9463C1E8","title":"Structural analysis of the interaction networks","abstractText":"The objective of this project is to develop an integrated understanding of the metabolic and genetic network that controls the transition from growth to glucose starvation in the model bacterium, Bacillus subtilis. In addition to serving as a model system, B. subtilis is an industrial workhorse for 'white biotechnology' since it serves is a primary producer of technical enzymes and other products (e.g. vitamins, antibiotics, flavour enhancers and biochemicals). The transition from growth to growth limitation is a fundamental ecophysiological response and is studied by academic researchers as a model for environmental signal processing and integration. Understanding this transition is also pivotal for industrial fermentations of Bacillus that occur predominantly under nutrient limitation. Our approach is to integrate biological data with mathematical models of the networks that regulate the transition from growth to starvation. The approach starts with quantitative monitoring of defined genetic and environmental perturbations under standardized growth conditions. These data are used for mathematical modelling of regulatory processes. As the programme develops, gaps in our understanding will be revealed by the failure of structural, genome-wide network analyses to describe the biological data. Our concept is to continuously probe model and data consistency in clearly defined (sub)projects, each involving an experimental and a modelling partner. The pivotal element is a model-driven experimental design, where model-based hypotheses are tested through targeted measurements of critical variables. Facilitated through standardized nomenclature, model formats, and defined input/output signals, modular mathematical models are then integrated into a consistent systems representation. In summary, the project will provide convincing evidence that close interactions between experimental and computational scientists on a well advanced model organism can significantly advance our quantitative understanding of, and eventually our ability to control, the highly dynamic and complex regulatory processes in microbes.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F003404/1","grantId":"BB/F003404/1","fundValue":"343162","fundStart":"2007-08-01","fundEnd":"2011-01-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The PI and one of the research staff employed on the SysMo project in Newcastle, Dr Lorraine Hewitt, spent 10 days in the June of 2010 at the 350th Anniversary Celebrations of the Royal Society as standholders with the Diamond synchrotron source. The exhibition as the South Bank Centre was visited first by a convocation of FRSs, plus members of the Royal Family and other dignitaries. After these private celebrations, the exhibition was opened to the public, and ~40,000 visitors were estimated to have visited the exhibition. In our part of the stand, we explained to visitors how we the 3D information gleaned from protein structure can be used for societal gain. The visitors to the stand included scientists, scientifically aware adults and other adults with no scientific training, school children of all ages with their teachers. Other than talking to people face to face, the stand had a short video running on a loop that explained the process of solving structures by crystallography placed into context with &quot;real&quot; examples from our lab. Some hands-on plastic models of protein structure made by rapid prototyping were also used as part of the visual aids. The PI was interviewed for 2 on-line popular science webcasts that were broadcast around the time of the exhibition.

By exploiting structural similarity to other enzymes, we constructed a structural model for the RNase J1:RNA complex, revealing stacking interactions with conserved aromatic side-chains, and a molecular basis for the observed substrate specificity. \n\nRNase J1 cannot accept a 5â€™ tri-phosphorylated nucleotide as a substrate. In a joint project with the Stulke lab in the BACELL SYSMO consortium, the pyrophosphatase responsible for this step has been identified, characterised biochemically and its structure solved by X-ray crystallography, revealing the key amino acids for catalysis. \n\nPairwise interactions of the proteins in the degradosome were assessed. The tightest interaction measured is between enolase and phosphofructokinase, with an equilibirum disassociation constant of a little under micromolar. This observation indicates the exciting potential for substrate channeling between these glycolytic enzymes via the common intermediate, phosphoglycerate mutase. This project was one of the first systems biology awards made by the BBSRC. In hindsight, it was premature to consider this approach and I would thus be more circumspect about engaging in these projects without some demonstration that the putative complexes actually existed.
