Under the current award, the initial two of a projected series of four volumes will be produced, and significant progress made towards the preparation of the final two. The two volumes in question will be based in part on texts which Bentham himself printed, and in part on original manuscripts deposited in University College London Library and the Bibliotheque Publique et Universitaire, Geneva. Each volume will contain an editorial introduction, full annotation, and comprehensive name and subject indexes, and will be published under the prestigious Clarendon Press imprint of Oxford University Press.</p> \n<p>Jeremy Bentham (1748–1832), an outstanding figure in our intellectual heritage, was at the heart of the movement known as philosophic radicalism which emerged in the early nineteenth century. The philosophic radicals included such major economists as James Mill, David Ricardo, and John Stuart Mill, who were all profoundly influenced by Bentham. The new edition will make possible a proper understanding not only of Bentham’s economic thought, but of the emergence of the discipline of economics itself.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E018882/1","grantId":"ES/E018882/1","fundValue":"677754","fundStart":"2007-09-01","fundEnd":"2012-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Thomas Philip Schofield","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
