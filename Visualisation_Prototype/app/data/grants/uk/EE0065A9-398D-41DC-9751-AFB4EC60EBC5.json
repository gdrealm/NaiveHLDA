{"id":"EE0065A9-398D-41DC-9751-AFB4EC60EBC5","title":"Programme Coordinator - Census Programme 2006-11","abstractText":"<p>This award represents the continuation of the Programme Coordinator’s role from the successful previous round of the ESRC/JISC Census Programme. The programme provides census data access and expert user support to users in UK Higher and Further Education through a series of data support units, including an online registration service. Holdings include all principal census outputs from 1971-2001 in addition to key related datasets such as postcode directories and census-derived products. With the exception of longitudinal and some microdata samples, these datasets are all available online through specialist web services. New features of the 2006-11 programme will include enhancements to the existing services, integration of the new Scottish Longitudinal Study and the creation of a new integrated Census Portal, to provide searchable metadata and a single point of access to all programme services and relevant external resources. The coordinator’s role involves negotiation with the UK census agencies on matters of data acquisition and dissemination for academic use, representation of the academic sector on census advisory panels and consultations, promotion of the programme’s services and overall coordination and management of the work of the data support units.

The award ensured the delivery of data infrastructure to higher education and research and collaborations with other sectors, particularly local government and commercial organizations who are also major users of census data.

The programme comprised online and secure laboratory data access services, user support and training and small research and development awards. The co-ordination of this award involved extensive collaboration with other sectors in order to influence the specification and delivery of 2011 census data by the UK statistical organizations. The programme developed a range of software tools, training events and materials (attended by both academic and non-academic researchers) and helped to influence census output decisions, many of which are reflected in 2011 census data now published under an Open Government Licence and available to all sectors. The software tools and training materials developed by the Census Programme have contributed to the new ESRC UK Data Service and underpin an enormous range of academic work based on 2001 census datasets. Most of the data and services directly provided by the programme were specifically restricted to use by the UK academic community by data licensing conditions.
