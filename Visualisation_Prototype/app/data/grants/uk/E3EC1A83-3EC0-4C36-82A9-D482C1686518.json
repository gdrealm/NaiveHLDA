{"id":"E3EC1A83-3EC0-4C36-82A9-D482C1686518","title":"Succinic Esters from Renewable Feedstocks (SERF)","abstractText":"This proposal is based on the utilisation of a low cost lignocellulosic feedstock for the production of specific target C3 and C4 platform chemicals for conversion to industrial feedstocks including PLA, polyols and succinic esters. The target feedstock is high sugar/ low lignin grass genotypes developed by IGER. Complementary expertise at The BioComposites Centre and IGER will explore chemical/ mechanical fractionation processes in combinations with novel enzyme and micro-organism treatments to develop the platform chemicals for conversion to a range of lactate, succinate and polyol based feedstocks. World class research expertise has brought together support from Frontier, Boots, Solvay, Fuchs and Industrial Co-polymers. This project will give the UK a significant advantage in affordable bioderived molecules for applications in coatings, plastics and cosmetics.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=DT/E010679/1","grantId":"DT/E010679/1","fundValue":"203489","fundStart":"2007-06-01","fundEnd":"2010-11-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Robert Morus  Elias","coPersons":["Paul  Fowler"],"organisation":"Bangor University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
