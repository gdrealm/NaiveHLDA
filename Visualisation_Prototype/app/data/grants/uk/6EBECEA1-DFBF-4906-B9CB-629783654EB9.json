It has the potential to make software design more efficient and improve the quality of the final software product. It works according to the following steps: 1) an abstract specification of software is written by a designer; 2) a platform (consisting of, for example, middleware and programming language) is chosen to implement the specification; 3) a transformation function is applied to the specification to produce a specification of the software that includes relevant decisions about how the software is to be implemented within the platform; 4) this design is implemented. Thus, the designer focuses their effort on producing a good abstract specification, while transformations enable automated design decisions for any supported platform.The approach is powerful, useful and dangerous. Because MDA is essentially an informal approach, it does not guarantee correct model transformations. This makes it dangerous. In fact, if model transformations are incorrect, the MDA process results in software of a drastically lower quality than that produced by traditional software development.This proposal is in request of a travel grant to support international collaboration on the important question of how to make MDA safer through integration with formal methods. The focus will be on examining how higherorder type theory might be used to formalize a notion of correct model transformation and to investigate proofsas- programs techniques for the synthesis of correct transformations.The grant will enable the investigator to 1) conduct international collaborative research on this topic and 2) develop a network of researchers who are interested in improving MDA through formal methods. It is intended that the results of the grant will serve as a foundation for a larger research grant, possibly in collaboration with some of the groups visited.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E010806/1","grantId":"EP/E010806/1","fundValue":"13008","fundStart":"2006-06-16","fundEnd":"2008-06-15","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Iman Hafiz Poernomo","coPersons":[],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
