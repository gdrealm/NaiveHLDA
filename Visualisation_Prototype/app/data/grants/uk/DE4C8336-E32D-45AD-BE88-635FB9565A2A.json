{"id":"DE4C8336-E32D-45AD-BE88-635FB9565A2A","title":"The Geography of Commercial Design: A Comparison of London and the Regions","abstractText":"<p>This project focuses upon the geography of commercial design agencies in the UK.&nbsp;Although there has been much research into the cultural and creative industries in recent years, there has been little research on the geography of design.&nbsp;This neglect of one of the UK's internationally outstanding industries is regrettable, since it has left unanswered an issue of crucial importance for the economy: how effective are existing regional structures in enhancing the competitiveness of design industries?&nbsp;In particular, is the overwhelming concentration of design agencies in London and the South East optimal in terms of ensuring creative dynamism in design? The project compares the strategies, organisation and practices of design agencies in London with those of design firms in other cities. It examines the development of design centres in selected cities with the aim of identifying the main constraints on their expansion and development. It aims to understand the relationships between the various types of knowledge used by design consultancies, their location, networks and their market competitiveness.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-0083","grantId":"RES-062-23-0083","fundValue":"250905","fundStart":"2006-12-01","fundEnd":"2008-11-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter John Sunley","coPersons":["Suzanne Mary Reimer","Steven Paul Pinch"],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
