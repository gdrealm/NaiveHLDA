Since 2010, when the Greek government and IMF/EU/ECB agreed on the largest loan ever received by a single country, Greece has seen sweeping transformations in the character of its polity and state functions. The Greek version of the crisis has produced a rupture in the modus operandi of the state in question and in its relationship with its citizenry. The main axis of this rupture is the systemic challenge and reconfiguration of the category 'public' - which of course includes public spaces. This research focuses on the newly emerging public socialities in reference to public urban spaces. The idea of emphasizing spontaneous and unspontaneous socio-spatial practices, public urban materialities and spatialities in the capital city of Greece appears as an ideal way in which to study the wide variety of the social consequences of the financial crisis.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K001663/1","grantId":"ES/K001663/1","fundValue":"165042","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-05-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  Since the commencement of The City At a Time Crisis (henceforth TCATC), in 2012 public discourse and legal action concerning racially-motivated attacks in Greece has shifted tremendously: by now, a number of individuals have been charged for inciting racial hatred (including, for the first time in the country's history, Members of Parliament), while the Parliamen voted in the country's first set of laws specifically concerning racist crimes. TCATC played a key role in highlighting issues of racially motivated attacks in Athens' public spaces, helping to massively shift public attitude toward them. Knowledge exchange with key stakeholders and building capacity through the deployment of a crowd-sourced mapping tool was key in maximising its impact. Having since enjoyed formidable exposure in international media, including Russia Today and The Guardian, the TCATC project has achieved both a broad and targeted impact in the international public sphere. \n\nGiven the pertinence of the research topic to current public debates concerning the financial crisis, and the key position of Greece within these, one of the three main objectives of TCATC has been the widespread dissemination and targeting of the research findings in shaping international debates. For this reason, the project incorporated dissemination in its original budgeting, employing an in-house Technical Assistand solely for the purpose of dissemination, while also establishing partnerships with private sector practitioners, including an award-winning filmmaker. The principles guiding the project's pathway to impact are as follows: A participatory approach, producing outputs that take into account knowledge exchange with potential research users. Dynamic and constant flow of research outputs via weekly updates on the project website. Free and open access to key research outputs through a Creative Commons (CC) license. Widespread dissemination of outputs and datasets to key groups, organisations and media/social media by combining captivating interactive visual elements and video with more in-depth analysis. The participatory approach has been facilitated by the establishment of response groups comprising of potential research users and stakeholders, involving them in the design, execution and presentation stages of the research. In the early project stages, potential users and stakeholders were approached and a process of systematic knowledge exchange was initiated aiming toward a more participatory development of the project. Such users and stakeholders included well-established Athens-based NGOs (such as the Greek Council for Refugees, Solidarity for All, Doctors of the World); major international organisations (such as the UNHCR and the OECD); members of Athens' Municipal Council (Eleni Portaliou); representatives of migrant communities and support organisations in the city (such as the Network for Migrant Rights, the Pakistani Community Association and the Afghan Community Association) and key professional associations (including the Merchants' Association of Athens). A common issue raised by almost every stakeholder in the meetings concerned the increase of racist violence in the city's public spaces. Through the research, it became evident that the actual extent of racist violence had been vastly underestimated in official discourse and in existent academic research alike. Up to that point, no official statistics were compiled regarding racially motivated crimes in Greece, while many of the victims were undocumented and therefore unable to report these crimes to the police. The Racist Violence Recording Network, an independent body of NGOs mediated by the UNHCR, had been gathering its own data, but faced seemingly insurmountable challenges in gathering and verifying such information. In addition, the network's reports were published bi-annually, which effectively meant there was no regularly updated public record of these attacks. The mapping project was conceived in order to address these issues. From the date when it commenced, TCATC launched an interactive website updated on a weekly basis since - thereby ensuring a regular audience and establishing itself as a source of reliable, scholarly knowledge that is publicly available, open and free to use. In this way, when the map was launched in April 2013, it met an already existent audience and was immediately catapulted to the centre of ongoing international debates about the social and political future of Greece. Datasets and texts from the website have been reproduced and translated from English into five languages (Greek, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese and French) thereby reaching an even more international audience. The project website has had a visitor count in excess of 130,000, within a period of just over twelve months. The number increases dramatically if the reproduction of TCATC content in other media outlets is taken into account. Beyond scholarly analysis, the website has been updated weekly to offer photographic and video material from the field, all offered under the same creative commons license and more accessible to a wider audience of academics and non-academics alike. Since its launch, the interactive map documenting racist attacks has been instrumental in re-framing debates and behaviors on the question of migration in Athens and Greece overall. NGOs, international and local organizations working on migration have all been actively using the online interactive map in their everyday work as an up-to-date reference, an advocacy tool and as a means to engage in debates. As extreme-right violence increased in late summer of 2013, resulting in the arrest of the leadership of the Golden Dawn party, the use of the map spiked overnight, even momentarily causing a server overload. The in-house TA instantly migrated the map to dedicated SSD servers where it has since been able to accommodate the dramatic increase in traffic caused by the growth of the map's popularity per se, as well as rapid social and political developments in the country overall: in September 2013 alone, the map was visited by over 50,000 unique users. Since the end of the TCATC project (in May 2014), it is already evident that its multimedia outputs and datasets - and the map of racist attacks in particular - hold a value and relevance that extends far beyond this end date.

The project findings may be summarised as follows:\n\nCurtailing of Political Activism\nWe found a considerable shrinkage in the expression of political discourse in Athens' public spaces, with an apparently focused attempt by the country's authorities to curtail public speech and the right to protest. This attempt included, for example, an unprecedented operation to evict some of Athens' longest-standing social centres, which was studied extensively and in depth by TCATC. \nDiscriminatory Control of Public Space\nIn addition, TCATC found that the Greek police placed considerable weight on a more rigid control of the city's public spaces, applying policies of racial and ethnic discrimination. Police operation &quot;Xenios Zeus&quot;, which commenced in August 2012, saw the detention of over 84,000 migrants within its first seven months alone. The Greek government has been repeatedly criticized by international human rights organisation and media for a racist and xenophobic stance against migrants. Several of these reports referenced and quoted the work of TCATC. \nIncrease in Racist Attacks \nTCATC recorded and proved a tremendous increase in racially motivated physical attacks. The scale and geographical spread of these attacks was recorded through TCATC's digital &quot;racist attacks map&quot;, which was covered extensively in national and international media alike (including The Guardian and Al Jazeera) and international organisations (including UNHCR and AI), winning considerable praise for raising an extremely serious social issue outside academia - and achieving very substantial impact as a result. \nSocial Alienation\nThe TCATC project found that the on-going financial crisis has had formidable impact on everyday interaction between the city's dwellers, radically altering the urban experience for many in return. Increasing tendencies of social alienation were ethnographically recorded through daily interaction within the contexts of mass transport, the streets and the squares of the city of Athens. \nInfrastructural Decay\nFinally, the city is witnessing both a privatisation of its public land stock and considerable deterioration in its physical infrastructure and infrastructural flows as direct outcomes of privatisation and public disinvestment led by the crisis. The transportation links and flows of the Greek capital have been reduced considerably, with areas of lower- and middle-income taking the heaviest toll. In addition, the flows of the city's materialities (e.g. construction, energy, waste) have been slowed down - often brought to a halt - due to general impoverishment, and wage and staff cuts to key public worker sectors.\n\nFuture research plans to study the militarisation, privatisation and tighter policing of Athens, and explore the solidarity movements that have emerged as grassroots responses to these economic and structural conditions. The TCATC findings have already been reported and analysed via the weekly updates on the project's website; the fifteen published essays; six documentary films and the project's first book 'Crisis-scapes: Athens and Beyond'. \nCITY's annual event of 2014 will be dedicated to TCATC, screening our final documentary film 'Future Suspended' and hosting talks by the research team in London. Furthermore the forthcoming issue of the journal CITY is the result of the end of the project conference in Athens. In addition to over ten papers given already to various universities (e.g. Princeton, CUNY, LSE, Oxford) the grant-holder is the key-note speaker in the annual conference of CASA (Prague). From September to December 2014 he is invited to give papers to the Universities of Oxford, Belfast, Hamburg, London and Sussex. Papers will be presented at the next EASA, AAA, ASA and AAG meetings, while an extra book is prepared to be submitted to a publisher by the end of 2014. The public screenings of the project's documentary (including NYC, London, Athens) were sold out, so more screening have been scheduled. \nAll the TCATC digital infrastructure and outputs are still online with free access under CC licence, rather than copyright, maximizing dissemination. The webpage has circa 100,000 views already; the films have another 120,000 online views and the first book has over 10,000 downloads while hardcopies are sold-out. Simultaneously the project has been featured by media outlets such as the Guardian and Al Jazeera. The grant holder has been invited to speak to high profile events such as the World Political Forum in Istanbul in October 2014. \n\nTCATC organised regular meetings with end-users in Athens (including NGOs, communities of migrants and activists) and abroad (Project for Public Spaces, NYC). Thus end-users were incorporated into the development of the project - paving the way for the exploitation of these findings. \n\nTCATC's outcomes have also already raised awareness of the social and societal deterioration caused by the crisis - including financial impoverishment, infrastructural poverty and deterioration in the urban environment, everyday social relationships and mental health of the population. It is anticipated, for this reason, that the project outcomes will be used in the future by NGO's and other third-sector organisations working on these issues.\n\nTCATC's map of racist attacks holds one of the greatest potential for societal impact in the future: key end-users, including migrant communities in Athens, have already contributed to the mapping and it is anticipated to be used as a tool facilitating future legal campaigns against racist violence and/or police negligence - as well as public awareness campaigns.\n\nPartly due to the dissemination of the project's findings Greek authorities have changed their attitude towards racist crimes, having for the first time explicit antiracist laws being passed in Greece. TCATC has also been instrumental in recasting the international and public reputation of the Greek neo-Nazi party, Golden Dawn.\n\nThe project has highlighted the relationships between austerity, poverty, racism, extremism and urban infrastructural transformations. These findings have the potential to set an agenda for our understanding of the economic crisis and its ramifications not only in Greece, but also across other nations of Europe - particularly the so-called 'PIGS' nations.
