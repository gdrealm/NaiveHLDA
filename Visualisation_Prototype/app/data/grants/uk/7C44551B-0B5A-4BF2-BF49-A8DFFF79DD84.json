The review mapped key academic texts across 9 disciplines and fields since the 1960s. It reviewed the ways in which key conceptualizations appeared in empirical articles within these fields and disciplines and also appeared within government, NGO and voluntary sector websites, where community was an explicit aspect of the organisation's brief. The review showed that while there is a sophisticated history of debate and investigation within a few key disciplines, there has been a paucity of concepts used within empirical research, applied fields and policy websites. The impact of this is to make community into a 'spray-on term', in which there is little reference to concepts but in which implicit meanings emphasize the significance of community as an object and downplay the importance of social relations and experience. The implications of this for research, policy and practice are profound: we badly need research which allows community as action to be conceptualized in ways which understand and thus support action by community members, central to the localism agenda.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/J500050/1","grantId":"AH/J500050/1","fundValue":"32164","fundStart":"2011-03-01","fundEnd":"2011-09-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"V  Walkerdine","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
