Most living organisms, from animals to plants reproduce sexually. Briefly, during meiosis the chromosomes are copied, followed by 2 successive chromosome divisions. During the pathway to the first division the pairs of chromosomes find each other and are held together by exchanging part of their chromosomes with their partner, a process known as recombination, until the first division where they are separated. The second division is similar to mitosis. There are many outstanding questions in meiosis for example how do the chromosomes manage to pair and recombine? We think that the telomeres are important in early meiosis to move the chromosomes around until they are closely aligned with their partner. This grant proposal is concerned with understanding more about the organisation and pairing of the telomeric regions in meiosis as well as developing an imaging system to help elucidate the dynamics of telomere behaviour using the model plant, Arabidopsis. There are a number of advantages of using this model plant; for example it only has 5 pairs of chromosomes, its chromosomes have been sequenced and mutants affecting the progression of meiosis and telomere maintenance have been identified. We will use these significant advantages offered by Arabidopsis, in particular that there are only 5 pairs of chromosomes, to elucidate these fundamental aspects of telomere biology. Understanding of the meiotic process has been greatly advanced by biochemical, cytological and genetic analyses of the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and increasingly in a number of other model organisms. Arabidopsis is recognised as an excellent system for analysis of plant meiosis, and one of the aims of the current research is to understand whether and to what extent meiotic processes and controls are conserved across both plants and animals. Inclusion of a plant model is very important, particularly if we are to transfer our knowledge to crop species and traits related to their fertility. It is likely to provide support for key general principles; because meiosis is a universal process, information regarding telomere behaviour in plants is likely to be relevant to general telomere biology and therefore reproduction and telomere function in humans.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F002858/1","grantId":"BB/F002858/1","fundValue":"334365","fundStart":"2008-01-01","fundEnd":"2011-02-28","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Susan  Armstrong","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":" Factors directing telomere dynamics in Arabidopsis\n\nTo characterise the role of the telomeres in meiosis we investigated the movement of the telomeres, the relationship between telomere pairing and loading of recombination proteins and SC related proteins. We investigated the effect of distrupting the microtubules, cytoskeleton components and possible intranuclear protein networks. (Roberts et al (2009)\n\nOne of the goals in biomedical science is the investigation of sub cellular structures in a living environment. Existing methods inevitably involve damage and usually lead to the death of the cell. The recent development of multiphoton microscpoes has meant that it is possible folow the progressuiion of meiosis in living cells without killing the cell. The ultrafast nature of the process minimises the amount of heat deposited in the surrounding area. As a result cytoplasm directly adjacent to the processed area remains unaffected. We hae used this technology to disrupt both the cell membrane and telomeres to investigate whether this will prevent progression of meiosis. We have also made some preliminsry investigastions for investigating the temporal aspects of telomere pairing relative to loading of the components of the SC and those proteins associated with recombination. ( varas et al 2011) \n\nTelomere binding proteins\nIn mammals a protein complex that shapes and protect the telomeres has been identified, and named as 'shelterin'. The complex is thought to comprise of 6 proteins, TRF1, TRF2, TIN2, Rap-1, TPP1 and POT1. \n\nPlant telomere proteins\nWe have identified some Arabidopsis telomere binding proteins and have characterised them. e.g.Pot1 and At Pot 2. Arabidopsis genes At2g05210 and At5g06310 showed strong similarity with the N-terminal Telo_bind_N domain, and with the corresponding regions in S. pombe and human Pot1 proteins. The Arabidopsis genes were designated AtPot1 andAtPot2, respectively .We have failed to find any T DNA insertion lines for Pot-1 (Roberts 2010).\nlaboratory.
