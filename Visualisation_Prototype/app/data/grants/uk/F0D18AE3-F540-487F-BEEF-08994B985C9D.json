The Chinese innovation system has its weaknesses but excels at the rapid mobilisation of resources. It is now at an early stage in the most ambitious programme of research investment since John F Kennedy embarked on the moon race.</p>\n\n<p>Against this backdrop, policymakers in Europe and the US are increasingly concerned about the quality of research links with China. Some regard China's growing capabilities as a threat to competitiveness. But the rise of China also creates new opportunities for collaboration. </p>\n\n<p>As China’s innovation capabilities grow, a central question is whether techno-nationalism will gather momentum, or whether the impulse towards global collaboration will prove stronger. Recent analysis of cosmopolitanism offers useful resources to these debates. A 'cosmopolitan vision' holds the promise of innovation in pursuit of global goods (for example, environmental protection and poverty reduction) whilst still valuing the distinctiveness of national cultures.&nbsp; </p>\n\n<p>This project explores the relationship between innovation, ethics, governance and sustainability within UK-China collaborative research networks. Through interviews and case studies, it will look in detail at three domains of innovation: agriculture, energy and mobility. The project runs for thirty months, beginning in July 2007.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E019498/1","grantId":"ES/E019498/1","fundValue":"272669","fundStart":"2007-07-01","fundEnd":"2010-04-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"James  WILSDON","coPersons":["John  Urry","Brian  Wynne"],"organisation":"Lancaster University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
