{"id":"6F541F0A-2C5A-49BB-BA1E-865B96A979A3","title":"MOLECULAR GENETICS OF BIPOLAR AFFECTIVE DISORDER","abstractText":"The research project aims to contribute to the understanding of the basic genetic causes of bipolar disorder and genetically related unipolar disorder. These disorders are strongly associated with alcoholism and other drugs of abuse. Therefore the understanding of the genetic cases of bipolar and related unipolar affective disorders will also contribute to the understanding of one of the many causes of alcoholism. The finding of genes increasing susceptibility to bipolar disorder is not an academic exercise because the science can point to new approaches for designing drugs for depression and mania. Preventive measures are also possible once it is possible to understand the underlying causes.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1000708","grantId":"G1000708","fundValue":"902673","fundStart":"2011-03-01","fundEnd":"2016-08-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Andrew  McQuillinHugh Malcolm  Gurling","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
