This ability has many advantages, including allowing identification of similar others. </p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately a negative side effect is a pervasive tendency for people to favour their in-group over out-groups, which can result in a breakdown in relations between groups. One possible means to counter prejudice is through the exposure to combined social categories. This requires little effort on behalf of the perceiver as long as the combined categories are congruent in nature, (eg 'female midwife') but on encountering a 'male midwife', the social perceiver may experience difficulty. Perceivers initiate an effortful process of inconsistency resolution, resulting in 'emergent attributes' - attributes not ascribed to the constituent categories, but which are to the combination. These attributes 'explain away' the constituent conflict. </p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, pilot work has shown that this has a positive side effect - a more positive attitude towards the target person. This would be particularly useful as a means to reduce prejudice when the combination consists of a stigmatised social category, for example 'black' and a more positively valenced category, for example, 'doctor', whereby stereotyping is replaced with a view of this person as an individual. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-1652","grantId":"RES-062-23-1652","fundValue":"162164","fundStart":"2009-03-23","fundEnd":"2011-03-22","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Russell Robert Hutter","coPersons":["Rhiannon Nia Turner"],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
