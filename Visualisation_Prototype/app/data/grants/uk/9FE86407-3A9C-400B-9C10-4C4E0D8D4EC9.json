{"id":"9FE86407-3A9C-400B-9C10-4C4E0D8D4EC9","title":"Skills and knowledge for sustainable communities: initiative coordination","abstractText":"This research coordinates eleven projects under the special Targeted Initiative linking ideas, knowledge and thinking to the development of skills and practices in the field of sustainable communities. It is jointly funded by the ESRC and the Academy for Sustainable Communities, and focuses on how generic skills, as outlined in the Egan review, and specific skills within communities can be fostered more effectively. By drawing on the evidence from each local project, the coordinating role here is to explore cross-cutting themes, and to locate the debates on skills and knowledge within international contexts. Specific emphasis will be given to revisiting the range of ‘generic’ skills proposed under the Egan Review, identifying how local skills can be enhanced, and facilitating institutional learning and change management. Further, the research will explore different arenas of learning, and add to understanding on the situational geographies and contexts within which skills for sustainability are located.\n<br />\n<br />The research will offer advice to policy and practice communities on how to foster skills towards building sustainable communities, and to engage with academic debates over sustainable behaviour, community development and skill acquisition.\n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-182-34-0001","grantId":"RES-182-34-0001","fundValue":"80005","fundStart":"2008-02-01","fundEnd":"2009-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Robert  Rogerson","coPersons":["Anne Elizabeth Green","Cecilia  Wong"],"organisation":"University of Strathclyde","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
