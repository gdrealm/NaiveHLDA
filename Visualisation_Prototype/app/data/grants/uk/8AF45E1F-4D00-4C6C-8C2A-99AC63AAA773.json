{"id":"8AF45E1F-4D00-4C6C-8C2A-99AC63AAA773","title":"Role of Aspergillus fumigatus gene clusters in mammalian niche-adaptation","abstractText":"A small number of fungi are able to cause infection in humans. Among them, the soil-dwelling fungus Aspergillus fumigatus is a serious threat to human health. Aspergillus fumigatus spores are extremely small and remain airborne for long periods of time. If inhaled by humans with defective or deficient immunity they can germinate and grow within the lung, causing invasive infection which is often fatal. It is currently unknown why Aspergillus fumigatus is able to cause human disease whereas closely related fungal species are not. The Aspergillus fumigatus genome has been sequenced and comparisons to genomes of non-pathogenic relatives identify the greatest differences, at the level of DNA sequence, at the ends of chromosomes, which are known as telomeres. We previously used a technique called microarray analysis to record gene activity, simultaneously from every Aspergillus fumigatus gene, in an attempt to identify genes involved in establishing mammalian infection. There were two surprising features of the resulting dataset. Firstly, the vast majority of active genes were located at the telomeres of genes. Secondly we identified many clusters of neighbouring genes which seem to be co-regulated. Recently, gene clusters have been identified in other disease-causing fungi, such as those infecting plants, and have been implicated in infection. We therefore wish to investigate the function of the Aspergillus gene clusters to determine whether, and how, they are involved in establshing disease. Aspergillus fumigatus may have developed the ability to colonise the human lung as a result of evolving to withstand stresses in the soil environment. We therefore plan to investigate the process of adaptation to the mammalian lung environment to identify factors important for establishing infection. The process of adapting to the stresses of varying habitats is known as niche-adaptation.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/G009619/1","grantId":"BB/G009619/1","fundValue":"425569","fundStart":"2009-03-01","fundEnd":"2012-03-15","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Elaine  Bignell","coPersons":["Sarah Anne Butcher"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":" Genome-wide temporal profiling of Aspergillus fumigatus gene expression was performed during early infection in two murine models of infection, and in growth-matched laboratory cultured germlings. The analysis identified genes both up- and down-regulated in response to the host niche, relative to laboratory culture. The data have been complied into a compendium of A. fumigatus gene expression and, upon publication, will represent the only extant source of data derived from host-infecting A. fumigatus. \n\n\n\nThe compendium will be accessible via the Bignell laboratory home-page and will permit the research community to interrogate, simultaneously, data derived from more than 200 microarrays to study the expression profile of their favourite gene(s). The compendium is expected to go live from the end of May 2012, and will be accompanied by a publication (to be submitted to BMC Genomics) which documents the relevant experimentation and key findings.\n\n\n\nA methodology for deletion of A. fumigatus gene clusters, utilising bacterial artificial chromosome recombineering was developed. The entire pseurotin biosynthetic gene cluster was replaced with a single dominant selectable marker conferring resistance to hygromycin. Mutants deficient in pseurotin biosynthesis were found to have reduced virulence in murine models of pulmonary aspergillosis, thereby identifying a second A. fumigatus secondary metabolite which impacts host defence against Aspergillus infection. The study highlights potential biomarkers of Aspergillus infection and might inform the design of new diagnostic strategies This research highlights gene functions which are employed by the fungus during infection and will inform the development of novel antifungal therapies Healthcare","dataset":"gtr"}
