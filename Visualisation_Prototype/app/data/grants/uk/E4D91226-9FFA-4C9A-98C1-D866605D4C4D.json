This bacterium, called Neisseria meningitidis, lives in the human nose and throat as its sole habitat. Here it is exposed to all sorts of stresses, one of the most important of which is a toxic radical compound called nitric oxide. The microbe has special mechanisms to remove this nitric oxide, and thus protect itself from being killed. What we are interested in here is how the organism detects this radical and how it then makes its response. We have found evidence for a particular protein which is part of the Neisseria meningitidis bacterial cell that binds to the nitric oxide and directs the cell to make another protein that causes the breakdown of the nitric oxide. Here we intend to try to find out how this process works. The experiments we are proposing to do will allow us to ask a fundamental question about the way cells are organised: is the response of the cell to the environmental cue nitric oxide a simple linear process in which a single protein carries out the physiologically relevant detection and response to nitric oxide, or is the cell acting in a more complex way in which multiple regulators are affected by nitric oxide, and the final cell behaviour emerges from the action of a complex network of these regulatory events. We intend to investigate the biological phenomenon of nitric oxide regulation by investigating the properties of the candidate nitric oxide responsive regulators as proteins, and investigating how these proteins interact with DNA in the test tube. Furthermore, we will use genetic approaches to investigate the roles of these proteins in responding to nitric oxide in the whole cell using specific gene probes and global approaches that allow us to investigate the expression of all of the N. meningitidis genes simultaneously.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F000952/1","grantId":"BB/F000952/1","fundValue":"330110","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"James William Moir","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of York","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
