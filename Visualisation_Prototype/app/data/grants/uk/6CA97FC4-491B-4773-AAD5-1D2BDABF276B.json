One process that can potentially unite these patterns is the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are highly reactive molecules that damage a range of other molecules and cellular structures. Since oxidative damage increases with age, senescence results from the damage generated by accumulating ROS levels. The primary source of damage occurs when ROS leak from the mitochondria during cellular metabolism. Thus, the typically higher metabolic rate (and ROS production) of males may explain their increased rate of senescence and reduced longevity relative to females. Moreover, because mitochondrial function is more efficient with lower amounts of energy, CR may extend lifespan by reducing ROS leakage. Our proposed research will examine the effect of CR on sex differences in reproductive effort, cellular damage by ROS and rates of ageing in the native Australian field cricket, Teleogryllus commodus. We will conduct fieldwork in Australia on six geographically isolated wild cricket populations to examine the relationship between reproductive effort, oxidative stress and ageing in the sexes. We already have compelling evidence that these populations differ genetically in how quickly they age and their reproductive effort and that these variables negatively related in both sexes. We then build on this field study by conducting controlled feeding experiments in the laboratory, using specialised diets that differ in caloric content but not nutrition, to examine how CR influences the relationship between reproductive effort, oxidative stress and ageing. Finally, we will supplement a standardized diet with antioxidants (vitamin A &amp; E, carotenoids) to determine if these molecules are able reduce cellular damage by ROS and therefore rates of ageing.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/G00949X/1","grantId":"NE/G00949X/1","fundValue":"28149","fundStart":"2009-06-01","fundEnd":"2010-05-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  My findings have been used predominantly in the academic community.

Males increase their reproductive effort with age, whereas female reproductive effort decreases with age.\n\n(2) We found a positive genetic correlation between the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS, measured through protein carbonylation) and the rate of ageing. This relationship was stronger in females than males.\n\n(3) We found that ROS production was greater in females than males and this reflects the sex-difference in lifespan in this species.\n\n(4) We found very limited evidence that antioxidants (carotenoids and vitamin E) increases lifespan in crickets.\n\n(5) We found that diet (specifically the intake of protein and carbohydrates) had a large effect on lifespan and reproduction. Importantly, the optimal combination of these macronutrients to maximise lifespan and reproduction were different for the sexes. Given the current focus of policymakers and regulators (such as DEFRA) on food protection there is also the possibility that our research could have agricultural applications, such as increasing the yield of animal products and improving animal welfare. The main users of our research will be other academics. We expect this use will be widespread, with researchers worldwide examining the mechanistic basis for the relationship between food, sex and death applying the protocols we have developed in Education","dataset":"gtr"}
