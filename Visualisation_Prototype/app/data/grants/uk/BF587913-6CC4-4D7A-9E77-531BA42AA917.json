{"id":"BF587913-6CC4-4D7A-9E77-531BA42AA917","title":"Support for Coordination of COST-D40: Innovative Catalysis","abstractText":"COST-D40 is a chemistry Action in the area of 'Innovative Catalysis' involving 22 countries from around Europe and encompassing the activities of over 45 separate research groups. All these activities are coordinated from Nottingham by Simon Woodward (SW) who, as Chair of the Action, is charged with the smooth running of all aspects of programme including: organization of its research Working Groups, its review meetings and overall scientific personal exchanges. Although the EU's FP7 programme allows reimbursement for some travel costs of the Action members in D40 it provides no mechanism for the Chair of the Action to interact scientifically with the programme. After consultation with EPSRC this application has been made seeking a contribution to the increased consumables costs (k15.94 direct costs over 46 months) to SW's group caused by running and interacting with the D40 research programme.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F033478/1","grantId":"EP/F033478/1","fundValue":"36961","fundStart":"2008-01-01","fundEnd":"2011-10-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  As this programme involved the coordination of over 60 groups in Europe it is difficult to track the impact of every contribution.
