However, until recently, no systematic attempt to collect such data following major earthquakes has been made. Following the development of a questionnaire after the 2004 South Asian tsunami, surveys of survivors from three Asian earthquakes and tsunamis have now been carried out, to assess the experience of human casualties and their relationship to building damage and location. In the South Asian tsunami 500 questionnaires were completed, in the Pakistan earthquake a further 500 questionnaires were completed, and 120 questionnaires were completed after the Central Java tsunami in July 2006, all in collaboration with local teams. In this project it is intended to extend this work in three ways: first by carrying out another 500 interviews in Bantul district of Central Java following the May 2006 earthquake there; secondly, by building a database of the survey responses, and carrying out a detailed analysis of these reponses; and thirdly, by conducting a cross-event analysis and comparison with reconnaissance reports of these events from other sources.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F003331/1","grantId":"EP/F003331/1","fundValue":"16607","fundStart":"2007-08-01","fundEnd":"2008-01-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Robin  Spence","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
