Such drugs bind to a particular protein (the drug target) and this interaction affects the function the protein plays. These target proteins may be ones vital to the function an infectious micro-organism, an example would be the binding of AZT to the HIV reverse-transcriptase protein, stopping the virus hijacking the human cellular machinery to replicate its own genetic material. Or the drug target might be a human protein, an example being the binding of the antidepressant Prozac to the serotonin receptor, preventing this receptor from removing serotonin and so boosting serotonin levels and hence the patients mood. In many cases, an appropriate drug target protein is known for a particular disease in which case scientists can develop assays (tests) to determine if a small drug-like molecule can bind to the target protein and appropriately affect its function. Under these propitious circumstances, pharmaceutical companies may perform a &quot;high throughput screen&quot; whereby robotic equipment is used to test many hundreds of thousands of real small drug-like molecules using the assay. Where successful this process can identify so-called &quot;lead molecules&quot; which are the starting point for further development and assessment to produce an effective drug. Unsurprisingly, high throughput screening is a costly, time-consuming process and, of course, can only screen those compounds that they actually posses, whereas the number of possible chemical compounds that could exist is much larger. Hence scientists for several decades have tried to use cunning computer programs to try and perform something similar to a high throughput screen in a computer. Good progress was made in this endeavour during the 1990's leading to two basic approaches, virtual screening which looks at chemical similarities between molecules and molecular docking whereby the small molecules are &quot;docked&quot; into known protein structures (like a ship docking to a specific place in a port) and the affinity (or stickiness) of the small molecule to the protein is estimated. However, progress has been modest in the last decade for two related reasons. Firstly the number of docking poses (small-molecule positions) that can be tested is dependent on computing power. Secondly, assessing the binding affinity by computation (stickiness) is intrinsically difficult (no one has invented a very good quick way to do this) and this is also dependent on computing power. The purpose of this grant is to develop software to exploit a new type of processing hardware which is normally used in modern computers for handling the display graphics, the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). The advantage offered by a GPU is the large number (hundreds to thousands) of simple processing cores that it contains. This design of hardware is extremely efficient when the computing problem involves many very similar but independent calculations such as calculating the pixel properties on a screen. The same situation pertains in molecular docking calculations when many independent calculations of the positions of atoms, and the interaction between them, must be performed. Our preliminary experiments show that we can speed up molecular docking at least ten fold and still use the same amount of power that a conventional Central Processing Unit (CPU) would use. This, in turn, allows us to exploit a new way of calculating the binding energy (stickiness) of the small drug-like molecule to the protein target of interest that we have invented. By the end of the grant we will have a fully functional Molecular Docking program that will exploit GPU technology to share with other researchers. Also we will have assessed whether our new method of calculating binding energies is good enough to warrant further development. The ability to accurately screen a large number of small drug-like molecules against a protein target would be a significant step forward for drug discovery.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/K004050/1","grantId":"BB/K004050/1","fundValue":"120391","fundStart":"2012-09-01","fundEnd":"2014-02-28","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Richard  Sessions","coPersons":["Noah  Linden","Simon  McIntosh-Smith"],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
