Broadly, we group the activities of the centre in research themes that concern:\n\ni) Security Analysis and System Verification covering High Assurance Software, Static and Dynamic Analysis of Products and Systems, Software Engineering Techniques, Provable Security, and Formal Methods\n\nii) Operational Systems and Information Assurance covering Access Control, Privacy, Intrusion and Anomaly Detection, Intrusion Tolerance Techniques, Data Centric Security, Recovery Techniques, Real-Time Situational Awareness, Trust and Risk, and Key management.\n\nThe themes are applied in a variety of contexts, from embedded sensing systems such as body area networks for healthcare, through infrastructure monitoring, unmanned autonomous systems, operating systems, middleware and large scale distributed systems architectures to web-based and cloud computing environments.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K00414X/1","grantId":"EP/K00414X/1","fundValue":"50041","fundStart":"2012-07-01","fundEnd":"2017-06-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Emil Constantin Lupu","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
