Although a vaccine is available, there are still millions of children and adults living with a long term (chronic) HBV infection. As current treatments for those chronically infected with HBV are limited or ineffective, developing more successful therapies is extremely important. This requires a greater understanding of not only the virus but also of how the immune system responds to this viral infection. HBV does not directly cause the liver disease seen with chronic infection. This liver damage is thought to be because of the immune response elicited by the virus. Natural Killer (NK) cells are cells of the immune system whose function is to locate and kill infected or damaged cells. NK cells are a large population found within a normal liver, but little has been done to identify what role this cell population has on HBV liver disease. NK cells could contribute to liver damage in two ways: (1) by the production of cytokines, chemicals of the immune system which influence the function and recruitment of other immune cells, and (2) through direct killing of the infected liver cells. We aim, therefore, to identify the role of NK cells in liver disease and determine by what mechanisms they contribute to liver damage in chronic HBV infected patients. Blood samples will be taken from chronic HBV patients with varying degrees of liver disease with full informed consent and liver samples used will be surplus from those taken for diagnostic purposes. A better understanding of those mechanisms that are instrumental in the onset of liver disease should allow for the development of better therapies for treatment and prevention of HBV liver disease.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0501132","grantId":"G0501132","fundValue":"315042","fundStart":"2006-02-07","fundEnd":"2009-02-06","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Claire  Dunn","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
