Recognising this, EU legislation (the Water Framework Directive) now requires improvements in the chemical and ecological status of European freshwaters. The primary influences on water quality are biological and chemical reactions in the soils and rocks of water catchment areas, and similar reactions in streams, rivers and lakes. The pathways water takes through catchment areas are also important in determining both the quantity and quality of water in lakes and rivers. All these influences are being affected by environmental change: in climate; in agriculture and other land uses; and in the development of industry, transport and urbanisation. This is in turn affecting water quantity and quality, but predicting the effect of such changes is difficult. Various computer models have been used to predict the effects of these changes, with some success. However, it has been known for some time that they have severe limitations in predicting future trends in water quality: for instance, different models may be equally good at explaining the present situation, but may produce very different predictions when run into the future. One way to develop improved models is to incorporate into them a better understanding of environmental processes which can be achieved through making more detailed environmental measurements on streams and rivers. This in turn requires the development of innovative methods of measurement. The focus of this project is to take advantage of recent developments in analytical science to develop a system for making high-frequency chemical measurements in lakes and rivers which will be cheaper, more reliable under field conditions, and have low power and reagent consumption. This should make it possible to collect much more detailed data, which can then be used to develop improved predictive models, possibly requiring quite new approaches. This is an interdisciplinary project involving chemists, engineers and environmental modellers from the Universities of Reading and Hull, the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology and the Environment Agency.Over the last few years, considerable progress has been made in shrinking and redesigning apparatus used for chemical analysis so it can fit on a glass or plastic plate about 4 x 4 cm in size - the so called lab on a chip technology. This project will develop this technique to measure more substances of environmental importance, and ruggedize the equipment so it can be used in the field. The measurements will be compared with conventional technology, and effort will be put in to improving the accuracy, precision and stability of the equipment until we have a viable analysis system. The data generated by both new and conventional equipment will be used for model development and to improve understanding of the processes influencing water quality and quantity.If successful, the project should lead to a wide range of applications and benefits. As well as an improved ability to predict the effects of environmental change, a cheap and reliable method for monitoring water quality will help regulatory agencies, industries and agriculture monitor and mitigate their environmental impacts, and provide a method for the early detection of polluted water supplies, for instance from toxic algal blooms or acts of terrorism. The low power requirements mean that measurements away from mains power supplies become a practical proposition, with potential applications in developing countries as well as the UK. The devices could be used to monitor the chemistry of water streams in industrial processes, and may lead to the development of a commercial product, providing income to the UK economy and the higher education sector.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G014221/1","grantId":"EP/G014221/1","fundValue":"148618","fundStart":"2009-09-01","fundEnd":"2013-02-28","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The data collected in thee wider project has been provided for other researchers to use.

Data sets were collected successfully with commercially available analysers that were capable of analysing single analyte species. The project showed the need, however for simple low cost analysers that could detect a full suite of nutrients.\n\nThe University of Hull contributed to the project by developing a lab on a chip device for the separation and detection for a range of nutrients. The lab on a chip device developed included sample introduction, separation and detection. After initially investigating ion chromatography it was realised that this technique would not be sufficiently robust for continuous monitoring without regular servicing. It was therefore decided that capillary electrophoresis with in a chip would be more effective. For this technique to be successful it was vital to ensure that the sample matrix did not affect CE separation process. To solve this problem a novel sample introduction approach was utilised. Detection was achieved contactless conductivity detector and an electronic background suppression system was developed.\n\nGlass microchips with channels of 200 um have been utilised for this application. These have a widened channel through which the water sample flows, with the anions (or captions) been extracted into a side channel through an inset potassium silicate frit. This process preconcentrates the ions which can then be introduced to microfluidic channel for separation. This approach has been investigate and optimised in terms of time and frequency utilising a contactless conductivity detector connected in line. Natural water samples have been passed through the widened channel of the chip for long periods of time without fouling occurring. A reliable portable monitoring system for insitu analysis for nutrients can be used for to give high resolution data for monitoring nutrient levels in rivers, lakes and oceans. It could also be used for effluent monitoring. The final system will require following on funding in partnership with industry to take the prototype and produce a marketable device.
