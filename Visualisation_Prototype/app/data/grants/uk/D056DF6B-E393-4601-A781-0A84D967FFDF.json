The research base that has elevated the discipline was created over more than two decades of flight and ground-based simulation testing, supported by modelling and simulation, and undertaken by multi-national teams of engineers and pilots.\n\nAlongside these endeavours, the technologies for flight simulators have been developing, but have lacked the benefit of an underpinning research base. The metrics and tolerances in current standards are derived from fixed-wing criteria and shown to be lacking in a number of important aspects. The EPSRC funded research at Liverpool, Lifting Standards (2008-11), has developed a more rational basis for quantifying simulation fidelity, using a handling qualities approach. The research at Liverpool features the 6 degree of freedom motion simulator, HELIFLIGHT-R, alongside close collaboration with the Flight Research Laboratory (NRC, Ottawa). Metrics for predicting fidelity and capturing pilot perceptual fidelity have been derived and used in the development of a new unified approach to qualification. Central to the approach is the need to understand and quantify the level of adaptation that pilots apply as they transition from the simulator to flight. Beyond a certain level of adaptation, the resulting negative training means that safety and operational capability may be compromised. Within the concept of strategy adaptation is the degree of control compensation and hence the link between handling quality and fidelity strengthens. Outstanding questions concern the acceptable tolerances on predicted and perceptual fidelity metrics that a simulator is 'fit for purpose'; what constitutes Level 1 fidelity, and how critical are the handling qualities to this question are continuing research questions. \n\nThese questions formed the backdrop to the American Helicopter Society (AHS) workshop on Simulation Fidelity held in Virginia Beach, May 2011. The workshop, chaired by the proposer, was attended by more than 70 delegates and seeds were sown for further collaboration between research laboratories and industry to develop the required evidence base; there is a historical perspective to the development of best practice that needs to be brought into the continuing research. Much has been left poorly documented. In this short research project, the proposer will bring these themes together.\n\nA core activity of the research project will be the preparation of the prestigious AHS Nikolsky paper and lecture, and dissemination at various US Centres, where the opportunity will be taken to reinforce collaboration. Padfield will review the developments of handling qualities criteria since the birth of the practical helicopter 70 years ago. The key innovations that have allowed the industry to break through the barriers to formulating and adopting quality criteria will be identified and described. The critical enabling flight control technologies will also be reviewed and the continuing developments that confer super handling analysed and conjectured. The improvements in rotorcraft handling qualities should have a massive impact on safety and operational capability on the one hand and the technical requirements and training effectiveness of simulators on the other. The author will take the opportunity to strengthen the collaboration on handling qualities and simulation fidelity, setting the stage for the 2012 fidelity workshop in Fort Worth and continuing collaboration into 2013","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J020818/1","grantId":"EP/J020818/1","fundValue":"15040","fundStart":"2012-04-19","fundEnd":"2013-10-18","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"G D  Padfield","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":" the presentation of the Nikolsky Lecture by Gareth Padfield at 9 different venues in North America and Europe has provided the opportunity to spread best practice in the discipline and also forge new collaborations with different organisations and the University of Liverpool, e.g. NASA Ames, CAE Montreal, DLR Braunschweig. certification organisations, design engineers presentations and publication of journal paper (JAHS, January 2013) and technical report Aerospace/ Defence and Marine","dataset":"gtr"}
