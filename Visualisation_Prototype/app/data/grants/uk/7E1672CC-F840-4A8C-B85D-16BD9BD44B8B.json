Phenomena that are intrinsically quantum mechanical, such as magnetism, electron transport in semiconductors, and the effect of impurity atoms in materials, lie at the heart of almost every branch of industry. Quantum mechanical calculations of properties and processes from ``first-principles'' are capable of making accurate quantitative predictions but require solving the Schrdinger equation which is extremely difficult and can only be done using powerful computers. In contrast, empirical modelling approaches are relatively cheap but lack the predictive power of first-principles methods (which are parameter-free and take as input only the atomic numbers of the constituent atoms). The predictive capability is essential, in order to make rapid progress on new and challenging problems where there is insufficient experimental data and to also generate useful empirical approaches or even to check their reliability when these exist. Within the class of first-principles methods, one approach that has been outstandingly successful is the Density Functional Theory (DFT) as it combines high accuracy with moderate computational cost. Nevertheless, the computational effort of performing calculations with conventional DFT approaches increases as the cube of the number of atoms, making them unable to tackle problems with more than a few hundred atoms even on modern supercomputers. Since the pioneering work of the Nobel laureate Walter Kohn, it has been known that it is possible to reformulate DFT so that it scales linearly, which would in principle allow calculations with many thousands or even millions of atoms. The practical realisation of this however, in a method which is as robust and accurate as conventional cubic-scaling DFT approaches has been extremely difficult. The ONETEP approach developed over many years by the applicants of this proposal has achieved just that. ONETEP is at the cutting edge of developments in first principles calculations. However, while the fundamental difficulties of performing accurate first-principles calculations with linear-scaling cost have been solved, only a small core of functionality is currently available in ONETEP which prevents its wide application. In this collaborative project between three Universities, the original developers of ONETEP will lead an ambitious workplan whereby the functionality of the code will be rapidly and significantly enriched. The code development ethic of ONETEP, namely that software is robust, user-friendly, modular, portable and highly efficient on current and future HPC technologies will be of fundamental importance and will be further strengthened by rigorous cross-checking between the three institutions of this proposal. The developments are also challenging from a theoretical point of view as they need to be within the linear-scaling framework of ONETEP, using its highly non-trivial formulation of DFT in terms of in situ optimised localised functions. The program of work provides much added value as the few fundamental enabling technologies that will be developed in its first stages will then underpin many of the functional capabilities that will follow. The result will be a tool capable of a whole new level of materials simulation at the nanoscale with unprecedented accuracy. It will find immediate application in simulations in molecular biology, nanostructures and materials, which underpin solutions in urgent current problems such as energy, environment and health. Through the increasing number of commercial and academic users and developers of ONETEP, the worldwide dissemination and wide use of this novel tool will be rapid; finally the expanding ONETEP Developers' Group will coordinate the best strategies for the future maintenance and development of the software.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G05567X/1","grantId":"EP/G05567X/1","fundValue":"387299","fundStart":"2009-10-01","fundEnd":"2013-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Two key goals in this project were (i) to maximise the economic impact of the ONETEP code by enabling new types of simulations of materials; and (ii) to maximise its potential impact by making the ONETEP code usable across multiple disciplines, particularly by researchers who do not consider themselves experts in electronic structure theory.\n\nFor this reason, we partnered with Accelrys (now Biovia), a leading provider of scientific software that supports industries and organizations that rely on scientific innovation to differentiate themselves.\n\nAccelrys and its customers recognized early on that ONETEP offers the technology to perform simulations that are currently unattainable in any other way and in a package that is accessible to industry R&amp;D teams. This led to the decision by Accelrys to license ONETEP via Cambridge University's technology transfer office (Cambridge Enterprise Ltd) and to support it in their Materials Studio graphical user interface, enabling its use for R&amp;D within a range of industries.

With modern computers and software, this challenge is routinely met with a technique called &amp;amp;quot;density functional theory&amp;amp;quot; (DFT), which seeks to simplify this complex problem into a description solely based on the electron density at each point in space. However, traditional approaches to DFT are not suitable for systems which are large on the quantum-mechanical scale, those comprising thousands of atoms. This is because the computational effort of such methods increases in proportion to the cube the number of atoms.\n\n\n\nWe have developed, over the last decade, methods to circumvent this poor scaling and replace it with algorithms which scale only linearly with system size. This work has resulted in a package called ONETEP, which is now able to harness the power of modern supercomputers to perform highly-accurate simulations of large-scale nanostructures such as carbon nanotubes, semiconductor nanocrystals, and whole proteins. \n\n\n\nONETEP is at the cutting edge of developments in first principles calculations. However, while the fundamental difficulties of performing accurate first-principles calculations with linear-scaling cost have been solved, at the start of this grant in 2009 only a small core of functionality was available in ONETEP. During the course of this project, the original developers of ONETEP led an ambitious work plan whereby the functionality of the code was significantly enriched while maintaining the code development ethic of ONETEP, namely that software is robust, user-friendly, modular, portable and highly efficient on current and future high-performance computing technologies. \n\n\n\nThe developments were also challenging from a theoretical point of view as they had to be formulated within the linear-scaling framework of ONETEP, using its formulation of DFT in terms of in situ optimised localised functions. While there is still much more to be done, the result of this project is a software tool that is already capable of advanced materials simulation at the nanoscale with unprecedented accuracy and which has already found application in simulations in molecular biology, nanostructures and materials, which underpin solutions in current priority areas such as energy, environment and health. The developments that were made as part of this project are available for use by the wider community of electronic structure researchers in academia and industry on a broad range of scientific problems. \n\nSeveral of the publications resulting from this work describe the reformulation of theory and its implementation for use in a linear-scaling approach, which will be of benefit to the developers of other electronic structure codes.
