{"id":"95E2788D-4986-4ABC-98C1-8050F0887065","title":"Fossil Poetry: Anglo-Saxon and Linguistic Nativism in the Nineteenth Century","abstractText":"How do ideas about Anglo-Saxon as a literary medium, and as the point of origin of the English language (itself fast becoming the pre-eminent global language as the lingua franca of the British Empire) play themselves out in the poetry of the nineteenth century? What is the relationship between history, philology, politics and creativity in this period? How do poets, ever concerned with the accumulation of story in language, participate in Anglo-Saxon ism, simultaneously influencing and being influenced by the evolution of a cult phenomenon into a scholarly discipline?\n\nFossil Poetry attempts to answer these and related questions, and discover what the beginnings of 'English culture' meant to writers in a time when the idea of an Anglo-Saxon world empire was at its zenith. In doing so, Fossil Poetry also examines William Morris's translation of Beowulf, 'the first English epic', as acclaimed in its own day as Seamus Heaney's translation is now, as well as Tennyson's translation of The Battle of Brunanburh, as patriotic a piece of verse as his 'Charge of the Light Brigade'. The peculiar relationship between Gerard Manley Hopkins's poetry and the cult of Anglo-Saxon ism is also treated in depth.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/E50373X/1","grantId":"AH/E50373X/1","fundValue":"22490","fundStart":"2007-02-05","fundEnd":"2007-06-04","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Chris  Jones","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of St Andrews","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
