{"id":"C2EF4747-ADCF-4FFA-893D-3D52950CE7C7","title":"Support for the Face and Gesture Recognition 2006","abstractText":"In April 2006 the UK will be the host to the most prestigious and largest international conference that is entirely devoted to face and gesture recognition. Over the years this conference has been the forum in which many of the most innovative developments in the field have been first announced. For the first time in its 12 year history the conference will be held in the UK. This is an outstanding opportunity to showcase UK research and development at a premier international forum, and an ideal event to benefit the broad training of young researchers. This proposal seeks funds to help to run this international conference. The grant will support student attendance at the event, support research student training by holding a dedicated PhD forum, and help us support recognised international leaders to present the plenary keynote addresses. Finally, a small contribution is sought to the costs of secretarial and technical support.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D034833/1","grantId":"EP/D034833/1","fundValue":"13022","fundStart":"2006-04-10","fundEnd":"2006-07-09","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Mark S Nixon","coPersons":["Josef  Kittler"],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
