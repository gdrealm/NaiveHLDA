The first is to make accurate experimental measurements of droplets within a liquid. The second is to use these measurements to develop mathematical models that can describe the system.Experimental Techniques:Droplets dispersed in a liquid undergo many different processes. Currents within the fluid can cause the droplets to follow convoluted paths. In the course of this flow through the liquid, they can join together to form large droplets, break up to form smaller ones, and their chemical composition can change through diffusion.

Bubble size distributions were obtained but limited to gas voidages &lt;10%. As a result of this MRRC have used this project, in part collaboration with Microsoft Research, to explore further advances in MR applications to multi-phase systems. New MRI protocols and k-space sampling strategies have been developed to capture quantitative information from non-steady state systems. In particular we have developed a new single shot GERVAIS technique that captures snapshot images of the internal velocity field of a rising droplet in a two-phase liquid system in less than 125ms. Furthermore, we have developed fast spin-echo imaging, along with data analysis, that allows us to track both the translational movement of a rising droplet and indeed follow how its shape changes, in the form of different bubble breathing modes, during its rising event, in addition to be able to continuously track liquid dynamics in a three phase system. Direct measurement of liquid-liquid mass transfer coefficients has also been demonstrated. \n\nBubble sizing in dynamic bubble swarms using data that has been acquired with non-linear sparse k-space sampling strategies combined with Bayesian Analysis been successfully applied. Significant challenges in both data acquisition, analysis and experimental set-up were overcome to achieve this goal. Some of the numerical techniques developed within this project can and have already been applied in industrial consultancy projects as well as academia. Chemicals,Other","dataset":"gtr"}
