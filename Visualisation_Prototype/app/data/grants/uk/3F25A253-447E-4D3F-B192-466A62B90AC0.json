There remain many grand challenges in the field of oxidation chemistry which tantalise scientists, yet their solution always seems just out of reach. One in particular are the selective oxidation of methane to methanol and this will be addressed in this proposal. At present, most oxidation processes require activated hydrocarbon molecules, such as alkenes, to be effective. However, methane is abundant and the identification of a catalyst for the direct selective oxidation of methane would revolutionalise industry. Unfortunately, indirect utilization via synthesis gas is the only commercially viable possibility at present. This proposal aims to investigate the direct oxidation of methane to methanol using a novel low temperature approach in which the activation is induced within micropores of zeolitic materials. Methanol can then be utilized as a precursor for ethene and propene formation using well known Methanol-to-Olefins processes.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F068379/1","grantId":"EP/F068379/1","fundValue":"278124","fundStart":"2008-04-01","fundEnd":"2011-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  This is fundamental research and the findings have yet to be taken up commercially Chemicals Economic","person":"Graham  Hutchings","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":" We discovered a new catalyst based on a microporous material that can oxidise methane to methanol at 50 C with very high specificity We are in discussions with companies to take this reserach forward Chemicals","dataset":"gtr"}
