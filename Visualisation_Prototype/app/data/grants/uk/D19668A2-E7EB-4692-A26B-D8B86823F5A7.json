This involves sending acoustic &amp;amp;quot;chirp&amp;amp;quot; signals through cargo, whilst still on the lorry, as it passes slowly passed a measurment station at a port or other location. The techniques would be used to image internal contents, and to identify certain objects via resonances. \n\n\n\nA specific aim is to develop techniques that could eventually generate a 3-dimensional representation of the internal contents of a cargo and to &amp;amp;quot;virtually unpack&amp;amp;quot; its contents via one technique - and to very quickly detect concealed voids and cavities that may contain persons and/or contraband via the second technique. One major advantage that these methods offer over existing technology is that comparatively they would be extremely cheap to manufacture and (very importantly when considering the nature and location of their deployment) is that they are completely safe and present little hazard to human health and are completely non-radiological and non-ionising. Another important advantage is that owing to the differences in the speed of sound through different solid metals, it would be relatively simple to readily characterise and distinguish nuclear material from other dense metals in the instance of their camouflaged transportation in clandestine shipments. \n\n\n\nThe work has used a collaboration between three distinct sets of expertise: the University of Warwick (practical use of chirp waveforms for air-coupled acoustics), the British Geological Service (BGS)/University of Leicester for modelling and waveform analysis and Prof Zimmermann for security issues.\n\n\n\nThe research has demonstrated that it is indeed possible to transmit acoustic signals through a trailer containing cargo in form of boxes or crates. This requires the careful use of the correct types of waveform and signal processing. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe feasibility study has concluded that this new approach to cargo screening has merit, and that further funding from EPSRC should be sought to develop it into a practical technique. The feasibility study led to a full proposal being submitted to EPSRC, but this was not funded. The approach, however, was communicated to the Home Office Scientific Branch for their potential future use. Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Security and Diplomacy","dataset":"gtr"}
