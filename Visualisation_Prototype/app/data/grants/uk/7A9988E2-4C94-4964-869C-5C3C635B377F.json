In 2009, for the first time, the use of mobile phones was more prevalent than fixed-line phones across the UK. In 2008 a quarter of mobile subscriptions, or 17.9 million, were to new, high speed, 3G services. In the first quarter of 2009 more than 8 million people in the UK (16% of adults) access the internet on their mobile phones, an increase of 42% on the previous year. This growth has in part been driven by the increasing use of smartphones, which accounted for 16% of all handset sales in the first quarter of 2009, and the increasing use of mobile applications. In the first quarter of 2009 11% of households had a mobile connection but no fixed-line connection, however, and more significantly, 22% of households in socioeconomic group DE are mobile-only. If cultural heritage institutions aim to not only increase visitor numbers but broaden their visitor demographics beyond ABC1 socioeconomic groups then mobile compatible web sites will be a crucial component. This change in online access patterns is equally important for the HEI partners in the project if they are to fulfil their ambition of making the fruits of academic research more accessible to the general public.\\n\\nIn addition to broadening and increasing access the mobile interface to the 'Mapping Sculpture' database enables in situ research, exploration and discovery. This is a significant paradigm shift in the way all users (academic and non-academic alike), can encounter, explore and interpret the sculpture immediately in front of them: There is a limit to the amount of information that object labels and information boards can contain. Even the most comprehensive exhibition catalogue would struggle to convey the multiple and complex relationships that the Mapping project has discovered. Providing online access can overcome these problems and was one of the key drivers in providing an online, open access database in the original project. However, online access through fixed-line internet connections ties the user to their desk and dislocates the additional information from the object. Wireless internet connection through a laptop is one solution to this problem but is ultimately compromised by the variable availability of Wi-Fi hotspots, the bulk and expense of laptops and their still limited battery life in comparison to mobile phones.\\n\\nThe 'Mobilising Mapping' project will also enhance the functionality for users through the new mobile interface. The interface will add personalisation functionality enabling users to save information from the database into a personal folder. This enables users to build their own 'virtual collection' of records for later research, study or sharing. This service can combine reference to data on the project website with other online resources by providing the facility to share the record links via users existing research, study, social and networking structures such as delicious.com, Facebook, Digg and iGoogle thus further disseminating the valuable resources of the project.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/H037764/1","grantId":"AH/H037764/1","fundValue":"61462","fundStart":"2010-03-01","fundEnd":"2011-04-01","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  We have a far better understanding of the barriers to use of mobile technology in the cultural heritage sector from the users perspective. Our capability to develop appropriate functional and technical specifications has been enhanced. Our understanding of effective user evaluation methods has been improved.

The rationale behind this development was that it would facilitate in situ engagement, exploration and research and enable users to collate and share their interaction with Mapping Sculpture through personalization features and social networking tools. Additional benefits would come through being able to engage the wider public in an innovative way, particularly new audiences outside academia, for whom mobile phone access is becoming ubiquitous. The latter was a particularly important consideration for the project's museum partners, the Victoria and Albert Museum and the Henry Moore Institute. Further research needs to be undertaken on the uptake, viability and use of mobile devices for enhanced engagement and understanding within the museum and gallery context. Whilst there are range of possible applications of mobile and related technologies, we do not yet have a good enough understanding of how and why users might benefit, what type of activity they best support and the most effective means of deployment.
