{"id":"93CD22F8-8608-4E00-9969-EB44BE4F24D8","title":"Rapid Growth Algae: An enabling technology to enhance algal growth and reduce algal production costs","abstractText":"We have discovered a novel gene that significantly accelerates the growth of commercially used microalgae. This novel gene offers the opportunity to grow algae faster without or limited addition of nutrients or increased light and therefore offers potential solutions to companies wishing to develop commercial algal strains, which save on algal growth costs. We have filed patent applications for the use of this novel gene. In order to take this technology to market we need to understand fully the market and develop a commercialisation and technical development plan. We seek funding from the NERC Pathfinder fund to commission market research and to work with our commercial partner to develop a robust commercialisation strategy.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/M005755/1","grantId":"NE/M005755/1","fundValue":"7985","fundStart":"2014-05-01","fundEnd":"2014-07-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  To prepare for an application to the Follow-on fund Energy Economic","person":"Thomas  Mock","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of East Anglia","findingsText":" The commercial potential of our discovery.
