My research project aiming at the completion of a book entitled Risorgimento in Exile investigates the contribution of the Italian exile community in England in the post-Napoleonic era to imagining a new Italian political and economic community. By looking at the writings and letters of such exiles, I intend to show that these &eacute;migr&eacute;s' involvement in debates with British, continental and American intellectuals, hitherto ignored in the historiography, points to the emergence of liberalism and patriotism as international ideologies shared by a community of intellectuals and revolutionaries from Southern Europe as well as Latin America.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=119493/1","grantId":"119493/1","fundValue":"3440","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2006-07-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Maurizio  Isabella","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Birkbeck College","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
