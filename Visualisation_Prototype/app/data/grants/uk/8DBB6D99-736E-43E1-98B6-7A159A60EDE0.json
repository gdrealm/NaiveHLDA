The cornea has unique mechanical characteristics which are not well represented by standard engineering material models and it can swell or shrink when the aqueous humour/tears becomes hypotonic or hypertonic. Corneal swelling can alter its mechanical properties, not only due to its thickness change but also due to the change of preexisting physiological stress which is related to the degree of stromal hydration. Refractive surgery disturbs the cornea as it simultaneously supports the intraocular pressure. This suggests that accurate models of the cornea should include the effect of the preexisting physiological stress state. This proposed project is an international travel grant proposal which is to support Dr Li's two international visits to develop the research collaboration with Stanford University and the University of Mississippi in USA. The research visits will focus on the development of triphasic biomechanics models for simulating the biomechanical behaviour of the human cornea. The triphasic model to be developed will include the interaction between the mechanical behaviour of the solid phase of the tissue, the flow of the liquid phase filled in the porous medium of the tissue, and the transport of the ionic species dissolved in the fluid phase. Nonlinear, anisotropic hyperelastic material constitutive models will be developed to simulate the mechanical behaviour of the tissue material in the solid phase. Fluid flow will be determined based on the fluid pressure and osmotic pressure in the fluid phase. The transport of ionic species will be determined based on the mechanisms of diffusion, migration and convection. The deformation of solid, flow of fluid and transport of ions are coupled each other by fluid pressure, osmotic pressure and variation of porosity. This project is to bring together a group of researchers with highly complementary expertise to work on a very complicated multi-disciplinary problem. The combination of world-leading expertise in different fields will make a unique contribution to this field.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G056501/1","grantId":"EP/G056501/1","fundValue":"22710","fundStart":"2009-10-09","fundEnd":"2011-08-09","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Long-Yuan  Li","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
