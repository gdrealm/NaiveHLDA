{"id":"1340E12A-8A51-4117-9735-591C6CE5C0BC","title":"Entrepreneurship Policy","abstractText":"<p>The series aims to integrate, synthesise and evaluate various disparate government entrepreneurship initiatives, by providing a systematic and rigorous treatment of the various areas where government interfaces with entrepreneurship. </p> \n<p>The underlying aim is to clarify and contribute to the policy debate on this important topic in the UK. Specific objectives include: advancing the academic debate by developing and sharing new knowledge and expertise emerging from current and ongoing cutting-edge research; integrating academics and policy makers who work in the field; generating useful and incisive overviews of current policies; and providing a training element to postgraduates. </p> \n<p>These aims and objectives will be achieved by holding regular seminars on dedicated topics relating to entrepreneurship policy, and inviting a mix of academics and non-academic users, as well as postgraduate students, to participate in the seminars. The speakers will be carefully selected to disseminate the highest quality research relating to the topic being explored. Postgraduate training would be delivered by involving postgraduates in the seminars and in dedicated additional afternoon sessions where they can present and gain feedback from seminar participants. Seminars will be widely publicised locally and nationally, and also through the Durham Centre for Entrepreneurship's website.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-451-25-4187","grantId":"RES-451-25-4187","fundValue":"15360","fundStart":"2006-09-11","fundEnd":"2008-11-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Simon  Parker","coPersons":["Alan  Hughes","David  Storey"],"organisation":"Durham University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
