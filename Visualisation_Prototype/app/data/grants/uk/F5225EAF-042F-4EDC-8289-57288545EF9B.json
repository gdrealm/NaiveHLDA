{"id":"F5225EAF-042F-4EDC-8289-57288545EF9B","title":"Violence and childhood:international perspectives","abstractText":"<p>This seminar series is concerned with the impact of violence on children's lives and concepts and practices of childhood. It brings together academics from development studies, international studies, sociology, psychosocial studies and social anthropology.</p>\n\n<p>The series provides a forum for exchange and debate between policy-makers, practitioners, academics, and students. The new social studies of childhood in the UK has had very little to say about international contexts and development practitioners have long taken children as the untarnished or innocent subject of their interventions. </p>\n\n<p>Academics working on the interface between development studies and the 'new' sociology of childhood have made important contributions to both childhood studies and development policy/practice however this work is almost entirely limited to developing policy interventions on poverty reduction, education and war. Whilst these are all obviously important areas for empirical study and theoretical inquiry this series seeks to broaden the understanding of childhood in an international perspective by focusing on violence experientially and conceptually. Its international focus allows for comparisons to be drawn in both understandings of violence and of childhood. </p>\n\n<p>This seminar series facilitates the interdisciplinary sharing of theoretical perspectives and empirical work and speaks to the recognition of international childhood as an emergent discipline. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-451-26-0658","grantId":"RES-451-26-0658","fundValue":"18463","fundStart":"2010-01-04","fundEnd":"2012-01-03","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Karen  Wells","coPersons":["Erica  Burman","Heather Kate  Montgomery","Alison Martha Watson","Virginia  Morrow"],"organisation":"Birkbeck College","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
