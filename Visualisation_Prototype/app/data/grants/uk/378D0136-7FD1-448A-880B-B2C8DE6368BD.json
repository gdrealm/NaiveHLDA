Research has shown that such 'unknown' face processing is surprisingly poor and that it is difficult to match a picture, perhaps on a passport, to a person. Error rates of 20% are common. This has serious implications for our security, since it is not possible to be sure of the identity of people entering the country, for example. The aim of this project is to study the process of becoming familiar with a face. Doing so will yield insights into how our memories work, and why they fail, and help to establish the best training to improve performance of those who need to match faces, such as border guards.\n\nAn obvious difference between a known face and an unknown one is the amount of experience we have of the face. We interact with friends on a regular basis, seeing them in different situations and from various angles. It seems that this enables us to create a memory for their face, which allows us to recognize it again in other situations, perhaps years later. Previous work has begun to study how we learn new faces, by presenting a variety of images; we propose to draw on the best of this work and, crucially, to study what is happening inside the brain during learning.\n\nOur method of observing brain function uses a measure of the electrical fields generated by the brain called Event-Related Potentials (ERPs). Previous work has suggested that there are two separate processes underlying our memory: familiarity and recollection. Familiarity, in this context, is the all too common experience - I've seen that face before, but where? Recollection brings relief, as you remember who it is and why you know them. Familiarity and recollection produce distinct patterns of electrical activity, which will allow us to monitor the process of developing memory and establish the best ways to encourage it. \n\nWe plan a series of experiments to study the process of learning a face, starting with simple repetition and progressing to varied views, methods to encourage thoughtful consideration of each face, and the effects of sleep on helping consolidate memories of new faces. The aim is to assess whether memory performance for unknown and known faces is associated with the same retrieval processes, or whether different retrieval processes are involved. Establishing the involvement of different retrieval processes in memory for known and unknown faces is theoretically important because it would link the poor performance in face recognition for unknown faces to differences in the mental representation underlying memory for different types of face. Clarifying the reason why known and unknown face recognition differs also has important implications for how face recognition can best be improved. Having identified the retrieval processes engaged, various mnemonic strategies will be used to promote face learning and 'bridge the gap' in recognition memory accuracy between the two types of face. Importantly, the analysis of brain activity will reveal exactly how changing the way unknown faces are studied leads to better memory - either by enhancing the deployment of retrieval processes associated with unknown faces, or by actually changing the processes engaged to match those used for known faces. Answering this question will provide important insight into the nature of memory representations that support successful face recognition, with implications for theoretical accounts of both episodic memory and face identification - informing future attempts to improve face recognition in real world contexts.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/L023644/1","grantId":"BB/L023644/1","fundValue":"327073","fundStart":"2014-11-30","fundEnd":"2017-11-29","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"David Ian  Donaldson","coPersons":["Peter  Hancock"],"organisation":"University of Stirling","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
