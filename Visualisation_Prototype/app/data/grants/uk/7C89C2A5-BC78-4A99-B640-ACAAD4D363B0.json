{"id":"7C89C2A5-BC78-4A99-B640-ACAAD4D363B0","title":"Crossovers: A Performance Matters DVD series","abstractText":"Crossovers will develop a series of DVD publications to amplify the dissemination and impact of cutting-edge film-works arising from the Performance Matters research activities. These eight films - including creative documentaries, an artist's feature film and specially recorded in-conversations with leading intellectuals - address marginal and untold histories of performance in inventive ways, and raise issues around the place of performance in new directions of contemporary thought.\n\nThe project will result in the professional post-production and distribution of these highly original and diverse works, making them available in screening formats and as purchasable DVDs. Alongside this, screenings to targeted media-industry professionals will be organised and contextualizing launch activities with major cultural sector partners will be mounted for diverse audiences. \n\nThe commercial dissemination, screening and contextualizing events will combine one-way and interactive engagements that will facilitate knowledge exchange. Contextualising events will significantly broaden the audience and critical reception of the research concerns of Performance Matters beyond its existing substantive academic and artistic audiences, especially to popular art, media and film festival audiences.\n\nThrough carefully considered interactive engagement, and follow-up events, Crossovers will also develop new and sustainable relationships between media-industry and other public-sector professionals and the individuals and institutions associated with the project. Building on the way that Performance Matters developed the research engagement of public sector partner the Live Art Development Agency, Crossovers will not only foster development of the Agency's publishing arm, but will also lead to sustained forms of knowledge exchange between performance scholars/organisers and film festival directors, video distributors and commissioning TV editors.\n\nIn this way, Crossovers is designed to build sustainable professional relationships around performance studies media-products that will have lasting effects beyond the period of the award.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/K003461/1","grantId":"AH/K003461/1","fundValue":"95356","fundStart":"2013-02-04","fundEnd":"2014-02-03","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  The research generated new ways of thinking and forged new forms of expression in creative and critical documentary filmic practice. The non-academic beneficiaries of this project fell into three distinct categories: the cultural sector partner and its organisational collaborators; specific invited media professionals and other cultural sector workers; and numerous audience members for the film works (and contextualising events) with interests in contemporary art, film, performance, club, sub-cultures and popular thought.\n\nFor the Live Art Development Agency, our cultural sector partner, there was an extension and diversification of its discursive and educational programming, an increase in its publishing outputs, as well as an expansion of its user constituencies in terms of reach and diversity. The work created active collaborations with new media and visual arts organisations; helped transform LADA's publishing activities towards accessible moving image production and distribution; created greater interaction with broadcast media professionals; and extended the organisation's user community in terms of scale and genres of interest.\n\nMedia professionals and curators were involved in discussion of this project's processes and outcomes creating further pathways to impact in a range of film festivals and programmes, galleries, critical reviews and other cultural events. \n\nCrossovers enhanced and shaped an interest in performance and its discourses in the public sphere, through debate at the screening events, and through the negotiation of further dissemination of Crossover titles through screenings, exhibition and DVD sales. These filmic works impacted beyond the national context with many international screenings of the works and in one instance translation and subtitling into another language.\nThe wide audiences for these works strengthened, deepened and enhanced high quality engagement with performance-related cultures and thinking.

These films looked at the multiple histories of performance art as it engages with mainstream TV, appears on the internet, in subculture, in stand-up comedy and in avant-garde art. Other documentary films explored ideas of performance in contemporary thought, through conversations with internationally renowned thinkers working at the forefront of their disciplines. Screening, contextualizing events and liaison work with broadcast and media professionals sought to embed and extend the avenues of dissemination, cultural influence and audiences for these works and their associated ideas. The project explored and demonstrated the increasing cultural force of performance in culture and in critical thought, making distinctive contributions to documentary practice, artist's film and video and the essay-film. It involved contributors and performance audiences that hitherto have been remote from academia, thereby expanding the stakeholders of contemporary performance research beyond the Higher Education sector. The research outputs of this project are of interest and use to artists, curators, critics and general audiences wishing to find extended reflection upon the history, forms and ideas associated with performance and live art. They present accessible filmic approaches to a range of artists, art works and thinkers with an important impact on contemporary cultural production. The outputs will be of particular interest to media and broadcast professionals who are seeking to provide exposure to this cutting-edge creative and critical work for a broad public.
