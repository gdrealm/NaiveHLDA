The UK MHD Consortium has an excellent track record in this area. PPARC has funded parallel computing facilities at Exeter and St Andrews for the benefit of UK MHD researchers. This support has enabled St Andrews to lever additional funding, through SRIF, to build a world-class parallel computing facility, allowing PPARC MHD researchers access to even better resources. This application is for support for the System Manager to ensure the smooth running of the parallel computer.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=PP/E001165/1","grantId":"PP/E001165/1","fundValue":"59144","fundStart":"2007-09-01","fundEnd":"2009-08-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"  The computing resources have provided the compuational means to investigate a wide variety of astrophysical, stellar and solar plasma phenomena.
