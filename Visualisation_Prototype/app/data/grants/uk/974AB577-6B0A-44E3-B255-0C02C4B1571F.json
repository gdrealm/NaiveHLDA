{"id":"974AB577-6B0A-44E3-B255-0C02C4B1571F","title":"Gaia-CU9 (Edinburgh component)","abstractText":"Gaia is the cornerstone ESA mission which will provide the first astrometric census of the sky. One billion sources will be surveyed, allowing major advances in Galactic structure and evolution, stellar evolution, solar system dynamics, exoplanetary systems, cosmology and fundamental physics. Gaia is scheduled for launch in December 2013. Its huge data set will revolutionise much of astrophysics, provided astronomers can access and understand the data. This proposal is to support the UK leadership roles in Gaia data delivery to users, especially in archive design, science requirements specification, documentation, and support for public-access interface software.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/L006561/1","grantId":"ST/L006561/1","fundValue":"214612","fundStart":"2014-03-31","fundEnd":"2019-03-30","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Robert Graham Mann","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
