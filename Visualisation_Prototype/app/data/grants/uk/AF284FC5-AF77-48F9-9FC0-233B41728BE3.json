{"id":"AF284FC5-AF77-48F9-9FC0-233B41728BE3","title":"Mechanisms and the evidence hierarchy","abstractText":"Evidence-based medicine is a relatively recent technique for supporting clinical decisions by the 'conscientious, explicit, and judicious use of current best evidence' (Sackett et al. 1996. BMJ. 312: 71). This 'best evidence' usually has a very specific meaning: the best evidence available to support decision-making in medicine is that arising from clinical trials, where treatments are tested on large numbers of patients. On the other hand, evidence of mechanisms - usually characterized as knowledge gained from experimental investigations in the laboratory - is held to be of low quality by the EBM practitioner.\n\nHowever, recent work in the philosophy of causality has suggested that this hierarchical interpretation of evidence is problematic. \n\nDecisions about treatment make a difference to the health of individuals. Therefore it is of utmost importance to develop a concept of evidence that maximizes the available sources of evidence (trials, results of lab experiments) and minimizes the risks of errors in various medical decisions.\n\nIn this project, we aim to investigate the relationship between evidence-based medicine, evidence of mechanisms, and causality from a number of different theoretical and practical perspectives including philosophy of causality, philosophy and history of medicine, and medical practice. \n\nVia collaborative workshops, and participation in an international conference in September 2012, both involving philosophers, historians and a number of medical scientists and practitioners, the members of the investigating team will probe these issues deeply.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/J011185/1","grantId":"AH/J011185/1","fundValue":"14217","fundStart":"2012-02-14","fundEnd":"2012-09-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  Our findings have helped to inform debate about how to improve evidence-based medicine. This impact has involved public health practitioners who are charged with drawing up guidelines and protocols for causal discovery in medicine.\n\nSuch debate took place at the conference ECitS 2012 (Evidence and Causality in the Sciences, University of Kent, UK, 5-7 September 2012), at a public engagement event (The hierarchy of evidence, Archaeology Lecture Theatre, Archaeology building, UCL, 5.30-7.30pm Monday 10th September 2012), and at three project workshops.\n\nThe project led to the creation of the EBM+ consortium, whose members are interested in improving the way in which evidence based medicine handle mechanistic evidence. The EBM+ consortium (www.ebmplus.org) continues the debate initiated by this project.

These hierarchies focus on statistical evidence for causal claims, and tend to champion the use of randomised controlled trials (RCTs). \n\nThis project explored the question of whether evidence of mechanisms should have a \n\nplace in evidence hierarchies, complementing statistical evidence such as that obtained from RCTs. \n\n\n\nThe project concluded that mechanistic evidence should indeed play a more prominent role in explicit hierarchies of evidence, for two reasons. First, recent work in the philosophy of causality and the history of medicine suggests that in order to establish a causal claim one needs to establish both a statistical connection between the putative cause and the putative effect and a mechanistic connection that can explain the statistical connection. Second, discussion with medical scientists and public health policy makers revealed that such practitioners often do take mechanistic evidence into account, but mostly in a tacit or implicit way, in contravention to the explicit recommendations of the hierarchies of evidence. Evidence hierarchies are widely applied in medicine and public health policy as well as the social sciences. If the conclusions of the project are correct, they should be of interest to all these areas. Healthcare","dataset":"gtr"}
