People from mainland China copied others significantly more than people from the UK, indicating that there may be East-West differences in people's reliance on social learning to solve novel and complex tasks. This provides experimental support for informal observations and indirect evidence that there are broad East-West differences in social learning within educational systems and business contexts.\n\n2. People from Hong Kong and Chinese immigrants in the UK both showed equivalent levels of social learning to the White British UK participants. This indicates that Western influence (either through historical British rule in Hong Kong, or being immersed in a Western society) can fairly quickly shift learning styles from individual to social learning. \n\n3. People from mainland China were less responsive to changes within the game (specifically, in what made a good artifact), whereas the other groups increased their social learning in response to uncertainty.\n\n4. These findings open up many new avenues for future research, such as the extent to which this cross-cultural variation extends beyond the UK and China; what factors are responsible for maintaining the cultural variation (e.g. education, mass media, peer observation, parental instruction); and how exactly learning styles shift in immigrants and East Asians exposed to Western influence.\n\n5. A novel international collaboration was developed between Alex Mesoudi (Durham, UK) and Lei Chang (CUHK, Hong Kong), which will strengthen links in this area between the UK and Hong Kong and lead to further grants and publications. \n\n6. The ESRC research fellow employed on the grant (Dr Keelin Murray) will benefit from at least one publication, training in lab experimental methods to study social learning, and has gone on to take up a 3-year postdoctoral position at the University of St Andrews.\n\n7.

Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B.\n\nMesoudi, A. &amp; Chang, L. (in prep) The evolution of cultural variation in social learning. Future research might explore the factors that maintain East-West differences in social learning, such as peer observation, parental instruction, mass media or education. Longitudinal studies might track immigrants as they are potentially influenced by their new and different society. \n\nTheoretical models examining the evolution and use of social learning need to incorporate the possibility that social learning might itself be socially learned. Lab experiments need to consider the cultural backgrounds of their participants in order to draw reasonable conclusions about 'human' social learning.\n\nReal-world implications include educational contexts, such as when East Asian students studying in the UK fail to adapt to a situation where copying others is considered plagiarism and penalised, even though it may be normal practice in their home country. In organisational contexts East Asian companies also rely less on innovation than Western countries, which may be rooted in these deeper differences in learning styles.
