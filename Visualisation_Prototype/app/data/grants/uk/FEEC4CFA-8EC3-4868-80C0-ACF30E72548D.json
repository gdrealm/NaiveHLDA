In particular, the feasibility study will\naim to demonstrate that metering and protection accuracy classes for voltage and current transducers are attainable by this\ntechnology.\nIn order to address the objectives of the project, the research programme will be subdivided into specific work packages.\nThe scope and methodologies adopted with respect to the individual tasks are described in the Case for Support\nattachment under the following work packages:\nWP1. Engagement with stakeholders (Month 1-12)\nWP2. Design and simulation of transducers and experiments. (Month 1-7)\nWP3. Assembly and packaging of electrical current and voltage transducers. (Month 4-7)\nWP4. Characterisation and environmental/high-voltage stress testing of transducers (Month 7-12)\nWP5. Development and testing of sensor interrogation hardware and software.
