They continuously patrol the body in search of unfamiliar or foreign molecules (antigens) that suggest the presence of microorganisms or cancer cells. T cells use receptors on their surface to detect antigen on the surface of other cells. This recognition is particularly important because T cells, in addition to themselves killing infected or cancerous cells, are needed to help other cells in the immune system do the same thing. T cell antigen recognition is the key to understanding both the appropriate immune responses to dangerous antigens (e.g. microorganisms) and the inappropriate responses to innocuous or self-antigens, which result in allergic and autoimmune disease, respectively. The T cell antigen receptor (TCR) is clearly very important and has been intensively studied. Nevertheless we still have an incomplete understanding of how TCR binding to antigen leads to a response by the T cell. In addition to the TCR T cells have on their surface accessory cell-cell recognition molecules that modulate antigen recognition. The main purpose of the proposed research is to use a number of powerful new techniques to study how the TCR works and how accessory molecules modulate antigen recognition. When T cells recognize foreign antigen they respond in a number of ways (e.g. activation or inactivation, proliferation or suicide) and differentiate to one of several functionally distinct T cell subsets. These choices have profound consequences since they determine whether and what kind of immune responses are made. An exciting advance in recent years has been the demonstration that these choices can be manipulated by the administration of reagents that interfere with the function of accessory cell-cell recognition molecules. There are strong grounds for believing that an improved understanding of T cell antigen recognition will facilitate rational manipulation the immune with a view to increasing the effectiveness of vaccines, treating autoimmune and allergic disease, and controlling rejection of transplanted organs.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G9722488","grantId":"G9722488","fundValue":"2720250","fundStart":"1998-12-01","fundEnd":"2009-07-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Philip Anton Van Der Merwe","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
