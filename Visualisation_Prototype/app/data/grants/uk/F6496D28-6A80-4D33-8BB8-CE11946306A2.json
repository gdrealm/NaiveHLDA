The ability to control the position of individual quantum systems is the fundamental key for the development single atom devices. In the case of quantum computing, precisecontrol of the internal quantum states is also required. We have identified promising impurity atoms in diamond that are optically active and have very long coherence times, even at room temperature. Optical technology for addressing individual atoms will be implemented for read-out of quantum information encoded in the spin of an individual atom. A secondary short-term objective is to develop efficient diamond-based single-photon sources for quantum communication. Finally, combining the technology of precise doping of single atoms with optical control has the potential to extend well beyond the standard paradigms of quantuminformation and spintronics.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E059015/1","grantId":"EP/E059015/1","fundValue":"216827","fundStart":"2007-07-01","fundEnd":"2010-06-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"John  Rarity","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
