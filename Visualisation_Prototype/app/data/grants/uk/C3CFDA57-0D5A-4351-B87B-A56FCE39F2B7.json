Therefore this proposal offers a unique opportunity to expand the audience for space science and exploration and the British participation in a ground-breaking space mission.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/L005352/1","grantId":"ST/L005352/1","fundValue":"10000","fundStart":"2014-04-11","fundEnd":"2015-07-10","funder":"STFC","impactText":"  Various outreach activities and associated press coverage.
