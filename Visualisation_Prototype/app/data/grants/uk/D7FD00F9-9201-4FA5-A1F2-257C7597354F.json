{"id":"D7FD00F9-9201-4FA5-A1F2-257C7597354F","title":"Modelling transport in graphene-based transistors","abstractText":"Stable films of one-atom thick sheets of graphite, known as graphene, were fabricated for the first time in 2004. The discovery of this new material sparked a huge amount of interest because the charge carriers in graphene have fascinating and unique properties, and because graphene has huge potential for nanoelectronic applications. This theoretical proposal will model the electronic transport properties of ultra-thin graphene films only two or three atomic layers thick. It will investigate the influence of external gate potentials that can smoothly and controllably switch the films between metallic and semiconducting conduction properties. This will lead to the ability to electrostatically define complete circuits, including graphene-based transistors, on a single ultra-thin graphene film.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E063519/1","grantId":"EP/E063519/1","fundValue":"198342","fundStart":"2007-10-23","fundEnd":"2010-04-22","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Edward  McCann","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Lancaster University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
