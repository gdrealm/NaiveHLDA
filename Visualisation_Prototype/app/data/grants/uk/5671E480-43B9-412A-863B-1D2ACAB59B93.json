In many UK universities Linguistics/Applied Linguistics is taught as part of undergraduate programmes in English, English Language and Modern Foreign Languages and as a result QM teaching is not integral to curricula. With regard to QM linguistics students are different from other social science students such as psychologists or sociologists for example, because many will have given up maths based subjects at 16 and will not have studied maths beyond GCSE level. On the whole, colleagues in both EL and MFL shy away from incorporating QM into the curriculum and assessment of their modules, mainly because their own education and research have lacked QM. Thus, the fragile teaching base of QM in social science UG programmes as identified by MacInnes (2009:2), is virtually absent in UG programmes which contain modules in EL/MFL/Linguistics/Applied linguistics. However, increasingly, postgraduate and research students in these subjects want to apply QM methods to the analysis of data, with an ensuing skills gap.This project develops and evaluates teaching of QM to linguists based within their current taught modules and taking into account their prior knowledge and experience.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J011975/1","grantId":"ES/J011975/1","fundValue":"79864","fundStart":"2012-04-01","fundEnd":"2013-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Timothy David Grant","coPersons":["Gertrud  Reershemius","Urszula Irena Clark"],"organisation":"Aston University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
