Thus, it is harder to set a roundabout turning when somebody is riding at the edge but easier if that person stands right in the middle. It is easy to set a frisbee spinning but hard to flip a javelin end-over-end. These observations are a consequence of the relationship between mass, geometrical structure and inertia. The same relationship allows study of the structure of a molecule through measurements of its molecular rotation. Microwave spectroscopy works by causing molecules to spin and then seeing how fast they rotate. Is a given molecule shaped more like a frisbee or a javelin? The technique can also be used to determine how atoms are arranged within a molecule and to accurately measure bond distances and angles between bonds. It can tell us whether a molecule is flexible or rigid. It can say how charge is distributed, telling us about the strength and nature of chemical bonds. In a novel application, I propose to use a new tool in microwave spectroscopy to determine whether reactions are catalysed on the surface of selected metal nanoclusters. The development of more efficient, selective and greener catalysts is a key challenge of modern research in chemistry. Catalysts are often used to accelerate chemical reactions and processes of commercial significance. Industry employs the surface environment provided by solid metals to catalyse the manufacture of a wide variety of chemical products, materials and foods. For example, margarine is produced using nickel metal as a catalyst. Researchers have already described how nanoclusters of metal atoms supported on surfaces can be highly effective catalysts. It is known that the size and topology (molecular landscape of the surface) of these units can have a profound influence on their catalytic properties. This proposal seeks to contribute fundamental information on the molecular mechanisms of catalysis on metal nanoclusters on the smallest possible scale. Carbon monoxide is known to poison catalytic materials, reducing their efficiency. Metal nanoclusters with adsorbed carbon monoxide will be one target of studies. H2O and CO yield H2 and CO2 in an industrially-important catalysed reaction that is a useful source of hydrogen fuel (the water gas shift reaction). I will study whether this reaction can occur on very small metal nanoclusters, and if so, whether its efficiency is a function of cluster size. Conventional Balle-Flygare Fourier transform microwave (FTMW) spectrometers possess a narrow, 1 MHz bandwidth and are unsuitable for collecting data rapidly. The proposed research will exploit the latest 21st century digital technology for the construction of a novel chirped pulse Fourier transform microwave (CP-FTMW)spectrometer. The new CP-FTMW instrument will be broadband and allow the collection of data over an 11 GHz frequency range simultaneously. Given that it will be possible to monitor the concentration of many different components in a gas sample simultaneously, this instrument may ultimately find applications in analytical science. It will also be perfectly suited to probe the microwave spectra of many biologically-significant molecules.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G026424/2","grantId":"EP/G026424/2","fundValue":"56320","fundStart":"2012-03-01","fundEnd":"2013-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The objectives of the original proposal were aimed at details of molecular structure relevant to applications of catalysis. While fundamental knowledge has been gained that has relevance in this sphere, the wider impact of research to date has emerged instead from the unique nature of the spectrometer constructed and instrumental innovations made during the project. Outcomes of research under EP/G026424 provoked the interest of AWE (Aldermaston). The rapid commercial development of electronic and microwave signal technology implies that it will be possible to construct instruments that are more capable and versatile than the present spectrometer, at economic cost, in the medium term. These are believed likely to find applications in gas sensing technologies of relevance to AWE. The company has therefore invested ?20k (in 2013) in the construction of a room temperature waveguide broadband rotational spectrometer by the PI. The capabilities of the constructed instrument were tested against trial systems selected by AWE (2013). Satisfied by the results, the company has since invested a further ?13k (during 2014) in explorations of the chemistry of boron. The benefits to the company (and hence the wider society/economy) have arisen from (i) access to research into new technologies of potential within the UK and (ii) access to people with experience and knowledge in their use. It is expected that the relationship established will provide the basis for future collaborations and knowledge exchange in the future.

Metal cluster ions have been generated (elsewhere) using laser vaporisation sources and studied by mass spectrometry. It therefore seems likely that we have not yet discovered the correct set of experimental conditions (in relation to the physico-chemical environment within the expanding gas sample) and we remain confident that this line of investigation will ultimately yield success. Our studies of molecules and complexes containing individual metal atoms continue to provide insight into experimental conditions, particularly in respect of the nature of chemistry occurring within transient plasma. While the administrative end-date of EP/G026424/2 has passed, experiments continue in pursuit of both the original scientific objectives and also along new lines of research prompted by successes during EP/G026424. \n\nThe CP-FTMW spectrometer constructed as part of EP/G026424/1 and used throughout EP/G026424/2 continues to be used and improved. It will have a useful lifetime extending many years into the future and is the principal equipment resource deployed on a current, major project funded by the European Research Council (ERC). A significant outcome of EP/G026424/1 and EP/G026424/2 has been that skills and knowledge crucial to the exploitation of opportunities in an area of rapid technical innovation have been secured within the U.K. Alongside the ERC project, these skills and the constructed spectrometer are currently being used in collaborative projects with an industrial partner, AWE(Aldermaston), which aim to apply broadband rotational spectroscopy for gas analysis and sensing. [Text reproduced under both EP/G026424/1 and EP/G026424/2] \nThe PI is currently responsible for a team comprising two postdoctoral workers and two postgraduate students and is building upon the outcomes of research performed under EP/G026424 through a current project funded by the European Research Council. A significant number of publications in peer-reviewed journals and conference presentations resulted from research performed under EP/G026424. These provoked the interest of potential collaborators in academia and industry. Given the recent significant increase in the speed of data acquisition, collaboration with researchers elsewhere is becoming increasingly important to the groupâ€™s work, permitting enhanced access to specialist knowledge and also researcher time for efficient analysis. Collaborations with researchers at the University of Leicester and Waterloo (Canada) are expected to yield publications. Beyond academia, the PI is currently engaged with AWE(Aldermaston) in research aimed at applying broadband rotational spectroscopy for industrially-relevant applications of trace gas sensing and analysis. The commercial significance of gas sensing applications and opportunities likely to arise from related, rapidly-developing technologies confirm the importance of growing connections with collaborators in these areas.
