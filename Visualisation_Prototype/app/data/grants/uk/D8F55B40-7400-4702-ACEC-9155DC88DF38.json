{"id":"D8F55B40-7400-4702-ACEC-9155DC88DF38","title":"Electronic Sonotweezers: Particle Manipulation with Ultrasonic Arrays","abstractText":"We have carefully planned this research programme to pioneer a wholly new capability in ultrasonic particle manipulation to allow electronic sonotweezers to take their place alongside optical tweezers, dielectrophoresis and other techniques in the present and future particle manipulation toolkit.Following end-user demand, particle manipulation is a rapidly growing field, notably applied to the life sciences, with emerging applications in analysis and sorting, measurement of cell forces and tissue engineering. Existing devices have valuable capabilities but also limits in terms of forces that can be produced and measured, particle sizes that can be handled, their range of compatible buffer characteristics and sensitivity to heating, and suitability for integration with sensors in low cost devices. Key to our programme is the concept of dynamic potential energy landscapes and the established ability of ultrasound to create such landscapes, potentially to generate forces under electronic / computer control. Our principal technical aim is to exploit this in integrated sonotweezers to apply and measure larger forces over longer length scales, extend micromanipulation to larger particles, and demonstrate this in pathfinder applications in life sciences.To achieve our aims, we have already carried out successful feasibility studies and brought together an outstanding multidisciplinary team of investigators including internationally established members, some of the UK's most exciting young scientists and engineers, and appropriate overseas collaborators. Such a team is a prerequisite for what we recognise as a challenging, highly complex, densely interlinked programme. Over its four years, with strong management and built-in research flexibility, we will explore key areas of science, technology and applications to create and demonstrate electronic sonotweezers. Throughout the work, there will be parallel activity in understanding of physical principles, modelling and design, state-of-the-art fabrication, sensor integration, and applications testing.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G01213X/1","grantId":"EP/G01213X/1","fundValue":"1319940","fundStart":"2009-06-01","fundEnd":"2013-11-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The Sonotweezers programme in Dundee has had two major outcomes:\n\n- In popular science / education, the possibility to establish a sonic screwdriver and an acoustic tractor beam were established.

The Sonotweezers programme was based on work at four different universities to explore this technique, with a key innovation being the use of software and electronics connected to more than one individual ultrasound device to control the position of one or more objects.\n\nThe role of the University of Dundee in the programme was to design, build and demonstrate the arrays of ultrasound devices around which the Sonotweezers concept was based. This was accomplished successfully with quite a broad range of ultrasound arrays.\n\nThe simplest of these were individual devices operating at high frequency to apply relatively large forces to test particles in the form of polystyrene beads and biological cells. Whilst force generation was accomplished, the forces applied to the cells were not large enough to meet the original aim to oppose the natural process by which cells move towards sources of attractive chemicals or nutrients, called chemotaxis.\n\nAnother class of device comprised a number of individual, long, narrow ultrasound devices arranged with their long axes parallel to one another. Under software and electronic control, these allowed controlled movement of agglomerates of beads larger than could be moved without modifying the beads. The agglomerates were also moved over larger distances than can be achieved with other techniques.\n\nStill another class of devices comprised individual ultrasound devices up to more than 1,000 in number arranged in a two-dimensional array in regular rows and columns. Some of these devices were manufactured in the Fraunhofer Institute for Ceramic Technology and Systems to demonstrate the possibility to produce them at low cost. Another device was designed for focused ultrasound surgery (FUS) and was used to demonstrate fundamental physics related to Sonotweezers.\n\nParticularly significant publicity was gained from the FUS device since it allowed the demonstration of a real &amp;amp;quot;sonic screwdriver&amp;amp;quot; able to lift and rotate an object simultaneously and of an acoustic &amp;amp;quot;tractor beam&amp;amp;quot; able to pull object towards itself without contact. Our findings demonstrated that Sonotweezers can control the position of unlabelled particles and biological cells in agglomerates and with sizes larger than can be controlled with many other techniques and over length scales larger than many techniques. It is likely that applications with these characteristics exist; indeed, several smaller projects sprang from the Sonotweezers programme, are still under way, for example at the Universities of Bristol, Glasgow and Southampton, and may be expected to develop significantly in future.
