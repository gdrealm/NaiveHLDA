However, biological age can be very different from what is measured in years and days. Everyone knows that some people are ?young for their age?, while others age much faster than suggested by their years. Genes, environmental factors and chance together cause these differences. This tells us two important things: First, ageing is malleable, it is possible to intervene and to slow down human ageing. Secondly, such intervention will not only increase lifespan, but will most probably also postpone the occurrence of major diseases. \nThe problem with interventions into the ageing process is that their efficiency is very hard to measure. One cannot wait for the death of a person to decide whether a certain combination of nutrients and vitamins was good in slowing down ageing. For that, biomarkers are needed, physical parameters that can be measured today but will tell us not only how old this person is biologically but also how fast he or she will age over, say, the next 10 years. In recent years, improved understanding of the biology of ageing has led to the identification of a number of candidate biomakers of ageing. However, in order to see whether they are really good enough, they need to be tested on large numbers of people of different ages, they need to be tested in combination with each other, and they need to be tested longitudinally, that means we need to know how they change as an individual ages. We propose to do these tests, and we hope to come up with a combination of markers that will improve prediction of risk for major age-related diseases and thus allow early assessment of the efficiency of preventive interventions.\nFindings from our research will be vigorously disseminated through contacts with NHS and other stakeholder groups, including older persons? action groups, as represented in the North East Forum on Ageing (?Years Ahead?), and beyond. Findings will also be disseminated through conventional academic publications, conference presentations, web site, other media (as appropriate), and via our networks of collaborators.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0601333","grantId":"G0601333","fundValue":"608568","fundStart":"2007-11-01","fundEnd":"2011-07-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Thomas  Von Zglinicki","coPersons":["John Dudley Isaacs","Mark Stephen Pearce","Robin  Henderson","Diana Jane Kuh"],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
