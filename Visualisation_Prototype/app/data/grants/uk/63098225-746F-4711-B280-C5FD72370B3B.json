We then evaluated FOI's performance against these objectives. Key empirical findings o Local government in England was already very open, but FOI has helped further to increase transparency. o Some local authorities are more open than others due to stronger leadership, greater political stability and better media relations o FOI has also increased accountability, often helped by the local media or NGOs. o It has only marginally improved decision-making and public understanding. o FOI has not increased or decreased trust in local government. Trust is influenced by performance and 'community visibility' rather than openness. o FOI has not affected how local government works in terms of leadership or service delivery. Theory The project has further developed theory by o Systematically analysing the objectives of FOI o Understanding how FOI is used to access 'everyday' and 'micro political' information o Analysing the factors that make similar institutions more or less open Methods o The project used five main research methods (survey of local authorities; interviews; survey of FOI requesters; analysis of FOI stories in local media; analysis of disclosure logs). We conducted new analysis of disclosure logs to examine the specificity of FOI requests - a key to understanding how FOI works. Development of new networks o The project extended the 'FOI community' of academics, practitioners and scholars and disseminated findings internationally. \nPlease outline the findings and outputs from your project which have had the scientific impact(s)\n FOI tends uncritically to be assumed to be a 'good thing'. Most writing on FOI is partial, and much of it is anecdotal. Our project was the first comprehensive and rigorous study of FOI in local government, analysing its impact by reference to its main objectives. We explained our conceptual approach, our research methods and our findings through our final report B Worthy, J Amos, R Hazell and G Bourke. Town Hall Transparency? The Impact of Freedom of Information on Local Government in England. 50 pp. ISBN: 978-1-903903-62-9 Constitution Unit, December 2011. And the following academic presentations: o Conference paper for the first global transparency conference (Newark, New Jersey) o Worthy, Ben (2011) 'Does FOI work? The Impact of FOI on Central and Local Government in England'. Paper for the 1st International Global Transparency conference at Rutgers, May 2011 o Conference paper for the regional transparency workshop (Utrecht, Netherlands) o Worthy, Ben conference paper co-written with Stephan Grimmelijkhausen comparing transparency and trust in the UK and Netherlands, June 2012 o Presentations to a selection of academic groups from across disciplines and specialisms in the UK: o Government Information Seminar series 26th October 2010 (UCL) political scientists, lawyers and local government experts o Archives Society 11th October 2011 University of London (also podcast) specialist archivist group o Transparency and Corruption Network 3rd November 2011, University of Oxford (also podcast) concerned with role of transparency in preventing corruption See also the three forthcoming academic articles in Section 3C. \nPlease outline how these impacts were achieved\n Presentations o We gave a wide range of conference and seminar presentations to academic groups in the UK and elsewhere. A number were podcast, with presentations placed on our website Online dissemination and networks o We used our dedicated web pages for the project to post the conference papers, reports and summaries of our project: see http://www.ucl.ac.uk/constitution-unit/research/foi/foi-and-local-government o We used the list server FOIAnet to publicise our work (international network for FOI advocates and practitioners which includes many academics) o We used email updates to growing number of academics and practitioners who were part of the bi-monthly FOI community email list created during the project o We used our own blog to post updates on interesting parts of the project, podcasts of presentations, and wrote blogs for others such as LSE. o The Constitution Unit news letter was used to update its 4000 subscribers about the project. \nPlease outline who the findings and outputs had an impact upon\n Specific researchers and academics o Specific academics discussed our findings with us including Alon Peled (Tel Aviv) Suzanne Piotrowksi (Newark) Maeve Mcdonagh (University College Cork) Stephan Grimmeljikhausen (Utrecht) o More than 50 academics at the first global transparency conference in 2011, for which Ben Worthy was on the organising committee o Discussed our project at our annual transparency workshop at UCL in 2011, with a group of 10 academics from the UK and overseas o Academics attending our Government Information Policy seminar in 2010. Wider Groups o Transparency community: Our work was also disseminated to the broader transparency community both in UK and across the world through new networks developed through FOI community email and use of FOIAnet and our own blog o Local Government: our Advisory Committee for the project meant work was also passed to leading academics in local government including Gerry Stoker (Southampton), Tony Travers (LSE), Chris Game (Birmingham) and George Jones (LSE) \nPlease summarise below the economic and societal impact(s) your project has had\n The project has led to a more realistic understanding of what FOI can, and cannot achieve. FOI has achieved its primary aims, of increasing transparency and accountability. But it has had only marginal effects on better decision making, or better public understanding; and it has not increased public participation, or public trust. The government and Parliament have accepted those conclusions in their Post-legislative Scrutiny of FOI (see below). We also developed better information about the costs of FOI, through our annual survey of local authorities. This showed that while the number of requests increased from 60,000 in 2005 to 200,000 in 2010, the average time per request had gone down from 16 to 6 hours, so the totalcost to local government went from ?25m to ?32m. Another cost of FOI is its potential chilling effect. This can take three forms: reduction in the frankness of official advice; in the quality of the official record; and in the supply of information to local government. We concluded that when information is not properly recorded or shared, it is generally due to factors other than FOI, such as fear of leaks, or changes in local authority record keeping. Again, government and Parliament adopted our analysis of FOI's chilling effect. Finally, we found FOI requests are often in pursuit of private interests (eg neighbour's planning application; parking tickets in one street). This cannot be satisfied by more proactive publication, because local authorities cannot anticipate the particularity of such requests. \nPlease outline the findings and outputs from your project which have had the economic and societal impact(s)\n These findings were disseminated in the following outputs: Final Report Town Hall Transparency?

The Committee's report of July 2012 contained over 40 mentions of our work. They adopted our conceptual approach, and we provided much of the evidence cited for their conclusions. We also presented our findings to o UK Ministry of Justice, who mentioned our work over 30 times in the Government Memorandum for the Post-legislative scrutiny into FOI o The Information Commissioners' Office sub-group on local government (March 2011) o DCLG's transparency team on 15th December 2011 o Local Government Association o Ben Worthy spoke to the Canadian parliamentary committee on access to information (9th March 2011) o Presented to the Mozambique fourth commission looking into FOI as they prepared their own FOI bill (Nov 2011); and Ukrainian delegation (Apr 2012) Our work has also been used by local authorities in their own internal assessments of FOI. We have been quoted in reports by: o Canterbury City Council o East Devon district council o Stockport City Council o Association of Greater Manchester Authorities. Practitioners o Presentations to key groups including FOI officers, monitoring officers, data protection officers and wider practitioners o Summary of findings sent out with the 2010 survey results to all FOI officers in England o Seven articles in the Local Government Chronicle (with Ben Worthy becoming an expert contributor) o Two articles in Local Government Lawyer o Local government think tanks including Localis and the Local Government Information Unit o Users of FOI including NGOs, advocates and journalists (including the BBC and Huffington Post): see http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/dr-jonathan-carrwest/what-impact-has-foi-had-o_b_1153066.html and http://www.foiman.com/?s=constitution+unit ) \nUnexpected Impacts\n Post Legislative Scrutiny of FOI We had not anticipated the timing of the Justice Committee's post-legislative review of the operation of FOI. This was an unexpected bonus. It enabled us to feed in all our project findings, which were extensively cited in the Government's Memorandum and the Committee's report. Open Data Initiative o Around a year into the project the new coalition government announced radical new proposals for local government transparency. The centrepiece was the itemised publication of all local authority spending above ?500 by January 2011. o As this was a key reform, linking the two areas of FOI and open data which have been increasingly merging, it was important to look into this. Consequently we o Added questions to our interviews o Asked in our 2011 survey extra questions about how it was working This also led to more outputs o An academic article on Open Data including discussion of the ?500 publication scheme o A practitioner article for the Local Government Chronicle on its impact and a blog post o Presentation to the DCLG International Impact o The fact that this was the first systematic study of FOI at sub-national level and it also looked at the emerging Open Data reforms meant it attracted interest internationally. This included presentations to o Canadian Parliamentary committee on access to information (March 2011 ) o Mozambique 4th commission on FOI (House of Commons, Nov 2011). o Ukrainian Parliamentary delegation (House of Commons, Apr 2012) o Sending our findings to transparency team at World Bank. \nPotential Future Impacts\n Future academic impact Publication of academic articles to a broad range of academics including those working in the area of local government, transparency, technology and policy analysis o Worthy, Ben (forthcoming) 'Institutionalising Distrust? The Impact of Transparency on Public Trust' (to be submitted to Political Behaviour August 2012). o Worthy, Ben and Hazell, Robert (forthcoming) 'Does FOI work? The Impact of FOI on Local Government in England' (submitted to Journal of Comparative Policy Analysis May 2012). o Worthy, Ben (with Stephan Grimmelijkhausen) conference paper comparing transparency and trust in the UK and Netherlands, June 2012 o Worthy, Ben (forthcoming) 'The Impact of Open Data Projects: Cautionary Lessons from Other Transparency Experiments' (to be submitted to Policy and Internet September 2012) Future Practitioner Impact o The government is yet to respond to the Justice Committee's report, which used many of our findings and conclusions. o Ben Worthy continues to write regularly for the Local Government Chronicle on these issues.
