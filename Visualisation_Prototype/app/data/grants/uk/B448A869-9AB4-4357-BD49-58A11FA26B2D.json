We have shown that reproduction in fish living in many UK Rivers, most notably in the roach, a common member of the carp family of fish, has been damaged by exposure to chemicals contained in the WWTW effluents that disrupt the body's sex hormone systems. The chemicals identified responsible for these effects were oestrogens (female sex hormone) and included natural oestrogen hormones, pharmaceutical oestrogens taken by women as part of the contraceptive pill, and some industrial chemicals similar in their structure to natural oestrogens. The presence of feminised fish in the wild is of concern because we have shown that they have a reduced capacity to breed and this may potentially lead to adverse effects for the population and impact the ecosystem more widely. Disorders in human reproductive health occur that are very similar in nature to effects seen in wild fish and some of these effects have been associated with exposure to oestrogens. Adding further concern about WWTW effluents in UK Rivers, long term exposures of fish have found additional adverse health effects including disruption to the immune system and genetic damage. This project seeks to investigate the likely consequences of exposure to oestrogenic WWTW effluents for the sustainability of fish populations living in UK Rivers, using the roach as sentinel species. Although the roach is common in many polluted water systems, this can sometimes give misleading impressions of the health of the population. Arguably, it is better to count the number of breeding individuals in a population rather than the total number of fish because fish populations with low numbers of breeding fish have low genetic variation and inbreeding and may even be at risk of extinction. Given the results of our experiments performed to date, we think that populations of roach from more polluted sites will have smaller numbers of breeding individuals and will be more inbred than those from clean sites, because a higher proportion of fish will be unable to breed. To investigate this we will first make assessments on the ability of roach to breed in in groups that include fish that have been exposed throughout their whole lives to an oestrogenic WWTW effluent and fish that have been maintained throughout their lives in clean water. We will use a genetic technique (DNA microsatellites) to identify the parents of the offspring produced and in turn determine the reproductive success of individual fish in the competing groups and try to relate this success to their sexual physiology. We will then conduct experiments to investigate how exposure to the oestrogenic WWTW effluent over one and two generations impacts the development of the testes and ovaries and consequent breeding success in the second generation. In the final part of this project we will investigate the underlying genetic health of wild roach populations in UK Rivers using DNA microsatellites for populations collected from rivers sites with different levels of pollution with oestrogenic WWTW effluent. Ultimately, our results will enable us to assess the implications of life long exposure to oestrogenic WWTW effluents on both individuals and populations, advancing significantly knowledge on how the sustainability of roach populations in UK Rivers may be impacted. This work is intended to greatly improve the assessment of the health impacts of exposure to complex mixtures of chemical discharges on fish populations in the natural environment for the better protection of our aquatic resources and biodiversity. The work will have importance in the regulation of discharges and thus is of very wide interest to the government regulatory bodies, environment protection groups, industry and the wider public.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/G02037X/1","grantId":"NE/G02037X/1","fundValue":"180602","fundStart":"2010-01-04","fundEnd":"2013-01-03","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  The issues relating to the feminising effects on fish of wastewater treatment works (WwTW) effluents enter our rivers has been studied by our group at Brunel University and our collaborators at Exeter University for a number of years.\n\nWe now know estrogenic wastewaters entering our rivers have implications to fish reproduction. individual male fish can be feminised, which can compromise reproductive output. At high levels this can result in complete feminisation and significantly affect their contribution to the next generation. \n\nBecause of the risk to wild fish the UK Environment Agency and the Water industry have run a demonstration programme to evaluate technologies to improve effluents and remove estrogens in order to protect wildlife. Some of the technologies tested were effective at removing the estrogens and their effects on fish. However, the technologies tested were also found to be extremely costly both financially and in terms of carbon use. Therefore there is a need to fully understand the risk posed, to make sure any investments in improving effluents are cost effective. \n\ndue to our research finding over the last few decades and of other researcher in the field, 17-beta-estrdiol (natural steroid estrogen) and ethinylestradiol (contraceptive pill hormone) are on an EU watch list within the Water Framework Directive. This means countries across Europe will need to monitor the levels of these compounds in receiving waters, with the intention of fully characterising the concentration(s) and therefore the risk these compounds might pose to wild fish.

First we set out to determine the effects of life-long exposure to an estrogenic WwTW effluent on the reproductive capabilities of roach. We had already established that reproductive failure occurs after chronic exposure of roach to an estrogenic WwTW effluent for up to 3.5 years. To understand the reasons for this reproductive failure we assessed the gonad development of the fish in the breeding colonies that included both WwTW exposed and unexposed &quot;control&quot; fish. Histological analysis of the gonads demonstrated that all fish exposed to 100% effluent for 3 years were females. Using this analysis two types of female were found; those that looked like normal females (i.e. full sexually mature) and those that seemed to not have developed normally and were considered to possibly be sex-reversed males. Using a technique called DNA microsatellite analysis we conducted parentage analysis of the offspring of fish from all our breeding colonies to determine their reproductive capacity, i.e. how many of the off-spring came from each adult fish. We found that presumptive females exposed to sexual maturity to WwTW effluent bred normally, but putative sex-reversed males breeding as females contributed poorly, if at all. The results of this study indicate that exposure to WwTW effluents can have substantial impacts on breeding capabilities, with likely implications at a population level (Environ. Sci. Technol. 2011, 45, 1673-1679). \nWe then investigated evidence for trans-generational effects by exposing their offspring to either 100% effluent or 100% water. Gonadal histology was examined after 3 years (160 fish) and again at 3 years and 9 months (36 fish). We found no evidence for endocrine disruption in males kept in water, whether the maternal parent was exposed or not. Analysis of the gonads of males exposed to 100% effluent, revealed various degrees of feminisation, confirming estrogenicity of the effluent; no differences between fish with effluent-exposed or water-exposed mothers were found. Surprisingly the majority of feminised male fish had only a few oocytes per gonadal section, in contrast to the all-female population from the previous exposure. Chemical analysis on the effluent demonstrated that ammonia levels were substantially lower during the period of the second exposure and concentrations of steroidal estrogens were also lower, a likely consequence of improvements to the WwTW works undertaken during the second exposure. In order to evaluate the effects of maternal exposure to a WwTW effluent on reproductive competitiveness of the offspring, we conducted a breeding study using the 160 fish at the end of the 3rd year, with two breeding scenarios in 8 tanks. Parentage analysis revealed no difference in reproductive success between fish with either effluent exposed or control mothers. \nOur final objective was to test for evidence of reduced genetic variation in populations of wild roach inhabiting rivers contaminated with estrogenic WwTW effluents. We genotyped a total of 1769 fish from 32 river sites predominantly in the region of the Thames catchment. Analysis of population structure demonstrated that some populations have been confined to some of the most contaminated river stretches over multiple generations, mainly due to barriers to migration such as weirs, and have therefore not been sustained by immigration (movement of fish from other stretches of river). We found no evidence that size of breeding populations or genetic diversity was reduced in more contaminated rivers. There was, however, evidence for less variation in breeding populations from the more effluent contaminated rivers, and a 65% reduction at for the most contaminated sites could not be ruled out. These results suggest that roach living in some effluent-contaminated river stretches where feminization is widespread are still self-sustaining (BMC Biology 2014 12:1).  Environment","dataset":"gtr"}
