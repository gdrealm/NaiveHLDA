{"id":"B9BED147-74B0-4A2A-BECE-E97C0486F928","title":"Invisible Worlds - Making the Invisible Visible","abstractText":"Our project aims to provide an engaging, awe-inspiring interaction with science for a large, general public audience.\nThrough an exhibition of large-scale, high-impact images in the city centre of Edinburgh, it will showcase the ways in which advances in science and technology can – through cutting-edge imagery techniques – reveal some of the wonderful sights normally hidden to us. Free, open and accessible, the exhibition will provide a valuable platform for reaching new audiences.\nIt will form a valuable part of our continued attempts to make science and technology easily accessible to those not necessarily engaged with, or targeted by, most traditional science communication activity. It will showcase some of the vastness, complexity and beauty of science in fields such as biomedical imaging and astronomy. In doing so it will draw attention to the techniques, technologies and research that make it possible to glimpse these otherwise invisible worlds.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/J501505/1","grantId":"ST/J501505/1","fundValue":"10000","fundStart":"2011-12-25","fundEnd":"2012-03-24","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Amanda  Tyndall","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Edinburgh International Science Festival","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
