{"id":"A68FCA7B-CE99-47C6-9738-C7F8FDE1EC62","title":"Sandpit: Cyberplasm","abstractText":"The aim of this proposal is to construct Cyberplasm, a micro-scale robot using principles of synthetic biology. This will be accomplished using a combination of advanced microelectronics and biomimicry; an approach that mimics animal models; in the latter we will imitate some of the behavior of the marine animal the sea lamprey. Synthetic muscle will propel the robot through liquid. Synthetic sensors derived from yeast cells will be reporting signals from the immediate environment. These signals will be processed by an electronic nervous system. The electronic brain will, in turn, generate signals to drive the muscle cells that will use glucose for energy. All electronic components will be powered by a microbial fuel cell integrated into the robot body.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H019081/1","grantId":"EP/H019081/1","fundValue":"298311","fundStart":"2009-11-01","fundEnd":"2012-10-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Daniel Joseph Frankel","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
