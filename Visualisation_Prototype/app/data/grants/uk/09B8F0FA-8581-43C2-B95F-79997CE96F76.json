Our original AHRC-funded research explored the interplay between counselling, psychotherapy and religion in Scotland from 1945-2000. The stories that emerged are little known by contemporary practitioners. Key findings include the influence of religious thought on significant Scottish psychotherapeutic thinkers and the importance of churches and church figures in founding many of the counselling and psychotherapy services currently perceived as secular.\n\nOne of the objectives for our original project was to engage in dialogue with a professional audience of psychotherapists, counsellors, clergy, and pastoral workers through two internally hosted conferences and a series of external events hosted by non-academic bodies. We were successful in achieving this objective, attracting a large number of practitioners from a range of faiths (and of no faith) to our presentations. However, our achievements in this area and the feedback we received merely highlighted the extent of the unmet demand for engaging in dialogue on these issues. Practitioners mentioned two main reasons for their interest in our project:\n\n1) counsellors and psychotherapists reported a lack of opportunities to discuss issues of faith with peers. In addition, they frequently mentioned some hesitation in bringing up faith in professional contexts.\n\n2) members of faith communities reported a lack of opportunities to discuss the interface and overlap between pastoral care, spiritual direction, spiritual counselling, counselling and psychotherapy.\n\nOur readers' theatre workshops will provide opportunities for members of these communities, as well as for interested members of the general public, to engage in such discussions in a creative and supportive environment. Through partnering with COSCA (Counselling and Psychotherapy in Scotland), The British Association of Counselling and Psychotherapy and the Scottish Inter Faith Council, we will reach practitioners who would be unlikely to come to the sorts of research events at which academics typically present their findings. By engaging in dialogue around these issues we will expand our own knowledge about the roles faith and spirituality play in the lives and professional practices of contemporary practitioners.\n\nReaders' theatre entails &quot;the coming together of two or more people to engage in the reading aloud and simultaneous listening of a conversation that has been scripted&quot; (Cueva 2010, 3). It has been used to engage the public in dialogue on ethics, and to stimulate discussion on difficult or taboo subjects. In our project, in partnership with the Scottish Storytelling Centre, we will develop thirty-minute scripts using our archival and life history interview research. At our workshops, participants will be invited to read these scripts aloud, this will be followed by a discussion on the issues mentioned above. We will also produce an &quot;exhibition&quot; at St Mungo Museum of Religion and Society, enabling members of the public to engage in spontaneous readings of the scripts and to record their responses. Scripts will also be made available on-line through our website: www.theologyandtherapy.div.ed.ac.uk\n\nWe anticipate this project will extend the pathways to impact of our original findings, meet unmet needs in practitioner communities and deepen our understandings of how knowledge exchange might be done creatively in a way that respects the narrative nature of our original research data and invites participants to engage empathetically with view points that may differ significantly from their own.\n\nCueva, M (2010) Readers' Theatre as Cancer Education: An Organic Inquiry in Alaska Awakening Possibilities in a Living Spiral of Understanding.
