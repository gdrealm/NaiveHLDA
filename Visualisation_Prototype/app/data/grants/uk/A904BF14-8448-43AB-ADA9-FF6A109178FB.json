{"id":"A904BF14-8448-43AB-ADA9-FF6A109178FB","title":"The Forgotten Holocaust: The Nazi persecution of the Sinti and Roma and its aftermath","abstractText":"The persecution and attempted genocide of the Sinti, Roma and Gypsies was for long a forgotten aspect of the Nazi attempt to create an ethnically pure 'folk community.' The book I am finishing writing describes the particular institutional and ideological pressures that led the Nazi state, despite Hitler's lack of interest in the question, to kill over 100,000 Gypsies. The murder of Sinte, Roma and other Gypsies took place without there ever being a specific or formulated genocidal intent.\n This work argues, therefore, for a revision of both popular understanding and international law (the genocide convention). \nThe post-Wannsee, Holocaust model of genocide is an obstacle both to understanding other historical genocides and to recognising genocide as it occurs today in our world.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=113181/1","grantId":"113181/1","fundValue":"15301","fundStart":"2006-04-10","fundEnd":"2006-08-09","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael Sinclair Stewart","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
