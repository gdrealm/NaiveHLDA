The UK is home to more than sixteen major ethnic groups from sixty major countries and there is currently an ongoing public debate as to how this demographic change will affect the way of living in the UK.</p>\n\n<p>This project aims to understand how social diversity affects contributions to a public good. In particular, it proposes to study how public good contributions change as the degree of heterogeneity in a population changes. This question is tackled using laboratory experiments. The primary research question is: how does an individual's decision to contribute to a public good change as the relative size of her social group in the population changes?</p>\n\n<p>This project makes an important contribution to the literature on social dilemmas and the literature on social identity. Its findings will be relevant to economists, psychologists and political scientists alike. In addition, it touches on policy-relevant issues. What are the consequences of a multi-cultural society on public good provision? Is it crucial for a society for there to be a super-ordinate identity, which subsumes all others, or is a society, which encompasses a kaleidoscope of different identities equally apt at providing public goods </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-3941","grantId":"RES-000-22-3941","fundValue":"25618","fundStart":"2010-04-01","fundEnd":"2012-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  We hope that our research has increased awareness by academics and policy-makers of the issue of social diversity on economic performance and the advantages of using experimental methods in order to complement &quot;traditional&quot; research methods used by development economists.\n\nIn particular, our findings have led to the establishment of a research partnership between the University of Exeter Business School and the Centre for Studies in Social Sciences at Kolkata, with the support of the state government of West Bengal, India to study the impact of religious diversity on economic performance.\n\nThis ESRC/DfID-funded project combines traditional surveys with field experiments, and will generate academic articles and policy-oriented reports.

Public good provision in our experiment was systematically affected by the introduction of different social groups, even though the nature of these groups was irrelevant to the actual task being performed by participants.\n\nIncreasing social fragmentation leads to lower public good provision. This evidence is in line with existing evidence from the field, and highlights the importance of social identity in explaining the negative relationship between social fragmentation and economic performance.\n\nAs social fragmentation increases, people who make full contributions decreases, but the proportion of people who free ride or contribute nothing remains the same. Public good contributions decline as social fragmentation increases because the latter leads to disenfranchisement with their identity rather than self-serving behaviour.\n\nA small amount of social fragmentation can lead to increase in contribution in comparison to completely homogenous groups. This is the most surprising finding of our project: there is an optimal level of (positive) diversity.\n\nIf individuals have the opportunity to contribute to club goods in addition to public goods, then they choose to contribute to club goods even if the monetary benefit from contributions to public good is higher. This project was designed to study the impact of social identity on behaviour using artificial groups. Therefore its findings are best used for the conceptual insights they bring, rather than for direct policy recommendations. \n\nWe envisaged this project would be most useful as a precursor to more applied research. Indeed, our findings have led to the design and development of a field experiment on religious fragmentation and its impact of behaviour in West Bengal in collaboration with the Centre for Studies in the Social Sciences in Kolkata, India.
