This programme of research is based on our new attentional control theory. According to this theory, anxiety impairs attentional control, which has two main consequences: (1) it is more difficult to shift attention as required by changing task demands; and (2) it is more difficult to avoid attending to distracting stimuli that are irrelevant to the task being performed. </p>\n\n<p>An additional feature of the theory is that it is assumed that anxious individuals will typically respond to impaired attentional control by trying to regain control by making use of additional processing resources. As a result, anxiety often has a greater adverse effect on efficiency (performance divided by the processing resources used) than it does on performance itself. There is already research indicating the key role of attention in determining the various effects of anxiety, but the research programme is designed to identify more precisely the component processes involved. The findings should be of direct relevance in education (eg, understanding the adverse effects of anxiety on learning and on examination performance).</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-23-1529","grantId":"RES-000-23-1529","fundValue":"170188","fundStart":"2006-06-12","fundEnd":"2008-06-11","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"MICHAEL WILLIAM EYSENCK","coPersons":["Nazanin  Derakshan"],"organisation":"Royal Holloway, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
