{"id":"77537CBD-3A8F-4199-AF79-A763CA2D3A75","title":"Precision guidance: Mechanisms driving targeted secretion in response to invasive microbes","abstractText":"Plant cells are surrounded by a plasma membrane (PM) that spans tens of thousands of square microns. Pattern recognition receptors in the PM detect microbial molecules and molecules associated with cell wall damage that may indicate the presence of a pathogen. This information is transduced to activate defensive processes including the production of new proteins and compounds that are then transported back to the site of contact. Recently it was discovered that molecular patterns are sufficient to guide the precise delivery of cargoes effectively allowing the plant cell to change the content of the PM and the cell wall at the site of phytopathogen contact hours before a phytopathogen physically penetrates the host cell wall. This proposal aims to answer the fundamental question of how these cargoes are delivered to only a few specific square microns of PM in the vicinity of the pathogen. \n\nOur preliminary data show that the induction of exocytosis (the process of transporting and delivering material to the PM and cell exterior) by fungal phytopathogen-associated molecules is an excellent system for monitoring plant exocytosis in 'real time'. We have established an assay using Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy that allows controlled stimulation of exocytosis and visualisation of the interaction of vesicles (small 'packets' of membrane and internal cargo) with the PM. We have shown that PEN3 and other proteins of interest are clustered into stable 'nano domains': sub-domains of the plasma membrane at the nano-metre scale. These nano domains are too small to be fully resolved by standard light microscopy. We also observe mobile vesicles 'touring' PM nano domains. This proposal seeks to understand how these behaviours lead to the emergence of specialised PM zones precisely beneath the site of microbial contact.\n\nTo do this we will combine two areas of expertise: plant cell biology and optical physics. Our team includes a laboratory responsible for several innovations in the field of 'super' resolution microscopy. These super resolution techniques, dSTORM and PALM can increase optical resolution to an order of magnitude greater than standard fluorescence microscopy. This will enable accurate assessment of protein co-localisation and interactions with PM nano domains. \n\nIn the first part of our study we will use TIRF microscopy and super resolution microscopy to ask whether the 'touring' behaviours of vesicles and their pausing at nano domains results in the transfer of cargo to (or from) nano domains. We will also ask whether the cytoskeleton is anchored to nano domains in order to promote vesicle touring/pausing behaviour. In the second part we will isolate the unknown cargoes of the vesicles we are observing. This will identify novel anti-microbial factors and previously uncharacterised proteins that contribute to vesicle targeting. Finally, we will perform a functional analysis of a protein complex known as the exocyst in parallel with candidate proteins emerging from the vesicle isolation experiments. The exocyst acts as a vesicle-tethering complex in animal and fungal systems but has fundamental behavioural differences in plants. We will therefore test the hypothesis that the exocyst is part of the molecular machinery that tethers vesicles to specific sites at the PM responding to microbes. \n\nBy the completion of this inter disciplinary project we will have identified the mechanism by which cargoes are deposited selectively at PM sites in contact with microbes. We will have tested the role of both conserved and novel factors that we have isolated as candidate components of this targeting machinery, giving fundamental insights into targeted exocytosis in plants. Moreover, we will have used our tools to establish a means to deliver enzyme cargoes to the plant pathogen interface. This will underpin future efforts to apply biotechnology solutions to preventing plant disease.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/M024172/1","grantId":"BB/M024172/1","fundValue":"446067","fundStart":"2015-09-01","fundEnd":"2018-08-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael  Deeks","coPersons":["Christian  Soeller"],"organisation":"University of Exeter","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
