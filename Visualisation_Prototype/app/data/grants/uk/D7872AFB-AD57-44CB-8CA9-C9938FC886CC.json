{"id":"D7872AFB-AD57-44CB-8CA9-C9938FC886CC","title":"Politics, Finance and Growth","abstractText":"<p>Although the recent financial crisis led to suggestions that there can be too much finance, many low income countries (LIC)&nbsp; remain financially under-development.&nbsp; In Sub-Saharan Africa, banks continue to lend little domestically. Even where financial development has taken place, its effects on the poor are generally unknown. By analysing the linkages between&nbsp; politics, finance and growth in Sub-Saharan Africa, the project aims to explain how finance can help promote pro-poor economic growth in LIC.</p>\n\n<p>The project aims to analyse the causes of financial under-development using appropriate methods and data, focussing on determinants of high loan default in Sub-Saharan Africa, the role of incumbent financiers in deterring new firms’ entry and the role of natural resources on financial development.</p>\n\n<p>It also aims to re-examine key aspects of the finance-growth relationship by analysing the consequences of banks’ opportunistic behaviour on financial instability, and the effect of different types of financial reforms on bank soundness. A new measure of banking fragility constructed under the project will help determine if increased fragility explains the recent weakening of the finance-growth relationship.</p>\n\n<p>The project will explore the relationship between financial development and poverty in LIC using a range of different approaches and data.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J009067/1","grantId":"ES/J009067/1","fundValue":"286800","fundStart":"2012-09-30","fundEnd":"2016-03-29","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Svetlana  Andrianova","coPersons":["Peter L  Rousseau","Stephen George Hall","Abbi Mamo  Kedir","Thorsten  Beck","Martin  Foureaux Koppensteiner","David James  Fielding","Steven Fredric Koch","Robert  Lensink","Badi  Baltagi"],"organisation":"University of Leicester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
