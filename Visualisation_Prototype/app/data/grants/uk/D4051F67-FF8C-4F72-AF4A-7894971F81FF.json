In this study a wider range of issues will be covered, eg:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>changes in gendered (and age) patterns of phone use over time; phone use in building social networks to support job search etc</li>\n\n <li>impacts on education, employment, livelihoods and health status</li>\n\n <li>safety and surveillance</li>\n\n <li>possible connections to migration</li>\n\n <li>youth identity, image </li>\n\n <li>exploitation/empowerment questions. </li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>&nbsp;Mixed-method, participatory child-centred studies will be conducted in the same 24 sites across Ghana, Malawi and South Africa (urban, peri-urban, rural, remote rural in two agro-ecological zones per country).&nbsp; It will build on the baseline data for 9-18 year-olds through repeat and extended studies, plus additional studies with 19-25 year-olds&nbsp; (to capture changing usage and its impacts as our initial cohort move into their 20s). The country research teams will include available ‘child’ researchers from our previous study. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J018082/1","grantId":"ES/J018082/1","fundValue":"465367","fundStart":"2012-08-01","fundEnd":"2015-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  ES/J018082/1\nOur research is still in progress.
