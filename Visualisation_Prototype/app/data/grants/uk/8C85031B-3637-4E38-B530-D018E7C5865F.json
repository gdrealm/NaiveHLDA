The impact of defective DNA repair is seen in patients with the cancer-prone condition xeroderma pigmentosum, who have very high incidences of skin cancer due to being unable to remove sunlight-induced DNA damage. Simply put, un-repaired DNA damage causes mutations which contribute to the incidences of genetic defects and to cancer. Hence DNA repair is crucial to reduce the incidence of harmful mutations.\nEach microscopic cell in our body has about two metres of DNA in it, organised as chromosomes and where the DNA is wrapped up, somewhat like a ball of wool. DNA repair has to unravel this structure, repair the DNA and return it to its pre-damaged state to ensure each cell functions normally. \nWe use yeast as a model organism to study how this is achieved because it has the same DNA repair pathway as us, but with it we obtain information more quickly. With this approach we are determining the events needed to afford DNA repair access to DNA.\nThe work has implications for new predictive biomarkers for cancer risk and for devising new therapies for cancer.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G9900118","grantId":"G9900118","fundValue":"2168430","fundStart":"1999-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Ray  Waters","coPersons":["Paul James Smith"],"organisation":"University of Wales College of Medicine","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
