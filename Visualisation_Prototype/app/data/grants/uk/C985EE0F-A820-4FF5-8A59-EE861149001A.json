What shifts in the use of image, writing, layout, colour, and other modes of graphic representation can be observed? Is image becoming central in most learning resources? <br /></li> \n <li> What is it that may have been gained and what may have been lost in potentials for learning as a result of these changes? Are the changes in graphic designs leading to intended or unintended changes in what and how students can and will learn, or to changes in their control over what and how they learn?</li>\n</ul> \n<p>We aim to develop a clear characterization of graphic designs in these materials and their differential learning potentials, with a view both to researchers and to those involved in the production, use and evaluation of learning resources. We will collect and analyze a wide range of learning resources, covering three curriculum subjects, English, Science and Mathematics. The data base will include secondary school textbooks and electronic (‘multimedia’) learning resources published between 1930 and the present. The study uses a social semiotic approach to multimodal representation and communication.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-0224","grantId":"RES-062-23-0224","fundValue":"167825","fundStart":"2007-01-01","fundEnd":"2009-07-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Gunther  Kress","coPersons":["Jeff  Bezemer"],"organisation":"Institute of Education","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
