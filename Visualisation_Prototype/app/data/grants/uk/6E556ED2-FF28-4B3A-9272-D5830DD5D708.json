While it is often taken for granted that there are silences at museums and historic sites, the processes by which they operate have been less explicitly conceptualised. This network will make a distinction between 'being silenced' and 'being silent' in order to look at the ways in which histories perceived as challenging or 'difficult' are conveyed and taught by education officers in museums and at historic sites. As part of such teaching, museums and historic sites now frequently employ strategies of empathy to confront difficult pasts. The network will draw on the body of work about empathy and issues of accessibility in order to interrogate the ways in which empathy is being identified in the generic learning outcomes.\\n\\nThe network will bring together academics, early career researchers, doctoral students, curators, and educators to work in a genuinely interdisciplinary way. The diversity of expertise within the network will facilitate a focus on different cultural conceptions of silence and empathy and the way that such understandings are (or are not) part of dominant understandings of memory. The collaboration of academics and practitioners will promote an understanding of how silence, empathy and memory interact in museums and at historic sites. The findings will be of significance for museum and heritage site professionals, policy makers and educators across the sectors. \\n\\nThe network will run three workshops and one conference at the University of Birmingham, City University, the Historic Royal Palaces Tower of London, and Buckfast Abbey respectively. These meetings will be structured to promote dialogue, collaboration and progression of the fields. \\nThe network will maintain a website and blog throughout its duration to strengthen the exchange of ideas, report back on the workshops, maintain the impetus beyond the life of the initial project, and attract interest more widely from the constituencies of the members. The steering group will also disseminate the results via a website, blog, training day for educators, conference papers, co-authored articles, and special issue of a journal. \\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/I022430/1","grantId":"AH/I022430/1","fundValue":"21495","fundStart":"2012-01-01","fundEnd":"2013-12-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  Further in-depth qualitative and quantitative work on the impact of the project on institutions (museums and heritage sites) of network members is still to be carried out, supported by institutional leave from the University of Birmingham.

It has investigated the processes of silence, silencing and agency in diverse geographical, musealogical and heritage contexts. \no The network has begun work on linking the processes of silence to the role of empathy in museums, work which is continuing via the publications arising from the conference.\no A website and blog have had 10,524 views since the launch, from 98 countries. The website continues to get 20 to 60 views a week. The blog was set up to be outward facing, informing all those interested in the activities of the group, and the links members were making to wider debates about the central themes (including links to popular culture and news stories). A few prolific posters kept momentum on the blog, and were rewarded with high numbers of views. The workshops, and particularly workshop 3, indicated that there was still much work to be done on the transmedia museum. While this practice is already established to a certain extent in the heritage context (see https://silencememoryempathy.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/cardiff-transmedia-drago.pdf), there is still work to be done on theorising the processes at work.
