International Security Institutions and Informal Groups of States","abstractText":"<p>At the beginning of the 21st Century, we live in an era of global interdependence where threats and challenges are interconnected, and where members of international society share the interest and the responsibility to address problems collectively and effectively. Multilateral security institutions are in high demand as they provide platforms to mobilise and coordinate collective action. Yet, their problem-solving capacity is rather limited and, hence, their effectiveness in global governance is sub-optimal. The proliferation of multilateral institutions has therefore been accompanied by the growing importance of informal groupings of states – eg ‘contact groups’ and ‘core groups’ – that act in and around formal institutions. Such groupings occupy a vital space between multilateral governance on the one hand and traditional major power diplomacy on the other. However they have not been subjected to sustained or rigorous analysis. This project will allow opening up and developing a new research agenda involving cross-institutional and cross-regional comparison of the dynamics between informal groups of states and multilateral security institutions in the management of risk and conflict. It explores the conditions under which the relationship between international security institutions and informal groups may be mutually reinforcing.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E00122X/1","grantId":"ES/E00122X/1","fundValue":"157315","fundStart":"2007-01-01","fundEnd":"2010-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Jochen  Prantl","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
