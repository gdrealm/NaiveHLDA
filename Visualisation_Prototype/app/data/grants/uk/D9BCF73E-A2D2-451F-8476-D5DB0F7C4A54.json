Most languages display considerable flexibility in how to achieve this. </p>\n\n<p>In English, the choice between active and passive voice is an important contributor to this kind of flexibility. While many linguistic theories assume that passives serve distinct semantic and pragmatic functions in expressing a target message, related psycholinguistic research is extremely sparse to date. </p>\n\n<p>The goal of this project is to conduct a thorough empirical investigation of the factors that may promote the use of passive voice sentences, and more specifically, of the various forms that a passive can take&nbsp;- amongst other things, English supports two different passive forms as in &quot;Mary was left at the altar&quot; versus &quot;Mary got left at the altar&quot;, for example.</p>\n\n<p>The proposed research will rely on a variety of state-of-the-art methodologies, including large-scale corpus analyses and psycholinguistic experimentation. One series of experiments will focus on sentence production, employing experimental techniques such as picture description, sentence paraphrasing, and syntactic priming. A second will investigate moment-by-moment sentence comprehension based on various eye-tracking methodologies. The results will be highly useful in developing a comprehensive functional account of passivisation in English.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-2009","grantId":"RES-062-23-2009","fundValue":"280143","fundStart":"2009-11-01","fundEnd":"2012-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  Apart from scientific impacts, we are not aware of economical or societal impacts of this project so far.

(1) While showing remarkable consistency across regional variants (British versus American English) and modality (spoken vs. written language), the use of different passive-forms (get or be, with or without optional by-phrase) is constrained by the notional verb and its meaning: verbs form clusters of syntactically similar predicates (in terms of how frequently they appear in the different passive forms) which also tend to be semantically similar. (2) Get- and be-passives serve distinct pragmatic functions, as reflected in the fact that be-passives are more likely to be produced when the Patient is the discourse topic, and get-passives are more likely when the Patient is highlighted. (3) Core syntactic features of the passive are shared across different forms, as predicted by our novel pvP Theory of the English passive. The findings have implications for the relationship between meaning and linguistic form, e.g. which form of transitive description (active, be-passive or get-passive) is most appropriate to express or emphasize certain meanings (importance or prominence of the Undergoer of an event). As such, the findings may have implications for language education (adjusting normative grammar to actual language use) and natural-language communication technology.
