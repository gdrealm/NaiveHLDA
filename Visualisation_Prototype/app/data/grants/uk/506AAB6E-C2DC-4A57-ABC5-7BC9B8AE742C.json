We plan to investigate whether the human immunity to tuberculosis as a result of BCG vaccination is different after individuals complete treatment for latent TB. This will allow us to test whether BCG can protect individuals following clearance of the tuberculosis bacterium. We would develop a partnership between UK and Brazilian researchers to undertake the following: \n\nReview and summarise any published studies of BCG assessing protection after treatment for latent TB. We will use this information and expert views to try and quantify the impact of vaccinating people after TB treatment.\n\nWe would organise two workshops, one in Brazil and one in the UK that strengthen the existing collaboration between partners. We will use these workshops to develop our pilot study and to plan the grant application for a major trial. We would ensure there are training opportunities in the UK for Brazilian students, and UK students in Brazil.\n\nWe will undertake a pilot study in Brazil to investigate the feasibility of undertaking a trial over a 6 month period. The pilot study would examine immunological changes after BCG vaccination in 40 people immediately following the completion of treatment for latent TB.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/M02654X/1","grantId":"MR/M02654X/1","fundValue":"47122","fundStart":"2015-01-01","fundEnd":"2016-08-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Ibrahim  Abubakar","coPersons":["Charlotte  Jackson","Helen Ruth Stagg","Laura Cunha  Rodrigues","Molebogeng  Rangaka"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
