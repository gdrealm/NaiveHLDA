Disruption of its function underlies a variety of different neurological disorders such as certain forms of epilepsy and mental retardation. During embryonic development the nerve cells which constitute the cortex have to form the appropriate connections with nerve cells either within or outside of the cerebral cortex enabling the cerebral cortex to communicate with other regions of the brain. In general, our research aims at identifying the fundamental mechanisms that allow neurons to make these connections. We are particularly interested in the role of the GLI3 gene which is mutated in a number of human syndromes. Such patients often suffer from mental retardation. We want to investigate the role of the Gli3 gene in the formation of appropriate connections between cortical nerve cells and their target cells in the thalamus. From this analysis, we expect further clues to our understanding of the causes underlying mental retardation in human patients.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0801359","grantId":"G0801359","fundValue":"443734","fundStart":"2009-09-15","fundEnd":"2012-09-14","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Thomas  Theil","coPersons":["David  Price"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
