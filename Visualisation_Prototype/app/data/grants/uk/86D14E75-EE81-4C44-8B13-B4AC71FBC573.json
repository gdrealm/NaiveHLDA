Knowledge of mass exchange between the continents and the oceans is fundamental to understanding and interpreting sea level rise. However, constraining this value has been very difficult until the launch of the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission. GRACE provides a unique global view of the motion of water across the surface of the planet. Several studies have used GRACE data to estimate the mass gain in the oceans over its lifetime (2002-present). Unfortunately, the gravity changes that GRACE measures are due not only to water entering the ocean, but also due to the ongoing motion of the solid earth caused by the last ice age, a process called glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA). In an odd coincidence, the ocean-averaged, apparent mass trend caused by GIA is nearly equal in magnitude and opposite in sign to the trend of freshwater entering the ocean from the continents. As the ocean-averaged GIA value can only be modelled, it introduces a large uncertainty to the interpretation of the ocean-averaged GRACE results.\n\nAnother independent method of measuring the mass change is to observe the change in pressure at the bottom of the ocean. The mass component of water entering the ocean spreads quickly worldwide, thus increasing bottom pressure everywhere. There are two complications, however. First, there are many dynamic processes in the ocean that also impact bottom pressure. For sea level, these dynamic changes often are much larger than the average change in sea level height caused by the water flux. For bottom pressure, though, the variation due the dynamic signals is much smaller than that of sea level, and in certain regions, such as near the equator, it is expected they may even be smaller than the pressure change due to addition of mass into the ocean. Second, the water entering the oceans does not distribute uniformly because the shifting position of the mass causes crustal motion and changes in gravity. These changes produce unique patterns of bottom pressure change, which we refer to as the static ocean response to differentiate it from the dynamic processes.\n\nThis proposal will test the hypothesis that bottom pressure measurements can provide a useful measure of the mass entering the ocean. To assess this possibility, we will complete four tasks. First, we gather existing bottom pressure data and generate bottom pressure fields from the GRACE satellite mission data. Second, we compare a number of dynamic ocean model results to gauge our knowledge of the dynamic bottom pressure signal and the variability of this measurement. Third, we will generate a number estimates of the static bottom pressure field, caused by change of water on land and the ongoing response of the earth to the last ice age, to explore the spatial and temporal variability expected due to these sources. Finally, we will combine the previous results to evaluate our ability to extract the globally-averaged mass change at the short time scales (monthly to annually) that are accessible with the available data. In addition, this task will also determine the ideal set of bottom pressure measurements that are needed to estimate the global average on longer time scales. If we find that the bottom pressure measurements are useful, we will create a proposal to the global observing systems that bottom pressure should be added as a component that complements the GRACE mission in the same manner as tide gauges complement altimetry.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/I023384/1","grantId":"NE/I023384/1","fundValue":"320741","fundStart":"2012-02-22","fundEnd":"2015-08-21","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  One or two deployments of ocean bottom pressure sensors in the equatorial central Pacific could act as supplementary system of observing changes in the ocean mass. The changing mass of the ocean is an important, integrated measurement of one of two primary components of global sea level change. As such, this observation could provide another indication of the global state of the sea level change. We are raising this possibility in international ocean observing forums, with participation at a recent NASA workshop on Green Cable Systems, which aims to instrument telecommunication cables with ocean monitoring equipment including pressure and temperature sensors.

In order to understand sea level rise, we need to be able to separate out these two effects, so how can we weigh the ocean to determine how much mass is being added? One method is to use satellite gravity measurements, but there are difficulties with this which leave some ambiguity in the result. We have shown that another, rather simple method is possible. There is a region in the equatorial central Pacific ocean where monitoring the pressure of water on the seafloor would provide a way to weigh the ocean. Using existing pressure measurements, we have determined the annual cycle of ocean mass (Hughes et al., JGR, 2012). While bottom pressure measurements from the equatorial central Pacific would be ideal, existing deployments in this region are rare. Thus, we have extended the study to look at records from 17 equatorial sites and demonstrated that method is robust and that the combination of all observations improves the estimate of the annual cycle of ocean mass (Williams et al., Ocean Sci., 2014). However, to be successful for observing the mass change over longer time scales, a new instrument will need to be developed. As part of the project, we have produced a bottom pressure data product at hourly and daily sampling from 149 deployments at 48 locations. This data is available at the Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level (PSMSL) website. One or two deployments of ocean bottom pressure sensors could act as supplementary system of observing changes in the ocean mass. This is an important, integrated measurement of sea level change. For this observation system to be effective, development of a new ocean bottom pressure sensor that is stable over long time scales is needed. In addition, the processed bottom pressure records made available at the PSMSL website will assist other researchers in other studies of ocean dynamics and tides.
