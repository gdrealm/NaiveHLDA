Charting the Impact of the Liberation Panther Party","abstractText":"<p>The entry of Dalit (ex-Untouchable) movements into Tamil political institutions in the 1990s was a major milestone, but there has been no systematic study of their impact as yet.</p>\n\n<p>This proposed ethnography of a Dalit party will offer detailed analyses of the conditions of activism and how Dalit activists and leaders negotiate institutionalisation. The project will deepen understandings of the interplay between caste and political representation and explore the potential inconsistencies between Dalit party politics and the concerns of those at the grass-roots. The Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi (VCK, Liberation Panther Party), are the most successful Dalit movement-turned-party in Tamil Nadu. Existing studies, however, have failed to capture the perceptions and actions of rank-and-file Dalit activists and voters.</p>\n\n<p>The main aim of this project is to chart the VCK’s political integration at the grass-roots level. The research will probe whether and/or how the demands and critiques of Dalit movements have been integrated into wider political discourses and practices. It will, thus, address the openness of political systems to new actors and ideas, and representation in a caste-divided society. The key methods employed will be participant observation and interviews with active and non-active Dalits and Dalit leaders, policy-makers, analysts and NGO staff.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-3348","grantId":"RES-062-23-3348","fundValue":"172101","fundStart":"2012-01-01","fundEnd":"2013-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  The research has generated debate and discussion through articles written for accessible and widely-read publications; through public lectures and conferences and through user-engagement initiatives.\nArticles published in Seminar, Economic and Political Weekly, Frontline and The Hindu have been widely circulated and discussed. I have published three op-ed pieces in The Hindu newspaper - the leading English language newspaper of record in the country - that draw on key aspects of my research. These have focused on the contentious caste 'census', on the social antecedents of caste violence and on new caste dynamics in south India. These pieces generated a series of comments and letters to the newspaper. Additionally, I co-wrote a paper on the symbolic and political significance of Ambedkar statues. This was carried in the issue of Frontline magazine - one of the most recognised current affairs outlets in India - which was launched by vice-President Hamid Ansari. I was also invited to contribute an overview of the interplay between caste and politics in Tamil Nadu for the well-respected and accessible organ of opinion and policy Seminar magazine in an issue devoted to contemporary caste dynamics. Evidence of the wider interest in the research is seen in that my papers for Seminar and The Hindu resulted in invitations for user-friendly analyses for Bheem Patrika - a Dalit journal in northern India; Manorama Yearbook - described as 'the largest selling general knowledge update in the country', and the well-known Centre Right India blog whose mission is 'to provide high-quality, independent analyses of political, social, and cultural issues that concern the Indian public and in doing so, strengthen Indian democracy'.\nK.C. Narayanan, editor of Manorama Yearbook, for example stated: 'I write this note after reading your article in today's Hindu, on the caste violence in Tamil Nadu. It was really impressive and useful for those who are observing the changing scenario of caste politics in India'. Similarly, Prasanna, editor at Centre-Right India wrote: 'I recently read your outstanding essay in Seminar Magazine titled &quot;Caste and Politics in Tamil Nadu&quot;. It was really perspicacious and offered a lot of insights ... I am hoping if you could write a column/essay covering the Tamil Nadu politics that you have explored as part of your research'. In November 2014, CNN-IBN requested an interview having read the Hindu article on the caste census, saying: 'it was such a great analytical piece on complex Indian society'. I have also co-authored three short pieces aimed at prompting debate and disseminating research findings in Economic and Political Weekly (EPW). EPW combines current affairs commentary with social research and brings 'academics, researchers, policy makers, independent thinkers, members of non-governmental organisations and political activists' into debate with each other over critical issues. The dissemination strategy for the project deliberately targeted such pieces as a means of reaching out to the activists and party members who are the core focus of the research. Blog pieces in activist focused sites like RoundTableIndia - a Dalit focused site that 'aims to focus on the twin objectives of generating information and interaction necessary to aid, in howsoever small way, the progress of the Dalits' - have enabled the research to reach a much wider audience. Finally, I have taken the research to a wider audience in the UK, by means of an appearance on Thinking Allowed (BBC Radio 4) to discuss my key findings with Laurie Taylor, and exchange in the letters page of the Financial Times about caste and capitalism.\nEducated members of the public were also reached through a series of public lectures in Madurai, Chennai, Mumbai and Delhi. Each of these lectures was advertised in the local media and attended by between 30 and 50 people in each case. The lectures drew on data gathered in the field, and the talk in Madurai was delivered in English and Tamil for the benefit of local audiences. Wider engagement has occurred through a series of presentations and conferences including a workshop in Edinburgh that brought activists and academics together. The workshop focused on caste and politics in Tamil Nadu and was attended by a group of nearly 20 experts. Alongside leading academics, the workshop included key figures from the Dalit land-rights struggle and from Dalit politics. A panel on caste for the British Association of South Asian Studies annual conference was attended by a British Dalit activist keen to discuss caste issues. A workshop on institutionalisation and marginal actors is currently being worked into an edited collection to be co-edited by Roger Jeffery, Suryakant Waghmore and me and it is expected to be of interest to user groups as well as academics.\nFinally, I have also sought to take the findings of the research directly to user groups in a number of ways. Firstly I participated in a number of Dalit movement meetings and contributed to them. In June 2012, for example, I addressed a meeting of the party I was studying to offer feedback on findings to leaders and the members at the event. This was a public and widely advertised meeting that drew an audience of over 300 people including the central leader of the party and the talk was delivered in Tamil. This meeting was followed up with a brief resume of findings and all papers and articles have been circulated to key figures within the party. Furthermore, an interview that I conducted with a party leader has been published online in full. This has been taken up in several places and reprinted in several blogs in India. Finally, one of the General Secretaries of the party was invited to a conference of activists and academics in Edinburgh. He was unable to attend at the last minute, but joined the workshop by Skype and interacted with the participants and exchanged ideas and discussed key issues with us. The proceedings were written up and published in Seminar magazine.

The transformation occurred largely to avoid socio-political repression and pressure more than from any real faith in politics. Opponents insisted that politics was a sewer that would corrupt and defile the movement (Gorringe 2005). Over a decade later, I returned to find out what party members and Dalits on the ground make of the party’s performance. In 2012 I revisited my earlier fieldsite and adopted a similar ethnographic approach. Research focused on Madurai district in south-central Tamil Nadu. I carried out 60 formal and 58 informal interviews and had countless conversations with party members, affiliates, and members of other Dalit organisations in villages, towns and cities in order to capture attitudes and changes since 1999. Several interviews were with activists I had interacted with in 1999, thus giving the research a longitudinal dimension. As in the earlier research, I also observed 24 key events held by the party or other Dalit outfits and captured the speeches as well as the atmosphere of the occasions. Finally, Roger Jeffery and I secured election data from CSDS enabling us to place the experiences of the VCK within a wider Indian context of Dalit politics.\n\nEchoing the wider literature on activist institutionalisation, I discovered widespread disillusionment with the party. The intensity, awareness and mobilisation which characterised the movement in 1999 have decreased. Factional conflicts and distrust are now out in the open, and there is a persistent accusation that local leaders prioritise their own well-being over that of the party and the people. Becoming a party has also forced the VCK to reach out to non-Dalits, meaning that some Dalit respondents felt abandoned or betrayed. The ethnographic approach highlighted a disparity between media and leader perspectives of the movement and those of Dalits on the ground. Despite this, most Dalit respondents felt an attachment to the party. \n\nInitial analysis has focused on the politicisations of caste politics (as seen in articles for Seminar, Economic and Political Weekly, The Hindu and Frontline); the attempt to move beyond the Dalit category (as in the paper for The South Asianist); processes that I have termed ‘informal institutionalisation’ that lead new parties to adopt particular ways of doing politics rather than just entering institutions (as seen in the papers in Still’s volume and for Hyderabad); the gendered nature of party politics (as seen in papers for Kapadia and Anandhi’s forthcoming volume and the FWSA); and the political preferences of Dalits (with Roger Jeffery for Marginalisation Conference). In recognition of the significance of my research I was invited to an EHRC expert seminar on Caste in the UK and have subsequently teamed up with colleagues in Manchester and Mumbai to put together proposal on transnational Dalit activism that will shortly be submitted to the ESRC. The research has already had some user engagement and public dissemination. Articles written for Seminar, Economic and Political Weekly and The Hindu have been widely circulated and discussed. In 2012, I addressed a meeting of the VCK in which I was able to feedback some of my findings both to leaders and the members at the event. An interview with the Propaganda Secretary of the Party has been published online and reprinted in several blogs. One of the General Secretaries of the party was invited to the workshop in December and joined the meeting by Skype. Key findings and issues have been shared with these leaders from the outset and have generated discussion. Beyond the VCK, evidence of the wider interest in the research may be seen in that following my papers for Seminar and The Hindu I was approached by a number of publications and asked to offer user-friendly analyses for their readers. Papers in Bheem Patrika – a Dalit journal in northern India, Manorama Yearbook - described as ‘the largest selling general knowledge update in the country’, and the well known Centre Right India blog, all resulted from invitations. K.C. Narayanan, editor of Manorama Yearbook, for example stated: ‘I write this note after reading your article in today's Hindu, on the caste violence in Tamil Nadu. It was really impressive and useful for those who are observing the changing scenario of caste politics in India. I was wondering whether you could help us by writing an article for the Yearbook too’. Further such articles and public dissemination are planned. Attempts to maximise the reach and relevance of the research have occurred in four main ways:\n\na. Disseminating and discussing findings at conferences and seminars: So far I have presented papers in Madurai, Chennai, Mumbai, Delhi, and Hyderabad in India; at the University of Pennsylvania in the US; and in Edinburgh and at the FWSA conference in Nottingham. Papers presented will be revised in light of the feedback received and worked into journal articles.\n\nb. Organising workshops and conference panels that bring researchers in this area together: To date, I have organised two events in Edinburgh. In September 2013 a workshop on the ‘institutionalisation of marginal actors’ brought together a range of academics from India and Europe and will feed into an edited collection; and a workshop on caste and politics in Tamil Nadu in December 2013 brought academics and activists from India and Europe together to discuss current developments – the key findings of this discussion have been written up and will be submitted to journals in India. In April 2014, I am co-convening a panel on Dalit lives at the BASAS annual conference.\n\nc. A project webpage detailing emerging findings has been set up and populated with conference papers and work in progress.\n\nd. Disseminating findings in popular journals and newspapers: Articles have already been written for Seminar, Economic and Political Weekly, Frontline, The Hindu and Manorama Yearbook, for instance, and further such articles will be written and submitted as the analysis proceeds.\n\nIn addition to the above I have submitted a book proposal to SAGE that will allow for a fuller and more detailed discussion of the research for a wider audience.
