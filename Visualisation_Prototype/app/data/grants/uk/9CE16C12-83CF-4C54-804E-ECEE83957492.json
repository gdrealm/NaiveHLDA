{"id":"9CE16C12-83CF-4C54-804E-ECEE83957492","title":"Consolidated Grant for Astrophysics and Space Science at the University of Kent","abstractText":"Our Sun and planet are part of the Solar System which contains many other objects including asteroids and man-made satellites. These are all subject to remarkable dynamical phenomena brought about by extraordinary speeds. This System is just one of billions in our Galaxy, of which the origins and development stretch our imaginations and technology to the limit, involving quite unexplored dynamical and physical concepts. The Centre for Astrophysics and Planetary Science (CAPS) requests long-term funding to support a successful programme of research into the origins of the Solar System, forming stars and stellar systems. The physical regimes associated with molecular clouds, protoplanetary discs as well as the present Solar System are foreign to our experience but the norm in the interstellar medium of our Galaxy. The aim of the Centre is to explore the new observational phenomena, novel physical concepts and to test innovative ideas.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/K000888/1","grantId":"ST/K000888/1","fundValue":"406113","fundStart":"2013-04-01","fundEnd":"2016-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Michael  Smith","coPersons":["Mark Joseph Burchell","Mark Colin Price"],"organisation":"University of Kent","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
