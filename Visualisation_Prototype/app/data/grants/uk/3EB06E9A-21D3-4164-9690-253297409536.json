In addition to research projects PATHWAYS runs training courses.</p>\n\n<p>The substantive and methodological strands aim to enhance the ability of the social science community to investigate specific hypotheses and therefore design public health interventions, and also to promote methodological exchange between the social and biomedical research communities.
