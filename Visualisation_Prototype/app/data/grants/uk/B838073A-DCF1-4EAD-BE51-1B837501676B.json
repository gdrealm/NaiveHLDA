Hence the likely effects on labour market outcomes of changes in policy concerning access to education will be established. </p>\n\n<p>The project will use data from the Indian NSSO and REDS surveys and the Brazilian PNAD survey. Where possible the analysis will be by way of a fully dynamic structural discrete choice modelling framework - this models workers' choices in each period by reference to the implications of these choices for each point in the workers' entire career path. Policy effects will be evaluated within that framework. The modelling strategy requires the use of panel (or pseudo-panel) data. As a check on the results of this analysis, static discrete choice models will also be estimated. <br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-238-25-0014","grantId":"RES-238-25-0014","fundValue":"89284","fundStart":"2010-04-01","fundEnd":"2011-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Geraint  Johnes","coPersons":["Aradhna  Aggarwal","Ricardo  Freguglia","Gisele  Spricigo"],"organisation":"Lancaster University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
