{"id":"DEA14156-58CE-4C20-AE88-44BA75196B33","title":"Fictionalism and expressive power","abstractText":"Sometimes we utter sentences which we utter are untrue but manage to communicate a truth. Many metaphorical utterances have this character. To use an example of Kendall Walton's, it can be useful to describe a cloud as angry. This ascription of anger is untrue, since clouds never have emotional states. But uttering it can convey something true about how the cloud looks. Moreover, this truth would be very difficult to articulate in a literal fashion.\\n Some philosophers of mathematics have recently suggested that mathematical utterances are useful untruths. They are untrue since the entities they refer to, such as numbers, do not exist; but they are useful because they enable us to communicate truths about entities such as animals and micro-physical particles, which do exist.\\n The first part of my project is to work out what the best version of this theory is. I will then draw on this in applying the idea of communicatively useful untruth to two areas of our talk where this idea has been little explored: talk of truth and talk of dependence. Ascriptions of truth seem to help us make claims we could not otherwise make: for instance, I can say that everything a certain historian says is true, whereas it would be much more time-consuming to repeat every single one of the historian's claims. I will argue that ascriptions of truth are useful untruths; and I will explain how this view is superior to accounts of truth-talk already in the literature. In the final part of the project, I will argue that the notion of a useful untruth sheds light on our talk of one thing depending on another: talk that is central to metaphysics but currently only dimly understood.\\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/H005463/1","grantId":"AH/H005463/1","fundValue":"24316","fundStart":"2010-02-01","fundEnd":"2010-05-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"David Edward Liggins","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
