However, many of the widely used antibiotics are becoming less effective due to the multidrug resistance phenomena developed in bacteria. One of the major methods utilised in bacterial multidrug resistance is the active extrusion of numerous toxic compounds by proteins embedded in the bacterial cell membranes known as multidrug-efflux transporters or efflux pumps. Proteins carry out the majority of the work inside a cell and have well defined 3-dimensional structures. Protein structures determine how they work. The structural information on proteins involved in antibiotical resistance would therefore potentially help us design better antibiotics to combat the bacterial antibiotic resistance. Proteins are extremely small and we need to use a special technique called X-ray crystallography to determine their structures. X-ray crystallography is a challenging technique requiring the production of large amount of proteins and protein crystals. Membrane proteins are often difficult to produce and therefore impose significant challenge to study using X-ray crystallography. Transcription regulators control genes to be expressed and proteins to be produced and they are not often easier to produce in large quantity. Fortunately, some of the transcription regulators for the efflux pumps respond to the same range of toxic compounds as the transporters therefore studying the regulators offer alternative avenue to understand multidrug recognition and resistance.\n\nThe proposed study here tries to obtain the structures of the gene regulators that control the efflux pumps expression in the bacterium P. putida. P. putida has the unusual ability of tolerating high concentrations of toxic compounds and is a close relative of P. flourescens and P. aeruginosa, the later commonly found in humans and animals. Three sets of efflux pumps have been identified and four gene regulators were shown to control their gene expressions. Two of the regulators, called TtgR and TtgV, are shown to play important roles on the cell s ability to survive in toxic environment. We plan to study TtgR and TtgV structurally in order to understand how a single protein could recognise a wide range of different molecules and how the binding of the molecules allows the gene expression of the efflux pumps. This structural information obtained here should help us understand how P. putida and other pathogenic bacteria achieve multidrug resistance and could be exploited for developing potential antimicrobials and novel drugs.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0501723","grantId":"G0501723","fundValue":"370558","fundStart":"2006-06-28","fundEnd":"2009-06-27","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Xiaodong  Zhang","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
