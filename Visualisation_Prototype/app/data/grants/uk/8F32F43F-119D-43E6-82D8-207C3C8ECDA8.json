Huge advances in measuring such interactions have occurred in recent years with the development of a technique called surface-plasmon resonance (SPR). For the past 6 years we have successfully employed a Biacore X instrument, which is a basic SPR apparatus, to make measurements in a variety of systems. However, we have become acutely aware of the limitations of the X. Last year Biacore launched its latest development in SPR technology, the Biacore T100, which contains impressive technological advances over the X, enabling measurements of greatly increased sensitivity and sophistication. We describe research programmes in plant and microbial sciences that will benefit enormously from the acquisition of a Biacore T100 instrument.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E013074/1","grantId":"BB/E013074/1","fundValue":"201197","fundStart":"2007-09-05","fundEnd":"2008-09-04","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Anthony  Maxwell","coPersons":["Stephen  Bornemann","Giles  Oldroyd","Raymond Alan  Dixon"],"organisation":"John Innes Centre","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
