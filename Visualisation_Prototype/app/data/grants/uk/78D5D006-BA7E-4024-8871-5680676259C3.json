A person might have led a blameless life for sixty years; their current personality may be entirely without malice; they may have little memory of the crimes they committed. Yet we hold them morally and legally responsible for those past events. One natural rationalization for this practice is that the person today is the very same individual who committed those crimes: this fact creates at least a prima facie case for holding them responsible for the earlier actions.\\n\\nPhilosophers, lawyers and the general public debate the merits of cases such as these. Philosophers in particular have struggled with the question at the heart of the matter: what it is for one person to survive to a later point in time? Some have thought that, for the war criminal in 1940 to be the very same person as the old man in 2006, there must at least be significant psychological connections---perhaps memories, perhaps shared goals and projects---between the two. If that is right, it will be a substantial question---and one on which key legal and moral claims should turn---whether the old man really stands in the right kind of psychological relations to (what we would usually call) his 'earlier self'. On such a view, absent these relations we no longer have someone morally or criminally resonsible for the crimes (and insofar as current moral and legal practice fails to fit with this, it stands in need of revision). A leading defender of such psychological constraints on personal survival is Derek Parfit; and his discussion of these issues in the seminal 'Reasons and Persons' is the starting point for this project.\\n\\nThis project focuses on metaphysical questions about survival: and in particular, on the nature and consequences of a Parfittian claim I call the 'principle of intrinsic survival'. This is, at basis, the idea that survival in the sense in which it is relevant to issues of moral or criminal responsibility can't be something that depends on what goes on 'external to' the person themselves. To determine whether or not the old man is the surviving war criminal, and so can be held responsible for war crimes, we should look only to the bodily and psychological relations the old man bears to the young man who committed those crimes. This principle rules out theories which would make facts about survival depend on facts about the surrounding environment, the activities and opinions of others, and so forth. It is a substantive and disputable principle, but one that Parfit holds to be at the core of anything worth calling personal survival. \\n\\nThe core of the project is to provide an exact formulation of the principle of intrinisic survival, which despite its influence and intuitive appeal has not received the focused attention it deserves. This provides the basis for evaluating the consequences of the principle, which turn out to be sensitive to its exact formulation (to begin with, one question might concern the scope of the principle: should it just govern the survival of persons, or does it equally constrain the persistence through time of other natural objects and artefacts?) I bring this sharpened tool to bear on fundamental questions in the philosophy of persistence, vagueness, and personal identity. In particular, I argue that among its consequences are claims about the nature of persons so extreme that many will prefer to reject the priniciple itself, rather than accept its implications. In this way this project makes available an evaluation of the principle of intrinsic survival itself, as well as tracing its implications for other philosophical debates.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/E004288/1","grantId":"AH/E004288/1","fundValue":"23003","fundStart":"2008-02-01","fundEnd":"2008-05-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"John Robert Williams","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":" Some creatures---amoeba, for example---undergo fission. First you have one amoeba, a process occurs, and you're left with two. Is the amoeba you started with still around afterwards, or does it go out of existence in the process? \n\nWith the best will in the world, we're not going to worry too much about the survival-over-time of amoeba. But what if humans could undergo something like this fission? Science fiction is full of technology that could produce these results---from machines that could duplicate bodies, to mad scientists splitting brains in two and implanting them into new host bodies. As with the best sci-fi thought experiments, engaging with them confronts us with deep questions about ourselves. In this case, what is highlighted is the nature of our persistence through time, and asking whether there's anything to survival over and above the psychological and physiological relations you undoubtedly share with the products of such a &amp;quot;fission&amp;quot;. Is there, beyond these, a further meaningful question about which would be *you*? \n\nThe research in this grant focused on pinning down the philosophical assumptions that turn these fission scenarios into paradoxes---cases where our common sense verdicts conflict with one another. \n\nThe main outcome paper (&amp;quot;Part-intrinsicality&amp;quot;) pinned down an elusive idea---that our survival through time should be an &amp;quot;internal&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;intrinsic&amp;quot; matter. If you can survive a process on Monday, for example, you should be able to survive an exact duplicate process on Tuesday. Whether something is going differently in the surrounding environment on Tuesday (crucially, whether or not a rival 'fission product' is being created in the next room) cannot make a difference to survival. That assumption drives the puzzle, but it takes careful formulation---the most natural articulations of it cannot be correct. So the paper formulates a new weaker version that is immune to the examples but still generates the puzzle. \n\nThe principle means that in fission scenarios, one survives twice over---you are *both* the fission products. Further, and perhaps more radically, it shows that the same principle can be used to argue that in real-world cases, we are not single individuals but massively overlapping clusters. This illustrates the way that principles made salient through sci-fi thought experiments can teach us something about our actual situation. \n\nThe other strand of the research was to pursue an alternative to the &amp;quot;multiple survival&amp;quot; response to fission---the proposal one survives fission, but that there is no fact of the matter which fission product is you. Examination of these ideas generated much productive work on the cognitive role of indeterminacy, some of which is represented in the outcomes---in particular work on indeterminacy and parthood, and indeterminacy and conditionals. The issue about how indeterminacy impact on cognition was an extremely productive line of research that has structured much of my work for the last six years, and my most recent work has brought this full circle by applying the lessons of that work back to the case of fission. The part-intrinsicality principle has interest for metaphysicians of persistence through time and the nature of ordinary objects. The work on indeterminacy initiated by this project has broad ramifications. Healthcare","dataset":"gtr"}
