Although Indian women are one of the most disadvantaged groups in neoliberal multicultural development, policy pays them little attention. Indigenous women's position in development decision-making is marked by gender and racial marginality, lack of voice and incomplete citizenship rights. Yet little is known about Ecuadorian indian women's responses to recent development changes, nor whether inclusion policies on ethnic and gender inclusion are successful. </p>\n\n<p>Sarah Radcliffe analyses how particular Indian women (Kichwa, Shuar and Ts&aacute;chila) are placed in relation to recent legislation and policy shifts, how they experience them, and how they engage in unfolding processes of change. Ecuadorian indigenous women have been essentialised and made invisible in policy, social movement ideology and national social discourses. </p>\n\n<p>The project offers a systematic analysis of ethnically diverse and spatially differentiated women's experiences at a series of decision-making levels. The research responds to an urgent need to address indigenous women's concerns and situation, while contributing to wider academic, policy and citizenship agendas. The research agenda represents an original approach to issues of gender and ethnicity in geography, development studies and Latin American studies. </p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E019714/1","grantId":"ES/E019714/1","fundValue":"128482","fundStart":"2008-09-26","fundEnd":"2012-05-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  They have been used extensively in publications - major monograph, journal articles, and in many conference papers and plenary lectures. \n\nThe research also informed a consultancy undertaken with Oxfam America and GIZ on indigenous women, Afro-Ecuadorian women and development agendas, which occurred in 2012-14, and was published in Quito in 2014 and taken to the World Conference of Indigenous Peoples in New York, September 2014 Government, Democracy and Justice,Other Societal","person":"Sarah Anne Radcliffe","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":" The research found that current development policy for poverty alleviation approaches social diversity in reduced and narrow ways, largely through the lens of gender, or race-ethnicity, or rural areas, or vulnerability. By working with indigenous women in two ethnic populations in Ecuador, the research found that although indigenous women might be rural, women, indigenous and poor, that they were often excluded from development programmes. Using women's experiences and insights into this exclusion, the research identified persistent frameworks about the relative utility of different kinds of people - and their diversity - that forged and justified patterns of exclusion. The research also documented how indigenous women draw upon their experience of intersectional exclusion to draw up new agendas and creative practices through which to change development thinking. The research should inform development thinking and policy making to take social differences more seriously, and to think critically and self-reflexively on the limited attention so far given to the dilemmas of difference within development. \nThe findings are also proving useful to indigenous women and other subaltern women's groups in providing a framework through which to extend their critiques and efforts to reformulate development and public policy.
