Currently there are temperature and time restrictions on the exposure of electronics systems within the down-well logging application. This proposal aims to extend the high temperature electronics packaging capability to up to 250 oC for a lifetime of up to 10 years. This will be achieved through novel substrate and interconnection technologies that will optimise thermal management, mechanical robustness and are suited to high temperature environments. Advanced modelling/accelerated life tests and failure analysis will be used to yield accurate life predictions within the down-well logging environment. Spin-off benefits will also apply to the aerospace industry.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=DT/E010873/1","grantId":"DT/E010873/1","fundValue":"110340","fundStart":"2007-09-30","fundEnd":"2011-06-29","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Colin  Johnston","coPersons":["Patrick  Grant"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
