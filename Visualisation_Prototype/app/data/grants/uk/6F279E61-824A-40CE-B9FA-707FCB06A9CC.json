As soon as Darwin and Wallace presented their theory of evolution by natural selection, around 150 years ago, the numerous ways of avoiding predation provided crucial examples for illustrating and defending natural selection and adaptation. Animal coloration has also influenced many areas of human applications and culture. For example, camouflage is of great importance in military applications and has influenced peaceful areas of culture such as art and fashion. Camouflage is one of the most important anti-predator adaptations in nature and crucial to the survival of individuals in countless species. It is a textbook example of natural selection.\nGiven the importance of camouflage, it is unsurprising that many different types exist. These include background matching, where the animal matches the general appearance of its environment, and disruptive coloration, where the outline of the animal's body is broken up by strongly contrasting markings. In addition, some animals may use masquerade, where they resemble an apparently unimportant object in the environment such as a leaf or stone. Within the last decade substantial research has investigated the different types of camouflage that may exist and how they may work in terms of predator vision. Studies of camouflage have been undertaken by evolutionary, sensory, molecular, and behavioural biologists, experimental psychologists, artists and computer scientists. Camouflage research is consequently a vibrant and interdisciplinary area and a model system for investigating animal behaviour, vision, and evolutionary biology. However, numerous gaps in our knowledge remain. Remarkably, given how important camouflage is, we still know little about it in real animals. While recent theoretical breakthroughs have been numerous, work has almost entirely been undertaken in artificial systems. Consequently, we know little of how such findings relate to the natural world. In short, camouflage theory from artificial systems greatly outstrips our understanding in real species and habitats. However, we can now use this theory to make a range of predictions about camouflage and its evolution in the wild. \nIn this project, we use camouflage in birds eggs as a model system to test several key questions about concealment, its value and evolution. Avian egg camouflage makes a wonderful system because the backgrounds on which many species nest is well known, substantial information about breeding biology exists, predators are often well documented, and bird eggs in many species have impressive camouflage. We will conduct research in South Africa and Zambia over two field seasons, using several groups of birds (mainly plovers and nightjars). We will locate nests of various species and undertake analyses of the colour and pattern of the eggs against the background on which they were laid. Using mathematical models of animal vision and techniques from computer science, we will analyse how camouflaged the different egg types are against the different available backgrounds, and determine the camouflage type that is present. In addition, we will check nests at regular intervals over the incubation period and determine which nests are eaten by predators and how long the different eggs survived. We will record predation events to determine the main predator groups for each species so that we can model egg appearance in terms of predator vision. Using these data, we will answer several key questions: 1) how does the level and type of camouflage affect the survival of an individual's eggs, 2) does the background structure influence the type of camouflage that evolves, and 3) how do species that nest on multiple background types optimise their level of concealment over evolution? Our study will reveal fundamental answers about how the type and level of camouflage influences survival in complex natural environments.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/J018309/1","grantId":"BB/J018309/1","fundValue":"418613","fundStart":"2012-08-01","fundEnd":"2013-01-14","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Research publications and outreach Education Societal","person":"Martin  Stevens","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":" The project is still ongoing but preliminary results have shown that several species of ground nesting bird select local microhabitats that better match the colour and pattern of their eggs compared to habitat patches further away. \n\n\n\nSurvival data have shown that high contrast eggs fare well on high contrast backgrounds, and low contrast eggs on low contrast backgrounds. However, adults that lay high contrast eggs on low contrast backgrounds are less likely to survive, and the predation risk is always high for eggs on a low contrast background.\n\n\n\nComparisons have shown that the egg colours and patterns of some species are matched to their backgrounds better than those of other species, and other nests from the same species.\n\n\n\nOur citizen science egg and adult nightjar games have highlighted trade-offs between di- and trichromatic predator visual systems, with dichromats outperforming trichromats under certain circumstances where prey contrast and background contrast is high.
