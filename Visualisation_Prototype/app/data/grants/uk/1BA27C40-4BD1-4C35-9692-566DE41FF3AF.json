How best to advise patients to increase their physical activity in a cost effective way is unknown. We propose to assess how feasible it is for GPs to deliver a simple, low cost intervention to increase daily walking in inactive patients. We also intend to assess the feasibility of adding a pedometer (a small device for recording walking) to the brief GP advice.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0802118","grantId":"G0802118","fundValue":"345248","fundStart":"2010-06-01","fundEnd":"2011-11-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Melvyn  Hillsdon","coPersons":["Katrina  Turner","Tim  Holt","Rod  Taylor","Deborah  Sharp","Marie  Murphy","Margaret  Thorogood"],"organisation":"University of Exeter","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
