{"id":"A068AC3D-DDE8-4E24-B4D3-16290FD7909A","title":"Anomalous Deterministic Transport and Fluctuation Relations","abstractText":"Imagine a glass of water. Now imagine a droplet of ink carefully put into the water. If one waits long enough, the whole water glass will eventually be coloured uniformly blue. This is due to what is called a diffusion process of the ink molecules. Such a macroscopically observable process must originate from microscopic collisions between ink and water molecules. The research discipline of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics describes such processes in terms of physical theories. However, more recently scientists have learned that microscopic scattering processes between atoms and molecules are typically highly nonlinear, or ``chaotic'', like collisions between billiard balls. This asks for establishing crosslinks between the statistical physical theory of transport processes and the mathematical theory of nonlinear dynamical systems.With my research I wish to contribute to two central topics in this very active field of research, which emerged over the past few years: My first topic is the theoretical understanding of anomalous transport processes, where specific types of correlated microscopic collision processes lead to unexpected behavior on macroscopic scales like localization of particles, or counter-intuitive long ballistic flights. Particularly, I wish to derive fundamental equations relating measurable transport coefficients to dynamical systems quantities that characterize the degree of nonlinearity in the particle's equations of motion. My second topic is the theoretical analysis of fluctuations in many-particle systems under application of constraints such as external fields. As was recently discovered, such fluctuations can be described in terms of specific mathematical symmetry relations, which generalize the second law of thermodynamics. These relations are thought to be particularly important for assessing the stability of objects on nanoscales such as polymers or small biological entities. This part of my project aims at verifying such relations both for abstract mathematical models and for migrating biological cells that have already been studied in experiments. Eventually, such research may lead to new methods for distinguishing deficient cells from healthy ones on the basis of their fluctuation properties.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E00492X/1","grantId":"EP/E00492X/1","fundValue":"206859","fundStart":"2007-01-01","fundEnd":"2008-12-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Reported in various publications, on conferences and in seminars.
