We used screens against other bacteria, insects, nematodes and both insect and mammalian cells to isolate regions of the Photorhabdus genome involved in both symbiosis and pathogenesis. The screen against macrophages can be used in screens for vaccine candidates. We have filed a US patent on the use of this technology to screen bacterial genomes for vaccine candidates.
