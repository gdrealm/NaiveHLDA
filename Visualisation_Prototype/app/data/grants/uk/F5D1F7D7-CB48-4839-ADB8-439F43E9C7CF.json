Examples of impacts of climate change in urban areas include excessive heat, water scarcity and flooding. Whilst it is impossible to attribute individual extreme events to climate change, recent events including the 2003 heat wave that struck Paris and other European cities, and hurricane Katrina in New Orleans have illustrated the potential for large scale weather-related disruption of urban function, from which it may take months or years to recover. In recognition of the significance of climate change in urban areas, from the points of view of both adaptation and mitigation, in 2005 the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research launched a new research programme on Engineering Urban Systems . Building on the previous success of the Tyndall Centre in interdisciplinary integrated assessment, the Tyndall Centre Cities Programme brought together research expertise from seven universities (four of which are represented in the ARCADIA project) and a high profile stakeholder group to develop an Urban Integrated Assessment Facility (UIAF) that simulates long term changes in urban areas and can be used as a platform for testing the effectiveness of adaptation and mitigation strategies. The ARCADIA project will launch an ambitious new phase of development of the Tyndall Centre UIAF in order to understand better the vulnerability and resilience of urban areas. The ARCADIA project is highly interdisciplinary and involves input from an influential group of stakeholders from business and local and central government, with interests in planning, infrastructure, the built environment and climate change adaptation and mitigation. This group will work with the research team to ensure that the project is orientated towards user needs. Indeed the first research task will involve close work with stakeholders to understand how the advance modelling tools being developed in the Tyndall Centre can best inform decision making. Task 2 will identify the various direct and indirect modes in which climate impacts disrupt urban function and will go on to examine potential adaptation mechanisms and barriers to adaptation. In Task 3 the Tyndall Centre will team up with the Climatic Research Unit at UEA and the Met Office Hadley Centre to develop new probabilistic scenarios for urban areas that are consistent with UKCIP08. Task 4 will model the relationship between climate impacts and the urban economy, in order to identify how the economy may be disrupted by climate change. By analysing change in the economy through time and interactions between economic sectors, we will understand better how the urban economy can be made more resilient. Task 5 will combine the economic model developed in Task 4 with a new model of the spatial planning of buildings and infrastructure in urban areas. As well as identifying concentrations of vulnerability, this will enable the simulation of potential redesign of the built environment under different scenarios of climate and other drivers such as employment and changes to the transport system.The final research task will, working with stakeholders, use the new understanding of the vulnerability of urban systems to analyse how adaptation of urban areas can enhance resilience over a range of timescales. The objective will be to make practical proposals for 'adaptation pathways' for cities over the 21st Century to respond strategically to the challenges of flooding, water scarcity and extremes of heat.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G061211/1","grantId":"EP/G061211/1","fundValue":"129023","fundStart":"2009-09-03","fundEnd":"2012-09-02","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Collaborations and uptake of ARCADIA methods and tools\nInteraction between UK academia and industry/government was fundamental in the design, implementation, and dissemination of the ARCADIA project. These interactions have been based upon the expertise of the ARCADIA team (spanning many disciplines), and began with introducing the research programme. From the outset key stakeholders were identified and invited to collaborate in setting the research agenda and provide feedback on the project tasks. Bi-annual stakeholder meetings were held to allow consultation on the modelling methods and strategy. This allowed areas of specific interest and policy relevance to be identified; new data, research projects and programmes to be introduced and shared, and partnerships extended throughout the course of the project.\nThroughout the ARCADIA project intermediary results were presented and discussed, and model tools developed and demonstrated. These interactions continued all the way through the project, culminating in a final stakeholder event. This was well attended with participants from the public and private sector, including the GLA, DCLG, TfL, Anglian Water, TSB and various academic institutions.\nOverall the ARCADIA projects whole-system approach allowed the exploration of a wide range of scenarios and their implications at a city level. The research framework and tools developed has been novel in their consistent use of spatial and temporal probabilistic outputs, including the incorporation of the urban heat island effect. As such, ARCADIA has shaped thinking and facilitated analysis and decision making around future climate risks and adaptation strategies. The following collaborations show evidence of the uptake of ARCADIA research, methods and tools:\n\nLondon Climate Change Adaptation Strategy: Work from ARCADIA was cited in the London Climate Change Adaptation Strategy (2011. p.72), on overheating risk. The report picked up on ARCADIA research which used additional climate and land surface models to evaluate the potential influence of the urban land surface on UKCP09 probabilistic climate projections, and implications for future heatwaves. The report was produced by colleagues the Met Office Hadley Centre.\nClimate UK, Summary of Climate Change Risks for London: Work from ARCADIA was cited in the Summary of Climate Change Risks for London (2012, p.8). The report was written to coincide with the publication of the UK Climate Change Risk Assessment (CCRA) 2012. The report picked up on ARCADIA research which used additional climate and land surface models to evaluate the potential influence of the urban land surface on UKCP09 probabilistic climate projections, and implications for future heatwaves.\nAdaptation Sub-Committee of the Committee on Climate Change (CCC): Work from ARCADIA was cited in the Adaptation Sub-Committee Progress Report 2014: Managing climate risks to well-being and the economy (p.144 &amp;amp; p.147). ARCADIA work on heat related mortality risk was cited and research provided evidence to support a standard or requirement for measures to combat overheating in new homes.\nLondon Underground, Cooling the Tube Programme: Collaboration on impacts of heat for thermal discomfort on the London Underground. In this study LU provided platform temperature sensor data which could be used to infer external to internal temperatures, as well as outputs from a passenger thermal comfort model. The ARCADIA team used outputs from the spatial urban Weather Generator to provide a risk based analysis of the future number of days when passengers travelling on sections of the Tube could be subjected to thermal discomfort under future scenarios of climate change, and the potential number of passengers dissatisfied.\nGreater London Authority, Drain London Project: Collaboration on the implication of climate change for future surface water flood risk and impacts, and options for adaptation. The GLA provided Drain London surface water flood risk maps. The ARCADIA team have used these maps to assess future flood risk, economic impacts, and options for adaptation, based on outputs from the spatial urban Weather Generator.\nEnvironment Agency, Water Resources Management Plans: The ARCADIA project provided evidence to the WRMP report, which in turn provided recommendations to the EA. This included evidence on risk-based water resources planning in England and Wales under a changing climate.

The starting point for development of the UWG was the first version of the single-site Weather Generator (WG) developed at the Universities of Newcastle and East Anglia (UEA) for the national climate projections UKCP09. A number of major gaps in the UKCP09 WG were identified and have been addressed in ARCADIA. As a result of UEA work, the reproduction of extreme temperatures (both daily maximum and hourly extremes) and the persistence of heat waves has been improved (previously these were all under-estimated). UEA has also contributed to development of a spatial capability. Applications to major cities and regions require spatial fields of weather variables capturing persistent spatial patterns such as Urban Heat Islands (UHIs) as well as other forms of correlation affecting collective risk such as spatial dependence of extreme rainfall or extreme temperature.\n\nThe ARCADIA UWG provides daily time series of temperature, rainfall and other weather variables for 5 km grid squares across London and southeast England. It is based on and consistent with UKCP09 but additional provides both spatially-consistent information and a representation of the UHI. The consistency with UKCP09 is due to use of the same ‘climate change factors’ which are applied to the statistical parameters of the weather generator, i.e., to ‘perturb’ the weather generator for future climate change. Thus the user can specify the desired emission scenario (High, Medium or Low) and time period (2020s, 2030s…..2090s).\n\nThe unique and new component of the ARCADIA weather generator is the capability to incorporate a representation of the UHI and changes in urban cover and/or heat release. These ‘urban change factors’ are derived from regional climate model (RCM) simulations undertaken by the Met Office Hadley Centre (MOHC) for ARCADIA. UEA has worked with the MOHC on the design and validation/evaluation of these simulations and on the methodology for incorporating the derived urban change factors into the UWG. \n\nThe resulting UWG allows users to explore the impacts of different future climate and urban development scenarios, including the potential impacts of adaptation and mitigation strategies (i.e., reduced urban coverage and/or heat release) as well as increasing urbanisation. The UWG is run through a User Interface developed by the University of Newcastle, with UEA and the MOHC contributing computer code and data as well as input on the overall design and specification. UEA also took the lead on writing guidance documentation for the UWG.\n\nThe UWG is one of a set of inter-linked decision-making tools developed by ARCADIA for London. In particular, it provides input for the ARCADIA heat risk assessment tool. The focus of this tool is the application of temperature thresholds to explore impacts such as thermal discomfort, mortality, labour productivity, and railway/tube disruption. UEA has assisted in the identification of appropriate thresholds, also considering the ability of the UWG to simulate such events. The ARCADIA Urban Weather Generator is one of a set of inter-linked decision-making tools developed by ARCADIA for London. In particular, it provides input for the ARCADIA heat risk assessment tool. The development of both tools has benefitted from input and guidance from the project stakeholders including the Greater London Authority and Transport for London. The User Interface developed for the ARCADIA Urban Weather Generator allows users to explore the impacts of different climate and urban development scenarios on local weather including temperature and other extremes. Whilst initially developed for London and the south-east, it has since been extended to cities and regions across the UK and has the potential to be extended beyond the UK. The generic nature of the approach is stressed in a journal paper which it is anticipated will be submitted in autumn 2013. Environment","dataset":"gtr"}
