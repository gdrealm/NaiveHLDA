{"id":"F3049C58-4DE5-42AE-B618-DABDFA87F2CF","title":"The political and moral economy of cord blood stem cell banking","abstractText":"<p>In recent years, the collection and storage of biological resources and data has commanded considerable sociological attention with respect to potentially new forms of regulatory, ethical and political economy. Much of this has focussed on quasi-public sector initiatives (Iceland's Decode database, UKBiobank, etc). </p>\n\n<p>Considerably less well researched are emerging commercial and private banks including blood stem cell banks offering parents the opportunity to pay to deposit cord blood stem cells taken at birth. Such banks have been instrumental in widely publicising the potential future use of stem cells in regenerative medicine and tissue engineering. In so doing, commercial cord blood banks can be seen to broker new corporeal-commodity relations and markets that directly connect parents with emerging biomedical industries. </p>\n\n<p>The purpose of this research is to explore the 'political and moral economy' of cord blood banking through new forms of consumption, parental responsibility and the changing balances between public and commercial bioscience.
