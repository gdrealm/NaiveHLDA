Data collected by the Home Office Citizenship Surveys are only available at national and regional levels and there is less evidence on levels of activity locally. Current interest in local participation and the appearance of volunteering targets in Local Area Agreements and Local Public Service Agreements increases the need for reliable local baseline data which is efficiently gathered.</p> \n<p>Building on primary longitudinal survey data from a previous study measuring social capital in South Yorkshire Coalfield communities, this study explores a number of methodological concerns related to the extent of participation in the communities. The aim is to devise a set of survey questions better matched to respondents' understanding of participation which elicit an accurate assessment of participation, and are designed to be efficient for effective use in other local surveys.</p> \n<p>The research approach will involve: </p> \n<ul> \n <li>Factor analysis to explore relationships between responses to survey questions about participation in local groups</li> \n <li>In-depth interviews to better understand activities residents are engaged in and to validate existing survey responses</li> \n <li>Findings will inform methodological review of existing survey methods and may help to suggest a more appropriate set of questions.</li>\n</ul>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2287","grantId":"RES-000-22-2287","fundValue":"42371","fundStart":"2007-07-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Janet Margaret Gilbertson","coPersons":["Julie Dawn Manning"],"organisation":"Sheffield Hallam University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
