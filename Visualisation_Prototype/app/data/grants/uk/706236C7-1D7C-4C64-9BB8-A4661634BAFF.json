The first is&nbsp;climate change, leading to extremes of and greater instabilities of weather, or economic activities which fit current climatic conditions becoming no longer viable. The second threat is the end of the era of cheap and plentiful oil, with the knock on that will have for carbon-fuelled economies, cheap transport, less long-distance tourism, and the need to focus more on local production of that which can be produced locally.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The seminar series therefore looks to identify the major threats to prosperity and social justice for local economies in the UK from climate change and resource depletion; what threats will require hard choices to be made and which might provide new opportunities; and what contribution can local authorities, NGOs, citizens and academics meaningfully make, and which require more structural change.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-451-25-4261","grantId":"RES-451-25-4261","fundValue":"13466","fundStart":"2006-10-31","fundEnd":"2009-04-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  This seminar series spun out a range of other projects by the PI and other researchers who took part in them, in particular the Low Carbon Liverpool project and the ESRC Research Seminars Competition: &quot;Sustainability transitions: rethinking everyday practices, identities and livelihoods&quot;, PI Dr Gavin Brown, University of Leicester.
