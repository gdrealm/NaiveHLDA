This is problematic both because those values are generally not reflected in readily available market prices and, more fundamentally, because of a general failure to bring together the natural, economic and social science necessary to develop the methods and research capacity required to address those valuation knowledge gaps. The current proposal represents an important step in addressing this underlying research capacity and integrated methodology problem. It is the product of an internationally renowned team of natural, economic and social scientists who have an established track record of high quality research both as individuals and collaboratively (the latter most notably as the key players within the UK National Ecosystem Assessment; NEA). Furthermore, even within the short research call period they have assembled the explicit, written backing of a very extensive network of further researchers from multiple fields drawn from across the UK and internationally. The Investigators propose the following programme to address the central research themes through a series of highly integrated workstreams (WS): Theme 1: Broadening the ecosystem service concept. - WS 1: Bridging research disciplines and engaging stakeholders Theme 2: Developing integrated valuation methods - WS 2.1 Valuing Ecosystem Service Flows: Addressing Natural Resource Complexity and Indirect Impacts - WS 2.2: Valuing the Sustainability of Stocks of Ecosystem Assets - WS 2.3: Integrating quantitative and qualitative valuation methods Theme 3: Improving understanding of ecosystem processes underpinning services. - WS 3.1: Metrics of changes in ecosystem processes, natural resource stocks and ecosystem services in the face of uncertainty. - WS 3.2: Understanding how changes in biodiversity influence ecosystem service delivery. - WS 3.3: Improved accessibility to, and integration of, existing biophysical and socio-economic information/ data sets. - WS 3.4: Developing integrated biophysical and socio-economic modelling of natural resources and ecosystem services, at relevant spatial and temporal scales, addressing risk and uncertainty. While we believe the proposed programme addresses the key issues, in line with the requirements of the call for proposals, this will be refined collaboratively within the first two months of the network's operation (and finalised resource allocations made accordingly) through a process of engagement with the wider research and policy communities. The final programme will be implemented through a series of pan-network open meetings and further intra-workstream meetings. In an effort to ensure that key issues are tackled and 'talking-shops' avoided, certain key activities (notably the development of a highly integrated valuation methodology) will be supported by empirical elements, designed to work in symbiosis with the allied network activities by tackling some of the most challenging areas of collaborative work. An annual meeting (in months 12 and 22) will bring together outputs from all themes and work streams and present these to an open national and international audience. Outputs will be further disseminated through: a dedicated website (also used as a first port of call for all interested parties); theme position papers and reports intended for various audiences including researchers and policymakers with the former aimed towards publication in peer reviewed journals; a pan-network synthesis report for which an offer of publication as a book has been received.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/I015086/1","grantId":"NE/I015086/1","fundValue":"628124","fundStart":"2011-02-01","fundEnd":"2014-04-30","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Ian Julian  Bateman","coPersons":["Dave  Raffaelli","Georgina Mary Mace","Andrew  Balmford","Roy  Haines-Young","Rosemary Susan Hails"],"organisation":"University of East Anglia","findingsText":" The Valuing Nature Network is both a network and a research programme. There are 10 research projects involving academics from social science, natural science and economics, plus policy, NGO and business people. The projects cover various aspects of valuing nature, such as the need for more clarity on issues of scale, sustainability, stocks and flows; across a range of social and environmental systems, such as marine governance, coastal decision-making, peatlands and use of agricultural land. Two of the projects have a specific business focus and one project looks directly at how valuation evidence is taken up and used in policy making. \n\n\n\nThe research projects were completed in December 2012 and outputs will be available on the website project pages between Jan and March 2013 http://www.valuing-nature.net/vnn-projects\n\n\n\nA synthesis of the project findings will be released at the Valuing Nature end of programme event on 19 March 2013 in London. Non-academics have been involved throughout, both through the network (this is free to join and is open to academics, business, policy and NGO members across the globe: http://www.valuing-nature.net/mailchimp/subscribe) and within the research projects. The projects were specifically designed to produce policy-relevant outcomes and tools. \n\n\n\nFor example: \n\n\n\n1. The Marine Governance project has produced an 'Interdisciplinary Marine Governance and Policy Tool', based on Bayesian Belief Networks, which will allow policy-makers to see all the components of the marine system (both environmental and social) and to test out the impact of proposed policy changes, to what impact this has for example on marine wildlife or on the people who rely on the sea for their income. \n\n\n\n2. The Wellbeing project aimed to understand the impact of conservation activities both on their biodiversity targets and on people living in the conservation area. \n\n\n The tools and models devised by the project teams can be used by policy-makers to test out the likely impact of their policy on the natural environment and on the people who rely on the environment for their income and livelihood.
