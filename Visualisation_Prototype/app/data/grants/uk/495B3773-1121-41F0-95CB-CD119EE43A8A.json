{"id":"495B3773-1121-41F0-95CB-CD119EE43A8A","title":"Monitoring and control of emissions in industrial processes using sensors","abstractText":"The aim of this project is to develop solid electrolyte based sensors for the measurement of gaseous sulphur emission (SO2, SO3 and H2S) suitable for application in the aggressive measurement condiions found in an industrial stack of a power plant or metal plant. This project will push the boundaries of solid electrolyte technology to the measurement of SO2, SO3 and H2S relevant to sulphur emission monitoring and control. It is based on innovative concepts of using solid electrolytes in chains for SO3 and coupled with catalysis for SO2 and a surface electrochemical decomposition reaction for H2S. This will make direct pollution measurements in an industrial stack possible for the first time, with the levels of selectivity, accuracy, drift stability and sensitivity demanded by the end user. It will open up the possibility of measurement of SO2, SO3 and H2S pollutant gases at the ppb level around the stack and in the community. Such technology is currently not available. The research team at University of Cambridge have tested several combinations of materials that are suitable for sensing of S gases in laboratory gas mixtures and have published the general concepts and results. For an industrial application, it is now important to select the correct combination of material and design as informed by the stack conditions and the specification required. A focussed applied research will be the starting phase of this pproject but in close collaboration with EMC Ltd who will manufacture the sensors and probes for industrial trials. Innovation is required to achieve the high levels of performance while keeping the materials such as the solid electrolyte, reference system, auxiliary electrode, catalysts and the probe materials stable and corrosion resistant over long periods of time. A suitable calibration system and on board diagnostics will also have to be advanced. This research team has considerable experience in participating in plant trials and in commercialisation of University research by technology transfer. The team has successfully transferred technology to EMC Ltd for world-wide markets in hydrogen and oxygen sensors and for on-board diagnostics for solid electrolyte sensors.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=DT/F002726/1","grantId":"DT/F002726/1","fundValue":"283011","fundStart":"2008-01-01","fundEnd":"2010-12-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Following this grant, a new project on CO2 sensing for demand ventilation control was developed and funded by Carbon Trust in collaboration with EMC Ltd and Ventaxia Ltd.
