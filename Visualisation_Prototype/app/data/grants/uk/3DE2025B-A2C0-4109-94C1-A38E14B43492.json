In effect, this project will add a cost-efficient smart layer\nacross the national power grid which will not only solve long-standing,\nindustry-wide challenges but will also open up countless other\nopportunities for stable, future-proofed growth as our cities and infrastructure become smarter and progress to the internet-of-things\nfuture.\nSince the low-voltage network was originally intended for one-way\ndistribution of energy, there has been little previous interest in\nmonitoring it. However, there is now a new imperative created by the\nimpact on network stability due to the growing deployment of consumer\noperated renewable distributed generation equipment, electric\nvehicles--- not to mention the 'exploding pavements' issue.\nCurrently, distributed generation amounts to only a small proportion of\nthe total network generating capacity, hence its impact on low-voltage\nnetwork performance is negligible. However, there is significant\nindustry concern about the effects of increased numbers of distributed\ngeneration and electric vehicle installations, especially when these are\nconcentrated in co-located clusters.\nThe low-voltage electricity network needs to be able to support two way\nelectrical flow and real-time communication. About 9% of electricity is\nlost in the distribution network, annually, and it has been reported\nthat 45% of Distribution Network Operator total network costs and 50% of\ncustomer minutes lost are due to low-voltage cable faults.\nManaging these new low carbon technologies present significant\nchallenges but early preparation and introduction of a Smart Grid should\nmake the transition easier and reduce overall costs. This project will\ndraw upon machine learning methodology to automatically monitor\nlow-voltage networks and detect and localise both known, and anomalous,\nproblem events. Furthermore, algorithms will also be progressed to\nsupport software-based protection and reconfiguration of the network.\nIt is anticipated that such smart sensor networks will make a\nsignificant contribution in network efficiency and future-proofing, and\nhave immense benefits for both consumers and EU/UK environmental and\nenergy policy targets.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/N508470/1","grantId":"EP/N508470/1","fundValue":"199296","fundStart":"2015-11-01","fundEnd":"2017-10-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"James Daniel Nelson","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
