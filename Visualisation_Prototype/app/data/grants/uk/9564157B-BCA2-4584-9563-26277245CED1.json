{"id":"9564157B-BCA2-4584-9563-26277245CED1","title":"A Workflow-based High Throughput Toolkit for Primer Design","abstractText":"The Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) is one of the core techniques of biotechnology. The technique allows the amplification of sections of DNA. This is useful in a wide variety of genetic manipulation or validation techniques. Primers are strands of nucleic acid that are used as starting points for the amplification in PCR. Primers must be designed to meet certain biological and physical constraints, in order that the reaction will succeed. The design constraints are complex enough that the software is needed to help biologists design efficient primers. Existing primer design software is not flexible enough to meet the ever more ambitious requirements of novel applications of PCR. For example, some applications of PCR may involve many primers concurrently, or staged reactions where primers are first used independently, and then joined as chimeras. We propose to develop a new primer design software toolkit that will meet the requirements of 21st century biotechnology. This will be flexible and extensible, and provide a library of components that can be put together in multiple combinations, coordinated by complex workflows, and available for programmers to use in automated environments. This toolkit will be made available as open source for bioinformaticians to tailor to the specific purposes of their laboratories.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/G024782/1","grantId":"BB/G024782/1","fundValue":"102878","fundStart":"2009-12-31","fundEnd":"2011-06-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Unlikely they've been used yet.

Commercial and forensic laboratories are all able to use this software library for primer design. Primer design is a necessity of most molecular biology laboratories. DNA amplification is used for identification (of species, or individual), for construction of new sequences (synthetic biology) and for other genetic manipulation techniques.
