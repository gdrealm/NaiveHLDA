{"id":"A0EB74B3-4DE4-4402-9C22-26E32A9B6D60","title":"Fine-tuning the picture: Learning from television","abstractText":"<p>Children begin attending to television from 9 months of age (Linebarger&nbsp;and Walker, 2005) and in Britain, 39 per cent&nbsp;of 3-year-olds watch 4-8 hours of televised programmes and videos a week (Reilly et al., 2003). This combination of an early presence and regular exposure creates the opportunity for television to provide substantial learning opportunities. At least into early childhood, however, less information is acquired from televised events than from real-life events (eg Hayne et al., 2003; DeLoache&nbsp;and Korac, 2003). Little is known about the long-term retention of information acquired from television or whether particular features of the presentation could be enhanced to improve learning. In a series of three experiments, visual and auditory features will be manipulated on pre-recorded video demonstrations to determine whether it is possible to facilitate the range of information 4-year-old children learn from television and to increase the verbal and behavioural recall of this information over the long-term. By examining the impact of simple special effects on learning and memory for televised information, the current studies will help researchers and educators develop and improve the quality of the educational videos that are available for young children.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-1939","grantId":"RES-000-22-1939","fundValue":"82281","fundStart":"2007-03-01","fundEnd":"2009-02-28","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  We have used the research from this study to develop resources for teaching parents how to care for their child's teeth and healthy eating Education Societal","person":"Jane Sheree Herbert","coPersons":["Mark  Blades"],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":" There were two key findings. 1) Children can remember and reproduce events they have seen on television after long delays. 2) Although television is a verbal and visual medium, young children appear to benefit more from additional verbal features, rather than visual features, when they are learning new information. In sum, television can provide children with educational opportunities. However their ability to remember this information is influenced by features incorporated into the video presentation. Consistent with learning from live demonstrations, a brief explanation of the target event presented on the video plays an important role in subsequent recall. Information about how to maximise learning from video/on line media can help develop effective resources for preparing children and families for upcoming events (for example, medical or educational events) Education","dataset":"gtr"}
