Ranging from in-depth qualitative studies of the processes underlying individual demographic behaviour through to complex statistical and economic modelling, the Centre's research brings methodological innovation to the study of population change in the UK.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-625-28-0001","grantId":"RES-625-28-0001","fundValue":"5388180","fundStart":"2009-01-01","fundEnd":"2013-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Jane Cecelia Falkingham","coPersons":["Paul  Boyle","Sue  Heath","Maria  Evandrou"],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
