{"id":"99DE9CC0-4B61-4302-89F2-92F48ACE1014","title":"Assembly of Artificial Oxidoreductases","abstractText":"Proteins are biological molecules constructed from linear chains of amino acids that adopt complex 3D structures informed by their amino acid sequence. Each protein typically has a unique structure that is indelibly linked to the function it performs in nature. Enzymes are proteins that catalyze the chemical reactions that occur in the cell, examples of which facilitate the capture and storage of chemical energy from respiration and photosynthesis. The design of new artificial proteins and enzymes remains one of the great challenges in biochemistry, testing our fundamental understanding of the nature of protein as a material. Unlocking the exceptionally powerful array of chemistries that natural enzymes perform promises routes to new drugs, therapies and sources of renewable green energy. Most attempts to construct new enzymes have focussed on modifying natural proteins and enzymes to introduce new catalytic function with modest degrees of success. The problems associated with redesigning natural proteins are due to the layers of complexity that nature incorporates through natural selection into a protein's complicated 3D structure. This complexity serves to complicate functional deconstruction of naturally evolved proteins and enzymes, rendering their redesign intrinsically difficult. We believe that this complexity is not a necessary feature of proteins and enzymes. Our method to effectively avoid such complexity is to work with proteins that have been untouched by natural selection. These simple proteins, neoproteins, are small, robust protein scaffolds with generic amino acid sequences that serve as templates onto which natural protein functions can be added. Non-protein components of certain proteins and enzymes, such as the heme molecule of the protein hemoglobin, can be effectively supported in neoproteins and the various functions that these molecules perform in natural proteins can be exploited. An example of how this method can be effectively used is the creation of a heme-binding neoprotein capable of reversibly binding oxygen, a function common to myoglobin, hemoglobin and the recently discovered neuroglobin. Functional elements of engineering are added step-by-step and the requirements to form such a protein are surprisingly few in number. And, as E. coli produces the artificial protein in large quantities, the oxygen-binding neoprotein is exceptionally cheap to produce and easy to alter through standard molecular biology techniques. Since the oxygen bound state in heme proteins is a pre-requisite for a multitude of catalytic processes in natural proteins, we plan to take inspiration from nature to further the development of these proteins into artificial enzymes. We have developed the oxygen-binding neoprotein to include hemes rigidly attached to the protein backbone. This alleviates problems associated with heme loss from previous designs and allows for an unprecedented control of neoprotein properties and function. Since natural oxygen-dependent catalysis requires that oxygen be 'activated' by the controlled addition of electrons, we will explore this reaction in our oxygen binding neoproteins, gaining valuable information about the generation and stability of intermediates capable of powerful oxygenic catalysis. Ultimately, we plan to combine the oxygen binding and electron delivery functions into either a single protein or a combination of associated protein subunits with discrete functions. Much as modular furniture design uses combinations of smaller functionally independent subunits such as legs, drawers, shelves and assembles them to particular specifications, we think an analogous approach can be applied to the construction of new proteins and enzymes whose functions are dictated by the designer. An advantage of this approach is that through the reproduction of enzyme and protein function in artificial proteins a deep fundamental understanding of the workings of their natural counterparts is gained.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I014063/1","grantId":"BB/I014063/1","fundValue":"294752","fundStart":"2011-09-01","fundEnd":"2014-08-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  During the tenure of the grant the impact of our work has been -to our knowledge - exclusively Academic in nature, though we have exceptionally promising results that came late in the funding period which we have yet to publish and to explore commercialisation. We have managed to develop effective, thermostable de novo protein catalysts that show excellent promise for industrial oxidations, oxygenations and dehalogenations. These enzymes are currently the most catalytically proficient examples of catalytic de novo proteins and we will strive both to publish our results in the highest impact journals and to explore industrial interest in our systems through our Research and Development department and through schemes such as SynBioCite.

These enzymes typically catalyse the net transfer of electrons to or from a substrate and many contain within them non-proteinaceous molecules that directly perform the chemical reaction that the enzyme catalyses. We began with a protein scaffold that we had engineered to bind one such cofactor - heme - and modified the protein to enable the full functional construction of protein and insertion of the cofactor in the bacterium E. coli. Having successfully achieved this (published in Chemical Science), we focussed on functional modulation of the cofactor molecule and protein scaffold to enable features of natural heme-containing enzymes to be imprinted on our manmade system: the charged surface of the protein was manipulated to promote protein:protein binding interactions; the protein was fused to a natural electron carrier to allow the flow of electrons to the heme from natural, abundant biomolecules; the protein was engineered to be structurally stable at elevated temperatures; a space was created in the protein above the heme to allow small oxygenic substrates to access a primitive active site. When some of these alterations were combined and integrated in a single protein, we were able to create a de novo protein that functions as a proficient enzyme, with a catalytic proficiency approaching that of natural enzymes. This proto-enzyme is promiscuous and, using modern directed evolution techniques, is capable of further semi-random in vivo development into a highly efficient enzyme that would be of major interest to chemical and biotechnological industry. Since the data was collected at the end of the grant tenure, we will strive to publish this work as soon as possible and we anticipate major impact surrounding publication of this work. As stated in our original pathways to impact document, we will explore possible commercialisation and patenting of our designed protein through the University of Bristol's Research Enterprise and Development department. Since our proteins could be of potential interest to the Chemical and Biotechnological Industries, we will also explore the possibility of partnering with Industry, through schemes which Bristol is currently involved with - such as SynBioCite - and also through the BBSRC-funded NIBBS, specifically the Metals in Biology NIBB of which I am a member. Following the success of this grant, my lab will be continuing this exciting research and I will be submitting a grants to the BBSRC and ERC for further development of these de novo protein catalysts, and my 2 BBSRC-funded PhD students will continue working on the project.
