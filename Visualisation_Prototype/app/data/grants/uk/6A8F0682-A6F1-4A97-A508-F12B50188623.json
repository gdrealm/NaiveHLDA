Copper, however, is potentially toxic if it binds to the wrong components of a cell. The amount of copper taken into cells is therefore carefully regulated so as not to cause damage. Central to this regulation is the ability of a cell to sense the amount of copper it needs and how much it has. Presently, we have little understanding of how this is achieved in complex organisms. We use bakers yeast as a model to analyse how cells sense metal ions as it has been shown that some aspects of this are conserved throughout biology. Our work has established that yeast treated with chemicals that cause DNA damage switch on genes that are involved in copper uptake. We want to understand why copper is needed under these conditions and identify the mechanisms that are used by yeast to activate copper uptake. We will compare these processes with those of another yeast, Cryptococcus neoformans, which causes a potentially fatal human disease.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/H006605/1","grantId":"BB/H006605/1","fundValue":"346487","fundStart":"2010-06-30","fundEnd":"2013-06-29","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The findings have been mainly used to promote interaction between our group and other research scientists. Importantly, this includes researchers at Syngenta that study plant pathogens. Through discussions at academic conferences and at Syngenta we have considered if our interests in fungal nutrient sensing are relevant to understanding how certain fungi are able to infect agricultural crops. These discussions have led us to direct our present research so that it is more directly relevant to the molecular mechanisms used by plant pathogens.

This metal is also potentially toxic to cells as it can displace other metals from their correct binding sites and can generate oxygen radicals that damage biological molecules. There are therefore mechanisms to ensure that cells import and distribute copper in a controlled manner. These mechanisms depend on the cell being able to sense how much copper is available and how much is needed for metabolism. In this study we identified that baker's yeast, a well understood model for molecular biological studies, imports copper when it senses DNA damage. An important regulator of the cells response to DNA damage, a protein called Rad53, was found to be required for activating the production of a copper importer. Initially this was counter intuitive as one might expect a cell to repress the import of a potentially toxic metal when it is experiencing DNA damage. However, we found that low copper conditions reduces the activity of a copper enzyme called Sod1 which is required for the Rad53 DNA damage pathway to function correctly. Yeast cells therefore import copper when they sense DNA damage to ensure that Sod1 is fully functional. We also showed that copper repress the storage of copper when they sense DNA damage in a Rad53 dependent manner. This work may have implications for many organisms as Sod1 and Rad53 are conserved throughout biology including in humans. There is potential to develop agents against both animal and plant fungal pathogens. In a recent Syngenta and BBSRC funded Industrial Partnership Award in which Rutherford was a co-investigator (BB/H011110/1) the molecular mechanisms of a copper-chelating fungicide generated by chemists at Syngenta were studied. A manuscript describing these studies has been published (Foster AW et al., Mol Microbiol. 2014 93:317-30). This collaboration has enabled Rutherford to take part in annual Syngenta hosted meetings that highlight Syngenta funded research. Through these meetings and subsequently, Rutherford has discussed with researchers at Syngenta the implications of the present study with regard the pathogenicity of certain plant fungal pathogens. These discussions have been very productive and have resulted in a new programme of research by Rutherford that focuses on signal transduction pathways that are involved in the infection of plants by fungal pathogens. These preliminary studies will form the basis of an application for research funding to the BBSRC Agriculture, Food and Drink,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
