Using qualitative and quantitative data, the project will examine the character, organisation and operation of the poor law in Ireland from the end of the Great Famine to the establishment of the Irish Free State. It will trace national and regional patterns in the provision and distribution of relief, and will explore the role of economic, social and political factors in the formulation and execution of national and local relief policies. Irish experiences of the poor law system will be examined in relation to welfare provision within the United Kingdom as a whole. At the same time, the impact of factors such as religion, national identity and regional economics on the scope and character of welfare practices in Ireland will be assessed. By analysing both general trends in relief policies and the micro-politics of relief, the project will provide a historical context for contemporary debates on the position of the poor and marginalised in Irish society, and will facilitate the integration of Ireland into the international history of European welfare.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-0181","grantId":"RES-062-23-0181","fundValue":"434866","fundStart":"2007-01-01","fundEnd":"2010-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Virginia Helen Crossman","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Oxford Brookes University","findingsText":" The project has produced new insights into the causes and experience of poverty in Ireland in the post-Famine period, and into the nature and operation of poor relief. It is now clear that there were significant differences in the way the poor law system operated in different parts of Ireland; levels of relief were highest in the south-east and lowest in the north. These differences reflected regional economies, but also social and cultural attitudes. Throughout the country, levels of poor relie The project identified patterns in the distribution of poor relief that indicated the existence of distinct welfare regimes in Ireland. There is potential for researchers to take this forward by investigating how the history of poor relief in their own locality fits in to the welfare regime model proposed by the project.
