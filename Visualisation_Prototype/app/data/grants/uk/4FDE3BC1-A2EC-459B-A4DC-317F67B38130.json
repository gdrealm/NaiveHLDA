Huge potential of demand side management can only be exploited by exploring new ways to induce shifts of demand during peaks and hence reduce marginal costs. Digital communication technology can play a vital role in inducing this shift by enabling communication between the devices and the users. A holistic view of the interaction of all key-players - energy devices, energy supplier and energy users - is missing and this project aims at investigating this interaction using a multidisciplinary research team. The overall objective of this research is to evaluate the feasibility of using network technologies and sensor devices now being used in telecommunications, to create a Persuasive Energy-conscious Network (PEN) in a real life pilot setting and then study the potential impact on user behaviour leading to reductions in, and shifts in patterns of, loads of electricity. The project will aim to quantify the savings in carbon footprint (and operational energy cost) of the pilot test-bed when digital technologies (PEN) are deployed. It will also study the response of the users of the proposed monitoring and control system. As part of this research project, we will establish an autonomous self learning network of the sensors, energy consuming devices and users of energy. Self descriptive devices will be enabled to send meta-data describing relevant details of their energy consumption and context (time, task urgency etc.). The network will collect the data and create an energy consumption knowledge-base. The novel middleware will be incorporated that will run the modules of self learning and decision making to trigger actions that will shape the energy demand using specified goals. For this purpose, we will use the University of Surrey campus as initial test-bed.Technological interventions are more likely to achieve the intended energy savings if the interventions are designed with an understanding of how users view and interact with their energy systems. Within psychology, a wealth of research is available which shows that the type and format of information given to users can have a strong influence on their response. We know very little about how individuals may respond to flexible intelligent systems. We aim to examine the behavioural responses to the implementation of intelligent technologies that aim to reduce energy use in buildings.There are various ways of incentivising consumers to change load patterns. One of them is through financial models aimed at fostering the demand responsiveness of consumers. Those consumers who proactively engage in reducing or shifting their loads and significantly react to price signals should be rewarded by paying less for their electricity consumption. Part of this research will focus on the development of a financial model for an incentive/payment scheme and testing such financial models on the campus test-bed.As an outcome of the research we will deliver a pilot test bed for the autonomous and self learning Persuasive Energy-conscious Network. The psychological studies will be reported on likely expected behavioural responses of the users to the proposed technologies. A financial model will be implemented and its impact on energy demand transformation will be provided with quantified results of savings in terms of energy cost and CO2 emissions.The research will have targeted collaboration with the users of research such as the industrial researchers (e.g. Thales Research and Technologies), individual energy users (University students and staff) and corporate users of energy (University of Surrey's Estates and Facilities) and government bodies (Woking Borough Council) to highlight the potential of using the digital technology in meeting the requirements of these players in this research.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I000232/1","grantId":"EP/I000232/1","fundValue":"1147550","fundStart":"2010-10-01","fundEnd":"2013-12-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Overall, this project has generated more than 60 research outputs which are listed on the Researchfish website (www.researchfish.com).

We approached this aim by evaluating the feasibility of using network technologies and sensor devices to study the potential impact on user behaviour in terms of reductions in, and shifts in patterns of electricity consumption. Additionally, the project aimed to quantify the reduction in carbon footprint (and operational energy cost) when such digital technologies are deployed.\n\nMethodology:\nData was obtained through a number of methods. Questionnaires and interviews were used to capture qualitative/quantitative data. To study the use of communications technology as part of the project’s aims, we developed a sensor network testbed which was constructed and deployed at the University’s Centre for Communications Systems Research, which consisted of a number of Persuasive Energy Network (PEN) units. These units are capable of measuring the energy consumed, presence, light levels, noise &amp;amp; temperature at each desk where a PEN unit was installed.\n\nCase-study:\nTwo distinct case studies were undertaken as part of the REDUCE project. The first was a trial conducted in an office setting with more than 150 PEN’s being installed at individual office desks. The goal was to study the participant’s energy usage behaviour, with some of the participants given the opportunity to receive feedback through a widget installed on their desk computer.\n\nThe second was a trial conducted in a residential setting consisting of ten households. During this trial, we explored financial incentive approaches to reducing peak electricity demand in the home. This was the first study on the use of specific financial incentives for load-shifting (as opposed to the introduction of new tariffs) in the residential sector. \n\nFindings:\nWe found that at least half of the electricity consumed by office PCs is when people are not at their desks. As much as 73% of electricity consumption by office PCs could be saved and, if all were switched off when the trial participants head home for the evening, an estimated &pound;60,000 could be saved annually. \n\nFor the residential trial, peak reductions as large as 27% were observed when reductions in energy use are also taken into account. As a result, the proportion of off-peak usage rose from an average of 30% to more than 40%. Although this was only a small-scale study, and further research is needed, this suggests that this incentives-based study was able to overcome some of the barriers to participation and response seen in Time-of-Use studies, although this was not solely due to the payments on offer. \n\nThe project has now been concluded. Following is a list of its key findings and outcomes:\n\n+ The recognition of individual appliance energy consumption from the aggregated consumption data can be significantly improved, especially for the low-power devices, making use of additional audio features as inputs in combination with energy features. \n\n+ Anomalies (e.g. in energy consumption patterns) can be detected with an improved accuracy using an algorithm that is capable of constructing optimal dynamic models for a training set that minimizes the detection error on the classification set.\n\n+ A novel distributed anomaly detection algorithm is developed that detects anomalous data in the measurements collected by the wireless sensor nodes. It achieves higher detection accuracy with a significant reduction in communication overhead in the network compared to centralised and existing schemes.\n\n+ The synthesis work of Centre for Environmantal Strategy indicates that a positive economic case exists for most of the key types of demand response, however the positive economic case relies upon at least a modest participation (including response) by energy consumers. A challenge will be to ensure the right environment to maximise participation (including response). \n\n+ Evidence that people’s interest in technology may be more important than their interest in environmentalism in determining their likelihood of using technology such as smart meter displays which can aid ‘green’ behaviours \n\n+ Evidence that self-determined or internal motivation is related to energy use at work, that is, that psychological factors play a role in how much energy people use in offices \n\n+ Evidence that both personal mental frameworks and social contexts influence whether people decide to switch off equipment such as computers in shared spaces \n\n+ Evidence that the physical context can guide people’s energy use, specifically if lights are off in a shared space, people are more likely to leave them off\n\nAs an outcome of the research we delivered a pilot test bed for the autonomous and self learning Persuasive Energy-conscious Network. This testbed was deployed on 100 desks in CCSR building in University of Surrey. This had impact on many other research projects involving IoT and smart city related research themes. The psychological studies were reported on the behavioural responses of the users to the proposed technologies. A paper in Energy Policy journal was published. Economic analysis investigated the framework models for demand response and energy demand transformations. Costs and benefits and CO2 reductions associated with different forms of demand response were also investigated and published in top quartile leading journals.
