The membrane coat is essential for maintaining the function of cells. It helps to keep water-soluble nutrients and essential components such as DNA inside the cell. Similarly, membranes block toxic substances from entering and damaging the cellular interior.\n\nA controlled exchange of ions/chemicals across the membrane is, however, key to support life and achieve higher function. Fresh nutrients have to be able to enter and support growth, while molecular cargo (e.g. antibodies) has to be exported from the production site inside human immune cells across the membrane to fight pathogens.\n\nControl over cellular entry and exit is executed by ion channels and membrane transporters. Ion channels are remarkable gatekeepers which play a vital role in nerve and muscle cells. They decide which types of ion pass across the membrane, and also open or close in response to chemical and physical stimuli. Dysfunction of the molecular structure can lead to dramatic health consequences such as cognitive impairment or neurological or muscular diseases. Ion channels in horticulture-damaging insects, by comparison, are of great agricultural interest as they represent a molecular 'Achilles heel' to be exploited in the development of insecticides. Furthermore, membrane transporters in bacteria can spread resistance-conferring genes to other pathogens. Finally, membrane-spanning pores are of interest in biotechnology where they are key components in next-generation sequencing devices for better and cheaper diagnosis of cancers.\n\nA detailed understanding of ion channels and membrane transporters is hence of tremendous significance to health, agriculture and the economy.\n\nOur proposal aims to achieve a step-change in the characterisation of the membrane channels. Conventional analysis techniques are slow due to their serial nature. The methods also require a considerable amount of manual involvement which can increase experimental variability and lead to unreliable scientific results. These bottlenecks will be overcome by new equipment to characterise ion channels and transporters in a highly parallel and automated fashion. Scientific data will be generated at high speed and unprecedented volume.\n\nThe output of our study will be manifold. Firstly, the new equipment will improve the scientific infrastructure of the partner universities and indeed all universities in Greater London as the devices will be the first in London. In addition, the equipment will have benefits in physiology and health by examining ion channels from the brain and heart to understand their molecular function and interaction with drugs. Similarly, bacterial translocation machines for DNA will be studied to understand the molecular mechanism for the spread of antibiotic resistance. In agriculture, the study of insect channels will help explain why different candidate insecticides are either activating or inhibiting. Finally, novel membrane pores will be developed for analytical and diagnostic devices.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/M012700/1","grantId":"BB/M012700/1","fundValue":"569843","fundStart":"2015-01-31","fundEnd":"2016-01-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Trevor Graeme  Smart","coPersons":["Stefan  Howorka","Gabriel  Waksman","Andrew  Tinker","Bonnie Ann Wallace"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
