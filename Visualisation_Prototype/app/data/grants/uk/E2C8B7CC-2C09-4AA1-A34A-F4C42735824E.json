It will compare the laws of Norway, Spain and the United Kingdom. Norway and Spain have introduced mandatory gender quotas but the United Kingdom leaves the issue for industry-based measures. This project will critically analyse the different measures and will comment on the most effective form of achieving equality in company management. The research will be published in major peer review journals and will be delivered in conference presentations to a broad audience including academics, government and industry representatives.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/F002262/1","grantId":"AH/F002262/1","fundValue":"25087","fundStart":"2008-03-01","fundEnd":"2008-06-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Charlotte Louise Villiers","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
