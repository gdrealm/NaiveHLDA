We have an ambitious plan to build in-house expertise in cell engineering tool generation, whole-cell modelling, computer-assisted design and construction of DNA and high-throughput phenotyping to enable synthetic biology in mammalian systems for multiple applications. In this way we will not only advance basic understanding of mammalian biology but also generate tools and technologies for near-term commercial exploitation in areas such as the pharmaceutical and drug testing industries, biosensing cell lines sensing disease biomarkers for diagnositics, novel therapeutics, production of protein based drugs e.g. antibodies and also programming stem cell development and differentiation for regenerative medicine applications. In parallel we will develop and implement new understanding of the social and economic impact of this far-reaching technology to ensure its benefits to society.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/M018040/1","grantId":"BB/M018040/1","fundValue":"11379900","fundStart":"2014-11-14","fundEnd":"2019-11-13","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Susan Jane Rosser","coPersons":["Steven Michael Pollard","Peter  Swain","Emma K Frow","William Charles  Earnshaw","Teuta  Pilizota","Yizhi  Cai","Adrian  Bird","Nacho  Molina","Jamie  Davies","Jane  Calvert","Charles  Ffrench-Constant","Vincent  Danos","Andrew John Millar","Alistair Philip, David Elfick","Joyce  Tait"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
