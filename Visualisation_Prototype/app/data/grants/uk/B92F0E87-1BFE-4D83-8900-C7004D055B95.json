We hope that, amongst other things, our work will shed light on the Birch-Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture, one of the most mysterious and challenging unsolved problems in number theory, which is related to one of the oldest problems in mathematics - that of determining the possible values of the area of a right angled triangle, the lengths of all of whose sides are rational numbers.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D057884/1","grantId":"EP/D057884/1","fundValue":"28056","fundStart":"2006-03-08","fundEnd":"2008-05-07","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Anthony James Scholl","coPersons":["John H Coates"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
