This problem is increasing as we have more people in the elderly at-risk age-group, but we do not yet fully understand why older people have poor healing. Skin wounds heal through a complex series of events, which are carefully regulated and involve several cell types. Our group have shown that the female hormone estrogen has a beneficial effect on healing, and acts upon all of the different cell types in a wound. Our understanding of the effects of age on the upper skin layer (the epidermis) and reformation of the outer skin barrier is particularly poor. Recent studies from our laboratory, comparing how wounds from old and young subjects heal, have identified cell adhesion in this upper skin layer (conferred by specialised structures called desmosomes) as a key process that leads to poor healing in the elderly. Furthermore, we have shown that desmosomes undergo specific changes after the skin is wounded. These new studies are essential to answer a number of important questions including how these changes are regulated and the implications for improving delayed healing in the elderly. Our work will initially use cultured cells and mice modified to express desmosomal proteins to understand the biology. This will direct experiments on human samples that will ultimately lead to the development of new treatments to accelerate healing in the elderly.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0800004","grantId":"G0800004","fundValue":"402753","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2012-08-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Matthew James Hardman","coPersons":["David Ronald Garrod"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
