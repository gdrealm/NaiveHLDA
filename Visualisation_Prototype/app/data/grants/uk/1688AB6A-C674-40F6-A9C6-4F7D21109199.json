This project explores how research outcomes from the ESRC Sustainable Flood Memories project can be materialised and cascaded in flood risk communities, and to organisational stakeholders in flood risk management (FRM), by developing community-generated digital storytelling (CDS) practice.</p>\n\n<p>The project involves co-working between the interdisciplinary team, and Environment Agency (EA), for mutual knowledge exchange and increased impact. The ESRC Sustainable Flood Memory project has explored the concept of sustainable flood memory (SFM) and its relationships with lay knowledge and community resilience. SFM, as an approach to memory research, is community focused, archival, integrating individual/collective experiences, involving communication within and between generations with concern for strategies for its future.</p>\n\n<p>This KE project will share diverse narratives about preparedness, drawn from semi-structured interviews with residents in different flood risk settings, and co-created into CDS (2-3 minutes audio with images).&nbsp; It will evaluate impacts of these CDS in catchments that are hydrologically similar or different. The projectâ€™s impact will be high in policy and practice, with its focus on increasing adaptive capacity and post-flood learning in communities&nbsp; - both neglected areas in flood education, and required for ownership of new devolved approaches to FRM.<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K00767X/1","grantId":"ES/K00767X/1","fundValue":"33525","fundStart":"2013-08-01","fundEnd":"2015-02-28","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Lindsey Jo  McEwen","coPersons":["Joanne Clare Garde-Hansen","Owain  Jones"],"organisation":"University of the West of England","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
