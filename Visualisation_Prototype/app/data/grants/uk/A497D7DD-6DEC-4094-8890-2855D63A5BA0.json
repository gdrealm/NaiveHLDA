The research will explore the meanings associated with home for residents of mobile homes and residential boats, as well as investigate residentsâ€™ perceptions of the constraints and opportunities presented by the institutional context. Further, the project will examine the attitudes of public and private sector agencies towards these types of accommodation, and assess the extent to which policy and the institutional environment has had an impact on enabling households to choose and sustain these accommodation choices. </p> \n<p>The research will use semi-structured qualitative interviews to address the research questions. Forty interviews will be conducted with residents of mobile homes, and forty interviews with people living on boats. In addition, up to 40 semi-structured qualitative interviews will also be conducted with a diverse range of agencies and organisations including national, regional and local government bodies, representative trade and business associations, representative resident bodies and financial institutions. The research will also analyse key documents produced by these agencies in relation to mobile homes and residential boats.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E024378/1","grantId":"ES/E024378/1","fundValue":"77195","fundStart":"2007-06-01","fundEnd":"2009-01-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Mark Alistair Bevan","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of York","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
