It is responsible for blood vessel growth in all tissues in human development from the embryo to the newborn child. It is also key to growth of tissues as children develop into adults, and in adults it is necessary in normal physiology during tissue remodelling (e..g in muscle growth in response to exercise) and in many diseases including cancer, diabetes and heart disease . Over the last three years, our research group has discovered that the way that cells edit together the message encoded by the gene that codes for the most important growth factor for blood vessels (called VEGF) results in two different families of proteins called VEGFxxx and VEGFxxxb. The VEGFxxxb family is widely expressed in normal human tissues, but switched off during angiogenesis, when the VEGFxxx family take over. The VEGFxxx family stimulates blood vessel growth, whereas the VEGFxxxb stops vessels growing, and we have recently identified many new functions of this family - they protects cells from injury, stop development of pain, maintain kidney function, and control fertility. It is now clear that this alternative editing (splicing) is controlled by cells, and appears to switch during angiogenesis and other cell stresses. However, little is known about how cells balance expression of the two families of isoforms by regulating splicing of VEGF in normal tissues. This area is beyond the scope of the medical research charities currently supporting our work to find out whether these isoforms can be used to treat cancers, heart disease, diabetes, pain, renal failure and other conditions. This project aims to determine the molecular and cellular pathways that regulate the balance of splicing of the VEGF mRNA. It will identify some of the molecules that control these splicing events, determine the sequences within the VEGF gene that are recognised by splicing factors, and identify how and where this splicing balance alters in live animals. It will do so using a new, cutting edge technology of in vivo splice reporters. These are synthetic DNA sequences that code for green or red proteins depending on which forms are made. These sequences can be used to follow in real time in live cells which way splicing is happening. This is the only way that splicing can be followed within a live single cell in response to treatments, to normal function, or growth or changes in animals. These new sequences are unique to the laboratory in Bristol, and we wish to exploit this advantage over competing groups in the USA to generate advances in scientific understanding from a UK base.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/J007293/1","grantId":"BB/J007293/1","fundValue":"473374","fundStart":"2012-04-01","fundEnd":"2013-04-07","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"David  Bates","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
