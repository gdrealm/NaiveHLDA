{"id":"EFF11753-27B8-4FB2-ADA8-C39428419AAC","title":"Commingled Biomaterials from Nature (COMBINE)","abstractText":"To achieve the overall objective the project is broken down into a series of inter-related technical tasks, each developing a step of the production process (and enabling technologies) needed to produce sustainable products. A number of routes will be investigated to ensure the technical development of the materials and components, starting with low end technologies such as film stacking through commingling and weaving of years, and finally investigating and developing moulding techniques for the case study components. The main output from this project will be sustainable structural parts manufactured entirely from renewable natural resources. Other key results will be structural woven natural fabrics, a compostable, bio-derived thermoplastic polymer fibre, and intimately mingled yarns/fabrics from these natural fibres and polymers. Research will be completed specifically on: Hemp and flax fibres will be carded and combed to provide suitable materials for spinning. Initially commercial available natural fibres will be investigated for compatibility with commercially available resin systems. Tests will be carried out on the characteristics of the commercial systems to check for suitability with the resin systems. Investigations into resin systems available, including traditional thermoplastic polymers and bio-derived thermoplastics. Both the systems investigated will be tested to provide detailed information on melt temperatures and flow, which in turn may provide insight into the capabilities of the systems to set out the developed fibres. The commercial systems studied will be tested for compatibility with the fibres. Innovative methods of spinning will be researched to provide structural natural fibre yarns with correct properties to allow impregnation and provide the structural properties required. Various methods of mingling will be employed to provide adequately mixed fibre and matrix systems.This task aslo involves the creation of a spun yarn with optimal twist for composite applications. Unlike textile applications where a high twist is used for composites a minimum twist is needed as high twist leads to off-axis loading of the fibres and hence a reduction in laminate properties as well as problems in yarn impregnation. Investigation into the weaving of the resultant optimised yarns will be completed in all systems. Investigation and development of the processing characteristics of the resin and fibres will be undertaken through processing methods including film stacking, vacuum consolidation and compression moulding. Resultant plaques formed will be tested for finishing techniques and enabling technologies such as joining. Recyclability and compostability will also be studied. Case study components will be specified and manufactured utilising appropriate processing methods, the completed components will then be tested against the traditional materials, such as glass fibre reinforced polyester, used to currently produce the components.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=DT/E00685X/1","grantId":"DT/E00685X/1","fundValue":"228793","fundStart":"2007-04-01","fundEnd":"2009-12-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Ton  Peijs","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Queen Mary, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
