However, whether or not vibration is judged to be excessive depends upon the criterion to be applied, that is, fatigue damage, discomfort or some other malfunction. Appropriate limits for the various problems will be investigated in detail in this project.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G00675X/1","grantId":"EP/G00675X/1","fundValue":"2338","fundStart":"2008-03-16","fundEnd":"2008-05-15","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Purnendu Kumar Das","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Strathclyde","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
