For example, abnormal vascular growth in the retina is a major complication in diseases such as diabetic retinopathy or age related macular degeneration and is the leading cause of blindness in the Western world. However, therapeutic intervention can only be achieved if we fully understand the biological principles of vascular development. Progress has been made in the last decade and some of the basic stop-and-go signals of vessel growth have been identified, but the mechanisms that lead to the complexity and diversity of a fully differentiated vascular tree are not well understood. \n\nIn this project we investigate how vessels differentiate into arteries or veins. To this end we use mice that have conditional mutations in certain genes, suspected to play a role in this process. The mutations can be activated with a drug (tamoxifen) allowing us to study the function of these genes at specific time points during development. This will help us to understand why the two vessel types behave differently during development and under pathological conditions. Such knowledge will form the basis for future therapies that target only specific blood vessel types and might allow us to manipulate the shape of the vascular tree.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0501711","grantId":"G0501711","fundValue":"364147","fundStart":"2006-09-11","fundEnd":"2009-09-10","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Marcus  Fruttiger","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
