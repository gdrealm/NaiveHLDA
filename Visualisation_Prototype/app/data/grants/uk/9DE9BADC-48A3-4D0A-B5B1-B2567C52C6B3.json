This has given rise to the rapidly developing area of spintronics. Currently the successful spintronic devices are all based on structures which contain alternating layers of magnetic and non-magnetic metals, and to date there have been considerable problems in developing successful spintronic devices containing semiconductors.\nSuch devices require a magnetic material which can form a junction with a semiconductor to selectively either inject or remove electrons with one particular spin orientation. Ideally, the material should work well at room temperature, not react chemically with the semiconductor and only inject one spin orientation. To date there is no material with fulfils all three criteria.\nHalf metals are types of magnetic material which have attracted considerable interest as potential semiconductor contacts. In a half metal, the bands for the two different spin electrons have quite different energies, so that the Fermi energy lies above the bottom of the Conduction Band for one spin orientation, but is below it for the other. For the first spin orientation the material behaves as a metal, while for the other it demonstrates all the typical semiconducting features, such as a bandgap.\nRecently it has been shown that compounds of certain transition metals with elements from group V or VI of the periodic table are half metallic when grown in the zinc blende crystal structure, which also means they can be grown as part of multilayer structures with more conventional semiconductors. However all of these compounds do not normally grow in this crystal structure which means that they have to be grown in a higher energy, metastable form.\nIn this proposal we have identified one of the most promising of these materials, which is the compound chromium selenide. This has many attractive properties and should satisfy all three criteria for a good contact material.\nDespite this, zinc blende CrSe has never been grown before. The aim of this proof of principle proposal is to demonstrate that CrSe can be grown in the zinc blende crystal structure by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). The structural properties (lattice constant, Poisson's ratio, etc) will be measured at Heriot-Watt University and samples will also be provided to Prof. Wolfram Heimbrodt at Philipps Universitaet, Marburg who will provide a basic assessment of the magnetic properties of the layers.\nIf this proposal demonstrates that CrSe can be produced with the zinc blende crystal structure and, as predicted thin layers are ferromagnetic above room temperature, then a subsequent full proposal will then be produced which will aim to exploit the properties of CrSe in a range of spintronic devices.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J001066/1","grantId":"EP/J001066/1","fundValue":"136012","fundStart":"2012-03-01","fundEnd":"2013-08-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Samples from this project have been\na) supplied to other Universities for optical and magnetic analysis (Marburg, Bath) and\nb) used within student projects at (structural characterization) Heriot-Watt University at both PhD and Undergraduate levels.\nc) Details of Analysis of samples, together with the growth method have been presented at an International Conference and a National UK meeting.\nd) Analysis of the magnetic properties of CrSe has allowed us to design structures using CrSe and its alloys with other elements to produce novel structures which can be incorporated in spintronic devices.

This material is of interest as it was predicted to be ferromagnetic up to room temperature and was identified as being a potential half-metal. This is a material in which electrons behave in different ways depending on the orientation of their spins - for one type the material is a metal, while for the other it is a semiconductor. \nGrowing chromium compounds by MBE is extremely challenging, requiring special material sources and our group has now developed considerable expertise through this grant which can be extended to other related materials. Analysis of the ultra-thin films produced was also not straightforward and in doing so we have improved our understanding of the use of X-ray techniques on such samples.\nDuring the period of the grant CrSe samples were successfully produced and supplied to Prof Heimbrodt. Extensive characterization of this material is still in progress, but preliminary results show that the layers are ferromagnetic, but with indications of multiple ferromagnetic phases. This behavior is not predicted by theory. The growth of these materials is of interest to crystal growers currently attempting to develop growth techniques for more challenging materials.\nthe magnetic properties of CrSe, once explored in detail, will be of considerable interest to the magnetic materials community, and in particular those theorists who routinely use the results from our materials to refine their computations.\nOur initial analysis of the material is that alloying CrSe with another element, either Mn, S or Te will modify the properties and allow the production of both half metals and room temperature ferromagnetic devices which can be used for spintronic applications. \nAs a result, we have recently submitted a grant proposal on extending this work together with Prof Heimbrodt and colleagues at Bath University.
