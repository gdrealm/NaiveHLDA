Combining these fields has potentially transformative implications for both and may generate a new field of Engineering Design. \n\nImagine a column of sand saturated with billions of engineered bacteria cells. As a force is applied to the top of the column, bacteria in the sand detect an increase in pressure. The bacteria respond by synthesising a new biological material to bind the grains together and resisting the load. The resulting structure would consist of a material where sand grains are only cemented where the forces through the material require.\n\nWe propose a proof of concept to show how we might design a manufacturing process where the material itself acts as manufacturer and designer, modelling and responding to its environment. Such a technology would push well beyond the current state of the art and challenge a new generation of engineering designers to think at multiple scales from molecular to the built environment and to anticipate civil engineering with living organisms.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/N005791/1","grantId":"EP/N005791/1","fundValue":"240435","fundStart":"2015-10-01","fundEnd":"2017-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Martyn  Dade-Robertson","coPersons":["Helen  Mitrani","MENG  ZHANG","Anil  Wipat"],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
