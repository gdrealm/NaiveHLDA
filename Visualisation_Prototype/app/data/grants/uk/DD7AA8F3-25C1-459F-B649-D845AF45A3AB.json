{"id":"DD7AA8F3-25C1-459F-B649-D845AF45A3AB","title":"Predicting extremes in complex systems: a statistical physics/data-based approach","abstractText":"This proposal aims to develop and explore novel mathematical and computational techniques for probabilistic prediction of extreme events in a complex dynamical system, from its recorded time series. It draws on ideas and concepts from applied nonlinear dynamical systems, nonlinear time series analysis and information theory. Specifically, we propose to develop three methodologies and explore their potential to improve prediction of extremes over more conventional methods: (i) introducing a metric in state space which measures distances between initial conditions as differences in information about the probability distribution of extremes using the concept of information geometry; (ii) systematic identification of precursors of extreme events by maximising mutual information; (iii) nonlinear regime-dependent prediction models.Two real-world applications will be tackled: (i) prediction of extremes in large-scale midlatitudinal atmospheric wave activity which is relevant to European storminess and (ii) prediction of turbulent gusts in the atmospheric boundary layer which is relevant to wind energy production.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H034005/1","grantId":"EP/H034005/1","fundValue":"101345","fundStart":"2010-08-01","fundEnd":"2012-12-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Frank  Kwasniok","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Exeter","findingsText":" The project was investigating the statistics, prediction and predictability of extremes in complex dynamical systems, focussing on data-driven approaches. Applications were in the area of weather and climate science. A flow-dependent statistical model for vorticity and wind speed extremes in the extra-tropical atmospheric circulation was derived by combining clustering algorithms with local extreme models. Probabilistic prediction of individual extreme events was studied by identifying precursory structures. Extreme model may be extended to precipitation. Environment","dataset":"gtr"}
