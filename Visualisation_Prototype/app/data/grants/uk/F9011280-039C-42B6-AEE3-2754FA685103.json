{"id":"F9011280-039C-42B6-AEE3-2754FA685103","title":"UK Mathematics-in-medicine study group: Loughborough University 2008","abstractText":"The aim of this proposal is to request funding for the 2008 Mathematics-in-Medicine Studygroup (MMSG) to be held at Loughborough University on 15th-19th September 2008. MMSGs have been held annually since 2000 and are multidisciplinary workshops at which mathematicians, biologists and clinicians collaborate on problems of genuine medical importance. They are normally attended by 50-60 participants, of which the majority are applied mathematicians at all stages of the academic spectrum. We expect 6 problems to be presented at the MMSG 2008 by biomedical researchers in which modelling input could significantly assist in their research. These problems are worked on throughout the week by the participants divided into interdisciplinary problem solving teams. Proceedings from the MMSG detailing general progress and results from each of the problems investigated will be produced and made available on a dedicated website. These reports often form the basis for journal publications and future collaboration. MMSGs have been very successful at developing new collaborations between mathematicians and biomedical researchers leading to numerous journal publications and grant applications and this proposal is therefore aimed at maintaining the momentum of these successful annual events.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G020450/1","grantId":"EP/G020450/1","fundValue":"15789","fundStart":"2008-08-01","fundEnd":"2008-11-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"John Peter Ward","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Loughborough University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
