The Mocker Swallowtail Papilio dardanus, a large butterfly widely distributed in subsaharan Africa, is a particularly striking example, because it expresses different morphological forms that each mimic a different model. From breeding studies it is well known that a single genetic locus controls the expression of different morphs. Here we aim to understand how this control functions on a molecular level. The first step is to obtain more information about the regulatory gene that is the apparent switch determining the colour morph. We have identified a particular gene region and a potential 'candidate' gene that is likely to be the desired portion of the genome, but further proof is needed. Here we employ a novel approach for associating the potential candidate gene with the phenotype, by testing the correlation of particular morphological types with a set of single nucleotide changes in the gene region of interest. This can be done by pooling wild-caught specimens of each kind and testing which of these DNA changes are common to them, yet are different from the others. A quantitative method for DNA sequencing ('pyrosequencing') will be used to test for these differences in DNA of different groups. The method will demonstrate a more widely applicable approach on how to associate obvious differences between living organisms and the genes producing these differences.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/D008484/1","grantId":"NE/D008484/1","fundValue":"53935","fundStart":"2006-07-01","fundEnd":"2007-01-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Alfried  Vogler","coPersons":["Chris David Jiggins"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":" This study led to the initial mapping of the switch locus of the Mocker Swallowtail, an established model for Darwinian evolution.
