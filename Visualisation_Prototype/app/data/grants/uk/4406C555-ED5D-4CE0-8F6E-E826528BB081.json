{"id":"4406C555-ED5D-4CE0-8F6E-E826528BB081","title":"HepData - a Data Curation Facility for Particle Physics","abstractText":"The successful interpretation of data from modern high energy physics experiments is a complex process. It involves not only the actual measurement of data points but also the input of a variety of theoretical or phenomenological models and processes which invariably rely heavily on numerous other data measurements for their tuning and refinement. New theoretical ideas lead to predictions that can be tested experimentally, and new experimental findings challenge theorists to produce better ideas. The HEPDATA project at the centre of this proposal serves to facilitate the data input provision to this process. At the same time, the Institute of Particle Physics Phenomenology (IPPP) in Durham, with its wide-ranging expertise in phenomenology and a strong base in particle theory, is ideally suited to be the host of this project.\n\nThe Data Curation aspect of the HEPDATA project will continue to compile HEP experimental scattering data and associated bibliographic information from particle physics experiments around the world. All the content on HEPDATA is freely available and easily accessible to the entire physics community, thereby promoting the data to a wide audience. In addition HEPDATA will continue its links with the SLAC/SPIRES database project, hosting its UK mirror and engaging with its replacement database Inspire, providing mirroring facilities in the long-term. The Berkeley Particle Data Group UK mirror web pages will also continue to be hosted by the project. HEPDATA will also continue to provide a server for Parton Distribution Function (PDF) codes and continue to develop and maintain the LHAPDF library of PDF functions which are used in a large part of present and future analyses including at the LHC.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/K001167/1","grantId":"ST/K001167/1","fundValue":"503188","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2016-09-30","funder":"STFC","impactText":"  The Durham HepData Project has for more than 30 years compiled the Reactions Database containing what can be loosely described as cross sections from HEP scattering experiments. The data comprise total and differential cross sections, structure functions, fragmentation functions, distributions of jet measures, polarisations, etc., from a wide range of interactions. They are all made publically available in the Reaction Data Database.\nHepData is funded by a grant from the STFC (UK) and is based at the IPPP at Durham University in the UK. The HepData team is very small comprising:\nDatabase Manager (Dr Mike Whalley, part-time, retiring)\nDatabase Manager (Dr Graeme Watt, since October 2013)\nCoding Assistant (Mrs Joanne Bentham)\nAn overview of the HepData project was presented in a talk (3 MB) at AAHEP7 on 2nd April 2014.
