{"id":"C7A6BB5C-5EC5-4FD8-94F4-B8B8F33BF8F0","title":"Delivering public services in the mixed economy of welfare: Putting research into practice","abstractText":"<p>The needs of citizens and the legislative requirements of the Government increasingly mean that public service organisations (local authorities, health trusts, and other agencies) must co-operate with the voluntary and community sector (VCS) to deliver and plan services. Interactive research is being undertaken in partnership with VCS organisations engaged in social welfare service delivery to older adults and policy makers in the East Midlands and the North East. Representatives from the VCS and policy makers are members of the Project Reference Group (PRG). The PRG is sharing experience and learning in order to generate new insight into good practice that is, or can be made, transferable. The second project aim is to recommend meaningful, shared criteria for the monitoring and evaluation of policy and practice in service delivery by VCSs. Resources will be trialled and refined via Learning Workshops.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-172-25-0051","grantId":"RES-172-25-0051","fundValue":"40039","fundStart":"2007-09-12","fundEnd":"2008-04-11","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  This impact grant fed into and application for funding for an ESRC seminar series, 2008-10, Re-mixing the economy of welfare: what is emerging beyond the market and the state, (RES-451-26-0495) The PI was Dr Sue Baines, Manchester Metropolitan University Education Policy & public services","person":"Irene  Hardill","coPersons":["Robert George Wilson","Susan  Baines"],"organisation":"Nottingham Trent University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
