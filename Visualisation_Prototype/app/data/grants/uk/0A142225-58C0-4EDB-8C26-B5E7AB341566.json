The purpose of this application is to design and construct systems-level models of metabolism in an animal comprising multiple organs with overlapping but appreciably different metabolic repertoires. Our core system is the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum, which bears obligate intracellular bacteria Buchnera aphidicola in a specialized organ, the bacteriome. The bacteria and bacteriome are treated as metabolic compartments that interact with the gut, fat body (the principal insect organ of intermediary metabolism) and embryos (accounting for up to 75% of the total biomass of aphids) via the insect circulatory system. Our modelling, thereby, explores the integration of metabolic networks across multiple components comprising two distinct genomes within a single organism. We particularly address two challenges: (1) To develop new algorithms leading to a better understanding of the structure of metabolic networks, improved routes to explore the networks systematically for extracting functional information, and a grasp of how such networks have arisen. (2) To devise multi-compartment models, using flux balance analysis, to explore the metabolic organisation of animals. The modeling process follows a step-wise increase in complexity and realism of metabolic integration, building from our previous metabolic reconstruction of Buchnera. The final model seeks to define the fully interactive metabolic network comprising Buchnera-aphid interactions in maternal tissues and embryos. In parallel, our models will be made available for use by the wider community.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F005342/1","grantId":"BB/F005342/1","fundValue":"402270","fundStart":"2008-03-01","fundEnd":"2011-02-28","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The data has been used to academics to demonstrate the metabolic basis of intracellular symbiotic relationships.

This used mathematical modelling methods combined with a series of experimental methods to test our computational models. Specifically, we have discovered how amino acids and nitrogen more generally is recycled between the host and its symbiont &amp; identified a series of potentially new drug target for reducing the spread of plant diseases by aphids. There is an clear need to understand how chemicals enter and leave the symbiont cell as this is not currently understood but must happen. Our papers in this area are being well cited in the symbiosis community as so few of these systems have been interrogated to the level that we were able to do in this work.
