We will test these two ideas against each other.\n<br />\n<br />In the generative model, we plan our tongue motion based on a set of shared mental objects and rules. It assumes that we are parsimonious with memory, computing on the fly.\n<br />\n<br />Exemplar models assume that people store many different examples of words, remembering more and computing less. You might remember many variants of &quot;dog&quot; from different people, in different circumstances. Similarly, when speaking, you choose among many stored patterns of tongue motion for each word.\n<br />\n<br />Exemplar and generative models make different predictions about the pronunciation of words that you have never spoken before.\n<br />Exemplar models predict that examples you hear may affect the way you say things. Classical (generative) models emphasize pre-existing rules and features. A new word would be pronounced in a stable, rule-governed way.&nbsp; We can distinguish these two models experimentally.\n<br />\n<br />Because the models are very different, if we can disprove one, we may have a substantial impact on our understanding of how the human mind produces language.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F036795/1","grantId":"ES/F036795/1","fundValue":"346593","fundStart":"2008-09-01","fundEnd":"2011-08-15","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Greg Peter Kochanski","coPersons":["John  Coleman"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
