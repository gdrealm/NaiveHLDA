{"id":"635B0F6B-844C-4D4D-8E56-CBD0F0DD5821","title":"Spectroscopic imaging of skin and its application to (trans)dermal delivery","abstractText":"We propose to develop applications of advanced spectroscopic methods (FTIR imaging and confocal Raman microscopy) for studying (trans)dermal delivery. These methods will be combined with the use of multivariate chemometrics for enhanced data analysis. The research is based on a unique opportunity of bringing 3 research groups together that can elucidate mechanisms of percutaneous absorption. The spectroscopic expertise will be combined with groups specializing in drug delivery and pharmaceutical analysis. The programme of work will explore applications of FTIR imaging in micro- and macro ATR imaging modes to skin samples in contact with formulations. Macro-ATR imaging will be applied for the first time to study in situ dynamic process of permeation of model formulations through the skin. A broader goal is to facilitate the use of FTIR imaging for skin research by revealing the underlying mechanisms of mass transport through the various strata of the skin. The combined application of FTIR imaging, confocal Raman spectroscopy and advanced chemometrics techniques to skin samples will provide a valuable database for the better design of medicines for skin treatment.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D502721/1","grantId":"EP/D502721/1","fundValue":"176708","fundStart":"2006-02-15","fundEnd":"2008-11-14","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Sergei G.
