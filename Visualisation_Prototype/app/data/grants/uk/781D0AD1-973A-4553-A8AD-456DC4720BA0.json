Pioneering studies produces by Spanish, French, and American scholars have tended on the whole to be relatively narrow in focus or to concentrate for the most part in the last three centuries. The Gypsies of Early Modern Spain, 1425-1783 (Basingstoke: Palgrave-Macmillan, 2007) is the first historical study in English of Spain's gypsies of the late medieval and early modern periods. Drawing extensively on the author's archival research in Spain, it reconstruct the first three and a half centuries there are people who, despite their elevation by non-Spaniards to culturally iconic status in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, have until now remained largely invisible to history in the English-speaking world.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=111704/1","grantId":"111704/1","fundValue":"11476","fundStart":"2006-01-16","fundEnd":"2006-04-15","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Richard  Pym","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Royal Holloway, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
