This project first pursued this question by considering, conceptually, how entrepreneurship opportunities relate to a person’s experience of social structures across their life course. These ideas have then been tested by modelling how both business start-up and entrepreneur earnings relate to a person’s class-structured opportunity to accrue resources across their life course. We have also tested the effect that a person’s family role has on their ability to apply their resources to exploiting opportunities through entrepreneurship.</p>\n\n<p>Our analysis is highly robust, modelling individual, household and business life course pathways into and through entrepreneurship by drawing on 18 waves of the British Household Panel Survey (1991-2008) using event history analysis and growth curve modelling.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Our findings suggest strong class based pathways to business start-up and that family roles have a significant effect on both business start-up and earnings. The relationship between entrepreneur earnings and class is less obvious; this may mean that entrepreneurship is a relatively open route of opportunity or it may be that class-based privileges are obscured in our analysis because the wealthy are not motivated to apply their resources efficiently to entrepreneurship. New directions for research are indicated.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/G022356/1","grantId":"ES/G022356/1","fundValue":"80480","fundStart":"2009-01-01","fundEnd":"2011-05-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Dilani  Jayawarna","coPersons":["Julia  Rouse"],"organisation":"Manchester Metropolitan University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
