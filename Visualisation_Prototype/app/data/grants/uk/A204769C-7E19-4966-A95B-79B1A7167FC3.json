{"id":"A204769C-7E19-4966-A95B-79B1A7167FC3","title":"An Edition of John Milton's Divorce Tracts","abstractText":"This project will bring to a conclusion a new edition of John Milton's Divorce Tracts, his four prose pamphlets published between August 1643 and March 1645. These prose works constitute a body of work in Milton's canon that has been unjustly cordoned off from his political activism. This project sees these works as representing a significant development in Milton's theorizing of individual and domestic liberty, and the proposed research and editing contributes not only to a re-think of Milton's literary and political development, but enhances our understanding of civil war period politics, theology, social and sexual reform, and the scope of free speech. In these writings on divorce, Milton broke with his former allies (the Presbyterians) and found himself subject to Parliamentary censure. Their content daringly challenges religious orthodoxy in terms of doctrine and discipline; conceptualises marriage and the experience of the body and its needs for a post-Sacramental theology and practice. The ideas formed here are foundational to the author's concerns with the relations between the sexes that appear later in his major poetry, Paradise Lost and Samson Agonists.\n\nThese works are in sore need of editing up to current standards of bibliography and scholarship. The proposed edition offers an occasion to set Milton's texts in the processes of their material production, and to highlight their entitlements with politics, religion, literary genre, and printing history. In recent years, there has been a revolution and aims in editing, away from the author-centered approaches and towards understanding the works in their embedded social discourse. \nThis matter is especially relevant to the editing of Milton's divorce works, since these were produced in polemical debate with other writers, with circumstance, and in response to the Westminster Assembly and Parliament's censorship. \nThe four tracts have appeared in two modern editions: without annotation by Columbia University Press (1931-38), and with historical annotations by Yale University Press (1959), though these editions were based on collation of a very small sample of copies and lacked a thorough investigation into the printing histories of these works. \nMy new research not only builds upon more recent scholarship in Milton and in history, but also takes into account gains in editing practice and bibliographical theory. The resulting edition will, for the first time, present the two differing texts of Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce (1643; 1644).\n\nBy editing anew, the aim is to re-think Milton's early development as a political writer, and also to offer a culturally&shy; robust account of the production of his texts in their political and cultural moment. One aim of my re&shy; contextualization will be to redress the current portrait that sees them as the singular (and bizarre) aspect of Milton, who wrote them because his wife abandoned him. With this new research we will find that these tracts, with their domestic concerns, were part of mainstream political and religious debate, and that they are vital to understanding Milton's ideas of humanity.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/E506186/1","grantId":"AH/E506186/1","fundValue":"23480","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2007-12-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Sharon  Achinstein","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
