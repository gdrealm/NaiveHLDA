We will forward our learning from Phase 1 into Phase 2 projects:\n\n1. we will set up a fund that current and previous NERC grant holders, researchers and students can bid into for projects that will strengthen interaction with stakeholders, generally businesses, to accelerate impact\n2. a Business Relationship Specialist from our Research and Enterprise Department will work closely with successful applicants to support and facilities project deliverables\n\nProjects are expected to be varied, though outputs will consistently aim to: \n\n1. build on developing relationships made possible by the Phase 1 Pilot, as well as to stimulate relationships/product development as appropriate \n2. create opportunities for additional new dialogues between University and targeted stakeholders that will enable mutual exploration of impact related activities\n3. highlighted the potential of NERC funded research in terms of economic and societal benefits \n4. provide evidence for case studies\n\nSupport for cross-project activities will be brought together through a new Strategic Environmental Programme currently under development. Our vision for the Programme will link the University's world leading NERC funded expertise in climate sciences, earth observation and environmental risk as well as food security. The overarching programme is still being developed, but it aims to undertake R &amp; D relevant to business growth and deliver real benefit and impact for our societal and industrial partners, drawing across our diverse cross-disciplinary research base. \n\nWe aim to develop at least 5 high quality case studies on the impact of Reading NERC funded science and engage an experienced case study writer to do so. It is envisaged that the case studies will be web based with photographs and videos as appropriate to give them the widest appeal and reach. In addition we aim to identify potential for impact from CASE Studentships and KE Fellowships so that a pipeline of suitable case studies can be identified for future development. \n\nOverall the NERC IAA will be monitored and closely aligned to required deliverables by the Business Relationship Specialist and a Panel which will include The Dean of Science, the Dean of Life Sciences, Director of Research &amp; Enterprise and a Member of the University's Impact Strategy Team.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/L012839/1","grantId":"NE/L012839/1","fundValue":"201620","fundStart":"2013-11-01","fundEnd":"2013-11-11","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Anne-Marie  Van Dodeweerd","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Reading","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
