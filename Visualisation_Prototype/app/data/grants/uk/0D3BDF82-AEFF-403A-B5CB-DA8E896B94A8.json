{"id":"0D3BDF82-AEFF-403A-B5CB-DA8E896B94A8","title":"The intensification of livestock production and its impact on zoonotic disease risk","abstractText":"In the past 20 years, 177 different human diseases have appeared for the first time or re-emerged as threats to health. Of these, 73% are zoonotic, that is diseases which have moved from animal hosts to human hosts. Many of these have done so via livestock (pig, chicken, cattle) production and distribution ? examples include SARS, bird and swine flu. These diseases are significant in both animal production systems, where they limit productivity and capacity to export, and of course in human health, but researchers in animal and human disease systems do not work together on these. Nor is there significant cooperation between government agricultural and health departments in monitoring zoonotic diseases emerging in animal production and moving into human populations. \nWithout such collaboration, we will not understand the conditions that cause zoonotic pathogens to arise in (or move through) animal production systems into human populations and spread there. We suspect the factors that cause this to happen are complex. Some are biological and ecological, such as contact of livestock with disease wildlife, while others are economic, such as the rapid growth in livestock production and movement. \nWe will bring together researchers on zoonotic diseases from across the animal-human health sector divide, and from different disciplines ? biology, economics, sociology, etc. We will focus our work on Asia, where zoonotic diseases are appearing most regularly and spreading to the rest of the world. We will engage zoonotic disease researchers from across East and Southeast Asia, who are currently collaborating with the UK groups leading this project. \nThrough shared papers and workshops, participants will first frame questions to ask about how zoonotic disease emerge, and then design short research projects to gather data for analysis. From this analysis, they will develop a conceptual model for how these different factors affect zoonotic disease emergence. This will lead to a research proposal to test the project?s hypothesis that changing animal production is increasing disease risk. It will also produce a publication, to guide other researchers in taking inter-disciplinary and inter-sectoral approaches to zoonotic disease. This publication will reach Asian and African collaborators involved in the project, so that they may use it to help build their own national zoonotic research projects in a way that best supports development of cross-cutting solutions across sectors and informs decision makers in government.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0902453","grantId":"G0902453","fundValue":"50000","fundStart":"2010-05-01","fundEnd":"2011-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Richard  Coker","coPersons":["Dirk  Pfeiffer","Brendan  Wren","Ian  Scoones","Michael  Loevinsohn","Alexandra  Conseil","Pratap  Singhasivanon","Mark Marini RWEYEMAMU","Richard  Smith","Abigail Louise Woods","Sarah  Dry","Melissa  Leach","Jeffrey  Waage","Jonathan  Rushton","Anthony Spencer Barnett","Gerald  Bloom"],"organisation":"London Sch of Hygiene and Trop Medicine","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
