{"id":"A57A7BA4-C5F3-4473-A758-B82ED92DE73B","title":"Preparing MethodBox for National Service","abstractText":"<p>This is a project to deliver a new on-line system for bringing different researchers together to share their expertise and work together on complex social problems. It is important to have different disciplines working together because they have different strengths and weaknesses. For example a Social Scientist studying social factors in obesity may have excellent knowledge of how to measure socio-economic status whereas an Epidemiologist may have complementary knowledge about whether to use Body Mass Index or waist-to-hip ratio as the measure of obesity.&nbsp; To this end we developed a prototype system called MethodBox.<br /><br />Studies of the prototype have shown it is very popular with users from a wide range of backgrounds. By examining the way people use the system we can see that it could be developed further: moving from a simple system to help people find the data they are looking for to a more complex system that raises awareness of data and methods the researcher may not have considered. This is particularly important with the growth in scientific knowledge because it is becoming less realistic for a researcher to have read all relevant papers before they start their research.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J010014/1","grantId":"ES/J010014/1","fundValue":"39925","fundStart":"2012-03-01","fundEnd":"2012-07-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  The findings which the funding for Methodbox provided delivered key information which has informed a key theme in the HeRC programme (CHIP-SET).
