Assessing The Impact of Greater Scottish Autonomy on the North of England","abstractText":"<p>This proposal provides a timely opportunity to focus on an aspect of the debate on Scottish Independence that is of growing political salience but which, as yet, remains an underdeveloped research area: namely, the impact of greater Scottish autonomy on the neighbouring North of England. Such a focus will allow for both a range of conceptual debates on territorial approaches to economic development, fiscal federalism, the nature and fluidity of 'borders' and the creation of more flexible approaches to governance; and the potential to shape policy-making in an area and at a time where the nature of the inter-relationship (and the opportunities it offers) remains to be decided.<br /><br />The seminar series will consist of six events over a two year period.The topics to be covered are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>the historical and cultural context</li>\n\n <li>developments in governance and governing</li>\n\n <li>economic development</li>\n\n <li>changes in levels of fiscal autonomy</li>\n\n <li>lessons from international experiences</li>\n\n <li>implications for politics and policy-making.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>&nbsp;In addition to academics, the engagement of practitioners and policy-makers is also a feature of the series. The last event, timed to take place early in 2015, will allow for post-referendum reflection and analysis which engages politicians and policy-makers from both sides of the Border.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L001446/1","grantId":"ES/L001446/1","fundValue":"16558","fundStart":"2013-12-01","fundEnd":"2015-11-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Keith  Shaw","coPersons":["Angela Joyce McClanahan","Iain  McLean","Frank  Peck","John  Tomaney","Ysanne Hope  Holt"],"organisation":"Northumbria University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
