Despite the importance of antibiotics, relatively little is understood about how these bacteria coordinate the activities of all the components of the machinery that make these compounds. Recent discoveries have revealed that the antibiotics themselves and intermediate compounds in the antibiotic pathways control the activities of key regulators (called 'transcription factors') that switch the genetic machinery of these useful bacteria to coordinate and integrate the production of antibiotics. The aim of this work is to find out exactly how these regulators work at the molecular level, how their activities are controlled, and how this serves to coordinate and integrate the synthesis of the antibiotics. We will perform these experiments in a model system on an antibiotic called simocyclinone, which is not yet used in human medicine. However, since there is strong evidence that the signalling mechanisms we are studying are widespread in antibiotic-producing streptomycetes, our results might allow pharmaceutical companies to make knowledge-based improvements in the yield of commercially important antibiotics that are used in human medicine, potentially making them less expensive and more widely available.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I002197/1","grantId":"BB/I002197/1","fundValue":"462572","fundStart":"2011-04-04","fundEnd":"2014-04-03","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Since there is now strong evidence that the metabolite signalling mechanisms we have investigated are likely to be widespread within streptomycete antibiotic biosynthetic pathways, our results are likely to prove relevant to knowledge-based improvements in the yield of commercially important antibiotics.

Simocyclinone is a potent inhibitor of DNA gyrase made by Streptomyces antibioticus. In this, we identified simR, encoding a TetR-like repressor, and the divergently transcribed simX, encoding a proton-dependent efflux pump, as the resistance genes associated with the antibiotic biosynthetic cluster in S. antibioticus. We showed that transcription of simX is controlled by SimR, which directly represses the simX and simR promoters by binding to two operator sites in the simX-simR intergenic region. Most importantly, we showed that simocyclinone abolishes DNA binding by SimR, providing an intimate mechanism that couples the biosynthesis of simocyclinone to its export. In addition, we showed that the biosynthetic intermediate, C4, which is inactive as a DNA gyrase inhibitor, also induces simX expression in vivo and relieves simX repression by SimR in vitro. \n\nIn order to understand the mechanism of simocyclinone-mediated derepression, in a second paper, we went on to solve 3 crystal structures: (i) SimR alone, (ii) SimR in complex with simocyclinone, and (iii) SimR in complex with the pathway intermediate C4. In addition to a conventional helix-turn-helix (HTH) DNA-binding motif, SimR carries a novel N-terminal extension that is absent from other studied members of the TetR-family. In solving the crystal structures of SimR alone and in complex with the antibiotic, we saw that this N-terminal extension was not ordered, yet when we deleted the disordered residues we found that DNA-binding affinity was reduced &gt;100-fold. As a consequence, we decided to perform protease protection experiments, through which we showed that the N-terminal extension is hypersensitive to trypsin, but that it becomes protease-resistant upon DNA binding. From this, we concluded that the novel N-terminal extension must be involved in DNA binding. To see if this were true, we crystallised and solved the structure of the SimR-DNA complex, and discovered that the N-terminal extension of SimR binds in the minor groove adjacent to the major groove occupied by the classical HTH motif. This binding to the minor groove is mediated through arginine residues that sit at the tip of the N-terminal extension. We then carried out a comprehensive bioinformatic analysis of all known TetR family regulators (TFRs) and showed that an N-terminal extension rich in positively charged residues is a previously unrecognised feature of the majority of TFRs, suggesting they will all make use of the minor groove binding mechanism we discovered. \n\nHaving the structures of (i) SimR alone, (ii) the SimR-antibiotic complex and (iii) the SimR-DNA complex allowed us to understand the mechanism of simocyclinone-mediated derepression. Firstly, it became clear that the conformational changes associated with antibiotic-mediated derepression result from rigid-body rotation of the two subunits about the dimer interface. The binding of simocyclinone captures a conformational state in which the two recognition helices are 42 &Aring; apart, a spacing that is not compatible with binding to two consecutive major grooves. The rigid body rotation that is required to bring two recognition helices 37 &Aring; apart (the distance seen in the DNA-bound state), is prevented in the ligand-bound structure by the antibiotic threading through both subunits, acting as a locking pin, and, in a related mechanism, by the inter-digitation of the Arg122 side chains, which project across the dimer interface into pockets in the surfaces of the opposing monomers, effectively locking the subunits together. Since there is now strong evidence that metabolite signalling mechanisms like those we have studied are likely to be widespread within streptomycete antibiotic biosynthetic pathways, our results could prove relevant to knowledge-based improvements in the yield of commercially important antibiotics. Streptomycetes account for ~80% of commercially important antibiotics, and are also a rich source of other types of bioactive molecules such as anticancer agents and immunosuppressants, currently accounting for ~$40 billion of annual revenue annually in the pharmaceutical industry worldwide.
