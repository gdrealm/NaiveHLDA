{"id":"5E96712A-90B6-4FB1-8145-A7ACC308E6C5","title":"Empowering the user: the development of flexible archival catalogues","abstractText":"This project aims to enhance archival cataloguing procedures, bringing them into line with the demands of twenty-first century researchers. It will develop the creation of dynamic and flexible online archival finding aids that are responsive to user-needs allowing individual researchers to tailor catalogues to their own specific research. A report into the value of such a flexible approach will be produced. The project will use as a test bed, and provide a greatly enhanced research resource to, the outstanding House of Fraser Department Store archive relating to British design, fashion and culture from the early nineteenth to the end of the twentieth century.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=119231/1","grantId":"119231/1","fundValue":"211005","fundStart":"2006-05-01","fundEnd":"2009-04-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Lesley  Richmond","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
