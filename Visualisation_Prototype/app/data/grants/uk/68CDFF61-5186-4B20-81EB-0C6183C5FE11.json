A carrier is defined as an animal from which live virus can be recovered for longer than 28 days after exposure. There is considerable field evidence to indicate that these carrier animals may precipitate new outbreaks of disease and their occurrence significantly constrains trade in live susceptible animals and their products. FMD remains the single most important constraint to international trade in live animals and animal products. Outbreaks prevent developing countries from gaining access to lucrative export markets and within the developed world where the disease has been eradicated the reappearance of the disease can still cause devastating economic consequences as was vividly demonstrated in the UK in 2001. Despite its profound impact on animal health, the factors that regulate pathogenesis and persistence are still poorly understood. During the acute phase of FMD, FMDV rapidly infects cells and produces lesions on the tongue and foot covered skin that has a layer of dead cells. We have shown that samples collected from these sites contain the highest levels of virus. In contrast, there are no lesions in the throat and soft palate covered by skin that has no layer of dead cells even when they have high levels of virus. In addition, we have shown that FMDV were predominantly present in the deeper layers of skin tissue of both tongue and foot during disease and in the soft palate during persistence. The reasons for why the virus cannot produce lesions in the soft palate skin despite their presence in the deep skin layer are not understood. It is possible that infection of the soft palate skin involves a slower rate of viral growth that does not lead to the production of observable lesions. This could be because the cells are at a different stage of division or differentiation or that the cells in these tissues are different. Even though these are attractive possibilities the necessary studies aimed at answering these questions using animals infected with FMDV have not been carried out. Therefore, this proposal seeks to understand precisely the association between cell type, cell status, virus growth and outcome of infection. This may reveal why lesions do not occur at the soft palate and provide an explanation as to why the virus remains in this type of skin for longer without causing damage while it can be cleared from other skin even though it has been damaged.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E003435/1","grantId":"BB/E003435/1","fundValue":"484125","fundStart":"2007-01-10","fundEnd":"2011-01-09","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Bryan  Charleston","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The Pirbright Institute","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
