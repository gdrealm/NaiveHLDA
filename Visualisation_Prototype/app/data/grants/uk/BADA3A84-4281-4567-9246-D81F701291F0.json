{"id":"BADA3A84-4281-4567-9246-D81F701291F0","title":"Haptic Technology Enhanced Learning: HapTEL","abstractText":"<p>The overall aim of the&nbsp;hapTEL project is to develop and evaluate haptic and synthetic online devices which will be used by a range of dental students and professionals to transform the quality of their learning. Haptics is the study of human touch and interaction with the external environment via touch. The project will involve working with a wide range of students who are either studying to become dentists or as dental practitioners (dental nurses, hygienists etc.) or improving their professional practice. A common need is that they have to acquire and improve their skills in treating teeth. By practising as many times as they like on a very realistic virtual patient they can achieve this without the worry of causing harm, embarrassment or fear. </p>\n\n<p>The projectâ€™s work is in 3 Strands:</p>\n\n<p>Strand 1 - the technical strand involves the development and refinement of haptic devices and online simulations;</p>\n\n<p>Strand 2 - the curriculum strand involves developing and refining the dental curriculum and associated teaching strategies through a blended learning approach;</p>\n\n<p>Strand 3 - the educational evaluation strand to measure the impact of the Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL) devices on teaching, learning and curriculum integration.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E020224/1","grantId":"ES/E020224/1","fundValue":"1117690","fundStart":"2007-07-01","fundEnd":"2011-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Margaret Josephine Cox","coPersons":["Jonathon Timothy Newton","Chris  Louca","J  Hindmarsh","Mark John Woolford","Brett  Robinson","Patricia Ann Reynolds","Stephen  Dunne","Nairn  Wilson","Brian James Millar","William  Harwin","Bruce  Elson"],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
