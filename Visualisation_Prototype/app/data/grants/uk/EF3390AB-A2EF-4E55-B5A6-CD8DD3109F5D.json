{"id":"EF3390AB-A2EF-4E55-B5A6-CD8DD3109F5D","title":"Education, Labour Supply and Marriage","abstractText":"<p>Policies aimed at alleviating poverty and improving childrenâ€™s opportunities form the backbone of most welfare programmes. But poverty and underachievement are not well understood, often resulting in poorly designed policies that fail to deliver.</p>\n\n<p>Economic and social wellbeing result from a complex net of lifecycle decisions by individuals and families. Three decisions are crucial and closely intertwined: education, labour supply and marriage. The importance of their links has been demonstrated by past research, but not investigated in a common framework capable of dealing with their interconnections and interplay with the welfare system.</p>\n\n<p>This project will contribute to the understanding of major lifecycle decisions, their consequences for individual and family wellbeing and implications for policy design. A novel rich lifecycle model of education, labour supply, marriage and intra-household allocation of resources will produce new systematic evidence on the connections between these critical decisions, their consequences for wellbeing, their relevance for welfare policy design and their empirical significance in countries like the UK, US and Sweden. The joint consideration of the decision making process and of the main features of modern tax systems will support a formal discussion of policies for families and contribute to inform policy making.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K00624X/1","grantId":"ES/K00624X/1","fundValue":"285627","fundStart":"2013-05-01","fundEnd":"2017-02-28","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Monica Costa Dias","coPersons":["Constantine Hector Meghir","Jerome  Adda","Pierre Andre  Chiappori"],"organisation":"Institute for Fiscal Studies","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
