{"id":"CCAF77DA-54DF-4A65-BD12-617993911B42","title":"Reconceptualising International Volunteering","abstractText":"Volunteering as a concept is a phenomenon found across the globe as an integral part of the majority of societies. International volunteering is described predominantly in two domains; one associated with international tourism (volunteer tourism, voluntourism - a more recent phenomena) and the other with international development. There are also aspects that cross these domains, for example: diaspora volunteering, health volunteering, and humanitarian volunteering increasing the complexity. What is clear is that in economically challenging times, volunteering effort is considered an essential component in delivering a better quality of life, protecting the environment, assisting less-privileged societies and developing responsible citizens for future generations. But there is also criticism: that the resources contributed by volunteers could be better used; that volunteers can be ill-equipped and exposed to unnecessary danger; that the receiving community fails to benefit adequately from the volunteers effort; and that not all companies offer the same quality of experience and ethical values.\n\n'Volunteering', 'development' and 'tourism' have all been discussed within national (domestic) and international contexts and underpinned by a range of disciplines, most notably sociology, development studies, leisure studies, tourism studies and management and business studies. However what is less evident are discussions bringing these fields together and opening up debate about the overlaps and mismatches between the volunteering experience in practice and the purported theoretical underpinning. These mismatches are also evident in practitioner debates where not-for-profit companies (predominantly associated with development initiatives) criticise more commercial tourism operators, only to change their own services later to stay competitive in a complex, fragmented and changing marketplace. The growing levels of criticism around international volunteering are evident in many arenas; in academic literature, practitioner comments and media reports.\nIndividuals, practitioners, communities and governments as well as researchers therefore need to engage in 'reconceptualising' their perceptions of volunteering and particularly international volunteering as both a theoretical and a practical undertaking. This seminar series is designed to offer an opportunity to do just this: recognising the need to broaden discussions beyond any single academic field; engaging international speakers from all the areas under discussion and ensuring that practitioners are fully engaged with academic researchers. The series is both innovative and timely in addressing these discourses. Whilst the seminar series may not answer all the questions, it will engage in informed discourses that help formulate future research agendas that are international in focus.\n\nSeminar Series therefore aims:\n- To bring together policy makers, academics and practitioners and to explore the dynamics between volunteering, development and tourism in an international context.\n- To draw on a number of research fields and academic disciplines to develop an holistic appreciation of international volunteering in the twenty first century. \n- To engage with practitioners in order to develop best practice and ensure the sustainability of the sector.\n- To open up new research agendas examining under explored areas. \n- To build research capacity by engaging early career researchers and post graduate.\n- To inform future policy developments by bringing together policy-makers and world experts in debate.\n\nThese proposed seminars are already attracting a lot of interest from not-for-profit organisations offering volunteer opportunities, who're indicating their desire to use the series to inform the development of good practice within their organisations and through contributing to the development of a British Standard for Assuring quality in the sector.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/M002802/1","grantId":"ES/M002802/1","fundValue":"29579","fundStart":"2014-10-01","fundEnd":"2016-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Angela M  Benson","coPersons":["KONSTANTINOS  TOMAZOS","Mark Peter Hampton"],"organisation":"University of Brighton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
