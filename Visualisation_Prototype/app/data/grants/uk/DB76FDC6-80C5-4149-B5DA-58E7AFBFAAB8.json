{"id":"DB76FDC6-80C5-4149-B5DA-58E7AFBFAAB8","title":"Performance Ecologies","abstractText":"This project investigates interactions of performance and ecology through the idea of 'performance ecologies': performance processes that travers the natural and cultural worlds as actual ecologies. Its research includes site-specific production at the SS Great Britain (Bristol Dock), Bristol Zoo and the Eden project, Cornwall. These and other contemporary performance experiments are analysed in the perspective of cultural presentations of nature in the 19th-20th centuries to produce ecological accounts of performance generally. How do different types of performance, including theatrical performance, figure as ecologies? What implications do performance ecologies carry for the environment, culture and politics in the twenty-first century?","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=113047/1","grantId":"113047/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2006-03-01","fundEnd":"2006-06-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Baz  Kershaw","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
