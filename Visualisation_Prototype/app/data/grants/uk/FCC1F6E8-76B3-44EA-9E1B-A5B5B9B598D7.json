{"id":"FCC1F6E8-76B3-44EA-9E1B-A5B5B9B598D7","title":"Reducing implicit and explicit bias via decategorization","abstractText":"<p>Social categories define us; female, male, black, white, young, oldâ€¦but they also provide the basis for prejudice and intergroup discrimination. Racism, sexism, ageism: these are all social problems characterised by our tendency to categorise. Rather than trying to ignore categories one recently proposed intervention to reduce intergroup bias is to encourage people to think categorically in a more complex way. This can take the form of increasing the number of categories that participants need to process in forming an impression or by making the nature of the relationship between those categories more complex.</p> \n<p>It is argued that&nbsp;having to consider multiple criteria for social categorization could reduce bias because of extreme structural complexity. If categorization is psychologically useful (Allport, 1954; Turner et al., 1987), beyond some complexity threshold where the number and/or relatedness of category dimensions define complexity, any one category may be abandoned as a way of defining an intergroup encounter. </p> \n<p>The aim of this project is to extend research on this multiple categorization strategy of bias-reduction by focusing on explanatory and mediating processes as well as the impact on implicit forms of intergroup bias.</p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E011861/1","grantId":"ES/E011861/1","fundValue":"74402","fundStart":"2007-06-04","fundEnd":"2009-06-03","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Richard John Crisp","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Kent","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
