{"id":"998C1AAD-4E70-4972-8E38-974C86BDFB48","title":"Predicting the population consequences of environmental change","abstractText":"The environment that most natural populations experience is changing. Not only as a result of global climate change, but also as a consequence of other anthropogenic activities including hunting, habitat modification and the introduction of alien species. Such environmental change has already been demonstrated to impact animal and plant populations and the ecosystems in which these populations are embedded. The speed of environmental change continues to accelerate with potentially catastrophic consequences. Unfortunately biologists do not have a good track record of accurately predicting how environmental change will impact natural populations. This is because populations and the environment they experience are complex. We have identified an approach that is likely to improve upon the predictions that biologists are able to make about how populations will respond to environment change. The types of response we are able to model include both short-term ecological ones and longer-term evolutionary responses. Our approach relies on a powerful, recently developed modelling framework that can be applied to the types of data that biologists often collect. We will apply the approach to construct a detailed model to a well-studied population of Yellowstone wolves. Analysis of this model will allow us to predict how the Yellowstone wolf population may respond to various environmental change scenarios. We will also construct simplified versions of the model for a wide range of animal data sets to identify more general patterns in ways that animal populations are likely to respond to environmental change. Our work has the potential to substantially improve our understanding of how environmental change is likely to impact natural populations in both the short and long term.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/I023791/1","grantId":"NE/I023791/1","fundValue":"344003","fundStart":"2012-02-01","fundEnd":"2012-12-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Tim  Coulson","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
