{"id":"3C760AB6-2A0F-484C-8DE4-9A81F08386B7","title":"Verification and correctness of service-oriented systems","abstractText":"Service-oriented computing (SOC) is the paradigm that underlies the infrastructure on which the Digital Economy is being built. It offers the ability for businesses and organisations to operate on a globalised, platform-independent market of services, and for individuals to interact with businesses and organisations in a flexible and seamless way that responds to individual needs.\n\nThe specific research that we propose to develop addresses fundamental questions raised by SOC on the computational theory and the methods and techniques that are needed to make this infrastructure reliable. Although research has been funded on global ubiquitous computing in general, and Web services in particular, only very little effort has been directed to two of the distinguishing aspects of SOC as a computational paradigm: the asynchronous nature of the interactions that SOC presupposes (the large majority of models that have been proposed are based on synchronous communication, which prevents the kind of loose coupling that is required for open-world software), and the fact that the configurations of the systems that operate on global computers (like the Internet) are intrinsically dynamic, thus defeating the traditional engineering methods that rely on design-time integration of software applications.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K000683/1","grantId":"EP/K000683/1","fundValue":"5360","fundStart":"2013-03-18","fundEnd":"2013-06-17","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Jose Luiz Fiadeiro","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Royal Holloway, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
