{"id":"E4AD0E18-8FA0-4E01-BE0F-DE9BF9861315","title":"Belfast e-Science Centre (BeSC)","abstractText":"The Centre's strategic vision is to enable a dynamic e-infrastructure of resources, tools and applications that is a key enabler for Research, Industry and Commerce. However, today's ecosystem of e-Science solutions are largely based on disparate open source tools that lack integration, are hardware and operating system dependant, are cumbersome to set up, require steep learning curves and are difficult to use.To realise this vision, BeSC aims to build on its success to date and address the above limitations with focused research within three key domains: Digital Media, Financial Services and Bioinformatics. The research will investigate secure, integrated, open and easy to use high level tooling to allow users to manage the lifecycle of their applications and services deployed within a heterogeneous Grid infrastructure. Such a framework would provide UK e-Science community with simple mechanisms to create dynamic, scalable, vendor and architecture neutral IT infrastructures and thus enable the operation of a truly heterogeneous e-infrastructure throughout the UK research community.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F066139/1","grantId":"EP/F066139/1","fundValue":"898535","fundStart":"2008-09-01","fundEnd":"2012-01-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Ron  Perrott","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Queen's University of Belfast","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
