Laboratory-based experiments \nto investigate functional consequences of these genetic variants \nis a costly and time-consuming process. The core application focus of the project \nis to construct algorithmically-based methods for predicting \nthe functional consequence of genetic variants, a problem where we have already \nachieved some state-of-the-art results in certain contexts. 50% of the project period will be \ngiven over to the design of improved algorithms specific to this application.\nThe other 50% of the project period will be given over to achieving \nstate-of-the-art performance with these new methods, and existing methods, \nin application to the stated goal of predicting which variants, insertions \nand deletion events are associated with human disease. The pathways to impact \nis briefly described in the Case and more fully detailed in the Pathways to Impact \nstatement.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M01715X/1","grantId":"EP/M01715X/1","fundValue":"271072","fundStart":"2015-06-01","fundEnd":"2018-05-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Ian Colin Grant  Campbell","coPersons":["Thomas Richard Gaunt"],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
