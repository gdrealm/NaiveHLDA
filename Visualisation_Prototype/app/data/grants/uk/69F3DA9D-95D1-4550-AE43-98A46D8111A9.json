Infertility carries particular stigma among this group; it can alter identities and affect family/social relationships. One of the main aims of the project is to understand the changing meanings of infertility in the context of changing patterns of family and kinship more generally in the UK. A key element of the study is its focus on the new reproductive technologies and the consequences that their increasing availability has for this community.</p> \n<p>In this two phase study, 100 individual birth histories will be collected in order to situate infertility within the full range of fertility experiences among British Pakistanis. Secondly, in-depth interviews and life histories with 30-40 individuals who are seeking or who have recently used fertility treatment will enable detailed exploration of how people negotiate their quest for a child.&nbsp;Within this group careful attention will be paid to discourses of religion and science, understandings of the body, and meanings of marriage, kinship and family life. Interviews will also be conducted with community/religious leaders and health workers.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-23-1488","grantId":"RES-000-23-1488","fundValue":"181245","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Robert  Simpson","coPersons":["Kate  Hampshire","Mwenza Thandiwe  Blell"],"organisation":"Durham University","findingsText":" o Empirical Understanding: the project has contributed to an understanding of how infertility is situated within a wider range of experiences of family formation among Pakistani Muslim families. The research contributed to an understanding of normative family formation as well as the strategies [eg divorce, adoption and fostering] that are deployed to create the appearance of such a family. In particular, the research has provided insights into the take up of assisted reproductive technologies within this community and drawn attention to the ethical issues that are faced in relation to IVF and gamete donation. \no Methods: the ethnographic approach adopted in this research was in itself novel for this field of research and the project broke new ground in two areas 1) team interviewing and the idea of the ethnographic interview and 2) a contribution to the emergent field of anthropological demography. \no Theory: a contribution to understanding of 1) the causes and effects of demographic change within the UK Pakistani Muslim community and 2) the ways in which new reproductive technologies and transactions in embryos and gametes raise questions of identity, exchange, kinship and the meaning altruism in ethnic minority contexts.\no Application: dialogue with clinicians and practitioners working extensively with ethnic minority groups in the UK has resulted in reflection on practice where diversity issues exist. The PI was able to contribute knowledge generated within this project directly into a national working party established to consider the ethics of human tissue donation [Nuffield Council on Bioethics]. the data base [in published and archived form] will enable others to make an future contributions to the emerging picture of how ethnic minorities in the UK manage infertility in the 21st century.
