Most commercial large-scale processes operate with air or oxygen as the oxidant at elevated temperatures. A famous example is ethane oxidation to ethylene oxide using Ag/A12O3 as a catalyst. Because these reactions operate at over 200C a major problem is associated with the loss of the product by sequential oxidation. These are very demanding conditions for catalysts, and often they are unable to perform as efficiently as desired. One strategy to overcome this relies on the design of catalysts capable of operating at lower temperatures in the range 40 - 80C, where the products can be expected to be more stable. Further significant benefits can be expected it the reactions can be done in supercritical fluids, rather than normal liquids. (Supercritical fluids are a special state of matter in between gases and liquids). In particular, the conversion rates are expected to be faster and higher than for normal liquid solvents.Reactions in supercritical fluids, and with the green solvent supercritical C02, are the areas we wish to explore in this proposal.We also aim explore the use of biphasic systems to remove the product from the supercritical media in which the catalyst will be dispersed which may also lead to a decrease in the over-oxidation of products. This approach is highly adventurous and represents a step change in selective oxidation methodology, which is currently undertaken in the gas or liquid phase..","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/C523113/1","grantId":"EP/C523113/1","fundValue":"98746","fundStart":"2006-04-01","fundEnd":"2009-06-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Graham  Hutchings","coPersons":["Stuart Hamilton Taylor","Jonathan Keith Bartley"],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
