The first considers the identification of high ability children attending schools in slums of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Objective one studies the current identification process within 50-60 schools with children in grade six. Teachers will be asked to identify children they believe are high ability providing reasons why. It will be observed whether the current identification process is biased towards any particular gender or cultural norms. All grade six children in the 50-60 schools will be given a battery of standard tests utilised to identify giftedness along with English, mathematics and Kiswahili tests. A comparison will be carried out looking for any correlations between those identified by the schools, parents, peers and communities, and those by the tests. Other questions explored will include children’s self-perception of their own ‘ability’.<br /><br />Objective two considers the creation of an accurate/cost-efficient identification process for teachers and school managers, enabling them to effectively identify high ability children. The third investigates the possibility of enriching and accelerating learning by designing and developing a framework for running a “Saturday Scholar Program”. The final part is the dissemination of the findings to educators, policy makers, governments, opinion formers, and relevant stakeholders.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K011987/1","grantId":"ES/K011987/1","fundValue":"78325","fundStart":"2013-12-31","fundEnd":"2015-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  We are currently 10 months into an 18 month grant.

We are currently half way through this project. What we have found initially is that there is very little support for high ability children in government schools in poor areas. Identification for teachers typically implies children who are able to help facilitate learning and support their own teaching. We are currently devising a 'sieve' method using our current data set of around 1,850 children/families to allow governments, charities and philanthropists to identify high ability children in the first instance 'quickly and effectively'. Further research visits to Tanzania will take the project further. Once we have developed the Sieve along with our ideas for support we hope to trial this with different groups, including governments, philanthropists, NGOs, charities and private chains/school owners, Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Education,Government, Democracy and Justice","dataset":"gtr"}
