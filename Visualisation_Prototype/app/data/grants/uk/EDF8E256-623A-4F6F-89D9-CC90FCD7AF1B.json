{"id":"EDF8E256-623A-4F6F-89D9-CC90FCD7AF1B","title":"Inter-Life: interoperability and transition","abstractText":"The project will investigate the use of Information and Communications Technologies (ICTs) to support skills development by young people to enhance their management of life transitions. It will develop a mobile and three-dimensional (3D) virtual community called ‘Inter-Life’.&nbsp; Educational and social transitions have significant impacts on performance, motivation and identity formation.&nbsp; Inter-Life will offer the opportunity for participants to work together on transition activities in the community, whether they are logged in, or using their mobile device away from the desktop.&nbsp; It will provide reflective and personal development tools and scenarios for transitions, to demonstrate the flexibility and robustness of the educational and technical designs.&nbsp; In particular, the research will focus upon:\n<br />\n<br />\n<ul>\n <li>User engagement, co-design, and development</li>\n <li>Identification of learning outcomes, processes, and skills acquisition</li>\n <li>Participant identity formation and development associated with Inter-Life usage</li>\n <li>Professional development of educators working in 3D communities</li>\n</ul>\n<br />The project will adopt mixed-method, technology-enhanced data gathering and analysis. Phenomenographic techniques will be used - analysing personal accounts of participants across a range of settings. The project will investigate identity development from an Activity Theory perspective, viewing identity as individual and social construct, rather than a fixed quality or 'given'.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F042116/1","grantId":"ES/F042116/1","fundValue":"412047","fundStart":"2008-12-01","fundEnd":"2011-11-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Victor  Lally","coPersons":["Jane  Magill","Stephen  Brindley","Evan  Magill","Mario  Kolberg","Brian  Canavan"],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
