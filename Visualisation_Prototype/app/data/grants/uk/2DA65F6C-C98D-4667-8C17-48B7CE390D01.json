However, as the breadth and complexity of these tasks might suggest, protein molecules are necessarily structurally complex. The sequence of each protein chain is dictated by the gene that encodes it, but until and unless these chains fold up into precise shapes they have no biological activity. The machinery that makes the chain is called the ribosome and the growing chain is extruded in an unstructured state that must then fold and assemble to its biologically active structure after it is released. It is at this point that the cell employs a group of helper proteins, known as molecular chaperones, the function of which is to assist the process of folding and assembly. Molecular chaperones are themselves protein molecules and take different forms depending on their role. Some are small, inert structures that coat unfolded protein chains, while at the other end of the spectrum there are large energy-requiring machines that perform complex tasks. One of the latter classes is termed the chaperonins which are cavern-like, toroidal structures capable of capturing unfolded protein chains and sequestering them in a central cavity. When in this environment the chain can spontaneously fold into a shape dictated only by the sequence of amino acids and driven by the chemical properties of these constituent units. The necessity for the folding process to occur in this capsule arises from the molecular properties of unfolded protein chains. In the folded, biologically active state, the hydrophobic (water-avoiding) amino acids are clustered in the core to minimise contact with water and the structure is compact; indeed it is the burial of these groups that drive folding. In its newly synthesised state, prior to folding, hydrophobic amino acids are exposed; this causes aggregation of protein chains which are inactive. By sequestering individual unfolded chains and allowing them to fold in isolation, this potential aggregation process is avoided and folding is highly efficient. The workings of a device on the tens of nanometre scale that can do these things are intriguing. The machine must be able to bind to the unfolded protein chain, swallow it into a cavity, close the cavity to allow folding in a protected space, re-open and eject the folded protein into the cellular environment where it can perform its biological function. To do this chaperonins require chemical energy in the form of ATP hydrolysis; i.e. they are chemo-mechanical devices capable of turning chemistry into molecular movements. Evolution has produced two designs for these folding machines; the group I chaperonins found in bacteria, chloroplasts and mitochondria and the group II which are found everywhere else, i.e. in the cytoplasm of all eukaryotes and in archaea. The group I version is reasonably well understood at the level of its chemically driven mechanism, but the group II chaperonins are more mysterious and more challenging to study. The focus of the work we propose is a group II chaperonin known as the Thermosome. Although we know the structure of this complex protein, its mechanism is ill-defined and our aim is to elucidate the mechanical states through which this device is driven as it goes through the chemical cycle of ATP hydrolysis. By employing optical methods which report motions within the Thermosome and which are sensitive to molecular docking events, we will determine how the processes of binding a protein substrate, encapsulating it and then releasing it is driven and orchestrated by the chemical events in the ATP sites of this complex molecule. Not only will this contribute to our knowledge of cellular function, but in the long-run an understanding of the workings of biologically evolved molecular devices will be invaluable in the design and synthesis of man-made nano-machines.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F007345/1","grantId":"BB/F007345/1","fundValue":"414455","fundStart":"2008-03-01","fundEnd":"2011-08-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Anthony  Clarke","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
