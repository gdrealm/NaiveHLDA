A study of Odessa, Ukraine","abstractText":"The proposed project aims at developing an innovated theoretical concept: the idea of &quot;post- cosmopolitanism&quot;, and investigating how it might be understood as a description of a cultural-political phenomenon in the city of Odessa, Ukraine. Cosmopolitanism is already well theorised and works well as a model for understanding a quality of life that has characterised Odessa for centuries.\nThe goal of this project is to study ethnographically the implications of diminishing ethnic diversity for practice of urban coexistence and inter-ethnic engagement. Furthermore, we aim to investigate the concept of post-cosmopolitanism in the context of the recent pro-western political shift in Ukraine.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=119435/1","grantId":"119435/1","fundValue":"39824","fundStart":"2006-09-01","fundEnd":"2007-08-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  An international conference was held and an exhibition mounted in Cambridge and Istanbul.
