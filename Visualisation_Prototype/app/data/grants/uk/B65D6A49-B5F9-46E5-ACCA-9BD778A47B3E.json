Using our work on the 2001 Census as an exemplar, we have worked with them at senior levels to influence how they will produce, manage and disseminate aggregate data from the 2011 Census. This, in turn, has fed into continued collaboration and activity co-funded with the ESRC through the CAIRD3 project (October 2011 to September 2012).\n\nOur partnership with ONS has also had an impact on the other UK census agencies' approaches to disseminating the 2011 Census, through improvements in describing the data in both table frameworks and classifications, leading to greater harmonisation between the agencies' outputs.\n\nONS has doubled their financial contribution to the follow-on CAIRD3 project compared to its contribution to CAIRD2, indicating the high regard in which this work and its impact on their thinking around data organisation and dissemination issues is held.\n\nThe variable-based rather than table-based approach to organising and accessing Census is also supporting broader census data users by simplifying access to it. This is reflected by the comments of Keith Dugmore of consultancy Demographic Decisions: &quot;It's vital to help users of the Census to express their needs in simple terms (&quot;I want to see the population classified by Age, Ethnicity, &amp;amp;amp;amp; Education.....&quot;) and so swiftly find what they want, without specialist knowledge: the Infuse project has already made great progress towards removing barriers to access.&quot; Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Agriculture, Food and Drink,Chemicals,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Construction,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Electronics,Energy,Environment,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Healthcare,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Government, Democracy and Justice,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Pharmaceu Cultural,Societal,Economic,Policy & public services","person":"Justin  Hayes","coPersons":["Jackie  Carter"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":" CAIRD2 developed new approaches for access to Census aggregate data, moving from the traditional tables-based view to a multi-dimensional dataset. This is a significant advance in approaches to organising and accessing large and complex datasets, such as the UK Census aggregate outputs.\n\nThis facilitated our creation of a new web interface - InFuse - to access the data, where researchers are able to select which variables they are interested in finding data for, without any prior knowledge of the hundreds of aggregate tables published by the UK Census agencies. InFuse has been available as an online service to UK academics since its launch on 6 May 2011. A major impact of CAIRD2 has been our relationship with the Office for National Statistics.
