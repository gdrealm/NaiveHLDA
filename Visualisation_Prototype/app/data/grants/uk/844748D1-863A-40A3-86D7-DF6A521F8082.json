For this new therapeutic strategy, it is indispensable to provide cells with a local environment (niche) that enhances and regulates their proliferation and differentiation. In this regard, biomaterial technology currently leads the way in trying to fulfil these requirements by recreating artificial three-dimensional environments. However, understanding how, why and in what environment these cells differentiate in a lineage-specific manner are essential for tissue engineering and stem cell therapy. We believe that this underlying biology (i.e. specific signals or stimuli which make the cells respond) has not yet been properly investigated and that this is likely to undermine current attempts to recreate the stem cell niche using biomaterials. Therefore, we plan to understand the role substrate stiffness plays in maintaining the corneal stem cell niche (the home for cells required to cover the surface of the cornea). Our expertise in ocular surface models means we are well placed to investigate the changes in gene and protein expression associated with substrate stiffness dependent (mechanosensitive) differentiation. Together these investigations will feed directly into the field of tissue engineering and our own on-going MRC, BBSRC and EPSRC research into ocular surface biomaterials and corneal stem cell transplantation. \nAcoustically induced inelastic light scattering (Brillouin microscopy) allows non-contact, direct readout of the mechanical properties of a material and has been used successfully to measure, at microscopic resolution, the biomechanical properties of the cornea and lens of the human eye. We plan to employ this sophisticated method to measure stiffness across the surface of normal and disease/wounded corneas producing high resolution maps of the tissues' mechanical properties. We will then seek to affect localised stiffness using an enzyme (collagenase) to break up the corneas main structural protein (collagen) in a highly controlled manner. The enzyme will be delivered by a gel that sticks to the cornea to allow precise positioning of the enzyme and a corresponding localised effect on stiffness. We have shown previously that corneal stem cells differentiate when grown on stiff collagen gels and that collagenase can reduce this stiffness with a proportional reduction in differentiated cells. Therefore we plan to investigate a new pre-corneal stem cell transplantation technique. In short, having validated that the corneal stem cell niche is sensitive to changes in its stiffness we will develop a method to control its stiffness prior to corneal stem cell transplantation with the belief that this will result in an improved residency time for the transplanted cells in an undifferentiated form. The predicted outcome being a significantly improved success rate for corneal stem cell transplantation. Recently the overall clinical success rate of corneal stem cell transplantation has remained static at approx. 75% with half of those able to discern two lines or more of symbols on an eye chart. Whilst this represents a remarkable surgical achievement there remains considerable room for improvement. We believe restoring the corneal tissues mechanical properties prior to stem cell transplantation represents a significant surgical enhancement.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/K017217/2","grantId":"MR/K017217/2","fundValue":"447790","fundStart":"2014-09-01","fundEnd":"2016-11-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Che John Connon","coPersons":["Carl  Paterson"],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
