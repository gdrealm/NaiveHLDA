The key petrophysical properties that determine how fractures initiate and grow are determined on the scale of flaws in the rock. Laboratory measurements of these properties are essential to successful modelling studies of hydraulic fracture, and hence optimisation of production. In this research a range of innovative technologies will be used including, for the first time, 3D observation and quantification of hydrofracture growth with time inside the rock by means of synchrotron X-ray tomography coupled with location of crack growth events using acoustic emissions. This will show how hydrofractures initiate and develop, the role of pre-existing flaws in their initiation, the amount of fluid pressure required to initiate them, and how their form might be modified to optimize gas production. \n Interpretation of the results depends on parallel measurements of the strength, friction and resistance to fracture, and also permeability to fluids, because rock strength depends on the extent to which fluids can penetrate their pores. These properties are also affected by the mineralogy, organic content and microstructure of the shale. Therefore we will test several shales with different such characteristics. These properties also determine, in ways yet to be understood, the stability of boreholes. Permeability of shales to gas and liquids is also known to depend on value of the fluid pressure in the pores for a given depth of burial, thus it changes as gas pressure is drawn down by production. Knowledge of this pressure sensitivity is essential for the successful interpretation of well tests, from which gas in place and likely reservoir yield must be estimated. Thus this research will produce results that can impact on a range of aspects of shale gas exploitation.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/M001458/1","grantId":"NE/M001458/1","fundValue":"582119","fundStart":"2014-11-30","fundEnd":"2017-11-29","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Julian  Mecklenburgh","coPersons":["Ernest  Rutter","Peter David Lee","Kevin George Taylor"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
