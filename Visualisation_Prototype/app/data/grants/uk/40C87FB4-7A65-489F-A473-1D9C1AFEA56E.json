{"id":"40C87FB4-7A65-489F-A473-1D9C1AFEA56E","title":"Aerogels in Fibre-Optics","abstractText":"The proposed project is about using silica aerogels in the field of fibre optics. Aerogel is a highly porous form of glass with remarkable optical properties, but has barely been exploited in fibre optics. It is made of the same material as optical fibres, namely silica glass. However, whereas the glass in the fibre is solid, an aerogel is like a sponge: an open porous network of solid matter with air in between. Indeed, most of the volume of an aerogel is air, making it very lightweight. The glass network and the pores are structured on a scale of tens of nanometres or less, much smaller than the wavelength of light. The aerogel is therefore an example of a metamaterial: light sees the aerogel as an averaged-out medium that is mainly air, yet the glass network makes it rigid like a solid. The refractive index of aerogel can be as low as 1.01: almost the same as air and very different from solid glass. Indeed, the lowest index of any common solid or liquid is around 1.27, so aerogel is really the only way to get lower-index materials. Although light and friable, aerogel is quite robust if not abused: it looks like frozen smoke and handles like Oasis floral foam. It has found diverse applications, from thermal insulation to the collection of interplanetary dust.Despite the intriguing properties of this material, few people have tried to use it in fibre optics. We now have a unique opportunity to bring these two technologies together, having recently demonstrated the necessary methods using tools we have developed for supercritical drying and fibre fabrication. The aim will be to optimise the material, allow it to interact with the light in a fibre, and so enable an entirely new class of photonic components that exploit the optical properties of aerogel in a fibre-compatible way. Key applications include high-numerical-aperture waveguides, compact splitters and couplers, fibre-coupled nonlinear sources and new plasmonic devices.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F018622/1","grantId":"EP/F018622/1","fundValue":"552180","fundStart":"2008-02-13","fundEnd":"2012-02-12","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Our project has had academic impacts among several collaborators inside and outside our institution:\n\nWolverson (Bath Physics) Raman spectroscopy of Si nanoparticles in aerogel, 1 publication + 1 in preparation\n\nColeman (Bath Physics) positron spectroscopy of aerogel, 1 publication\n\nMattia (Bath Chemical Engineering) carbon film deposition in aerogel\n\nPererra (Bath Chemical Engineering) toxic gas sensing with MOF-doped aerogel\n\nDowson (Brunel and Buro-Happold Ltd) energy economy of aerogel build Cultural,Societal Cultural,Societal","person":"Tim  Birks","coPersons":["Paul Alistair Snow","Stefan Alexander Maier","William J Wadsworth","Richard  England"],"organisation":"University of Bath","findingsText":" Aerogel is a highly porous form of silica glass. Whereas glass is normally a solid dense material, an aerogel is like a microscopic sponge: an open porous network of solid matter with air in between. Indeed, most of the volume of an aerogel is air, making it very lightweight. It has found diverse applications, from thermal insulation to the collection of interplanetary dust.\n\n\n\nOur project was about using silica aerogel in fibre optics and other optical technologies. The glass network is on a much smaller scale than the wavelength of light, making the aerogel a type of metamaterial: light sees the aerogel as a kind of &quot;average&quot; material that's mostly air, yet it is rigid like a solid. This gives it remarkable optical properties.\n\n\n\nWe started by discovering how to make highly transparent aerogel with flat surfaces, to be a good optical material, and we developed new techniques to do this routinely. Then we demonstrated two ways to incorporate it into optical fibres.\n\n\n\nIn the first approach, we narrowed fibres by heating them near the melting point and stretching them. This brings the light in the fibre to the surface, where it can interact with aerogel that we form in situ using our new techniques. The aerogel is like &quot;solid air&quot;: it has a similarly low refractive index so that the fibre behaves optically as if still suspended in air, but the aerogel protects it from being degraded by contamination or handling. Examples of fibre components protected like this include fused couplers (fibre-optic beam-splitters found in fibre telecommunication systems), tapered supercontinuum generators (producing intense white light with uses in spectroscopy, time and frequency standards and bio-medical imaging and analysis), gas sensors (exploiting how gases diffuse through the aerogel) and photonic nanowires (to make tiny fibre circuits).\n\n\n\nIn the second approach, we took a fibre with a hollow core and holes in the cladding and filled it with aerogel, and showed that it acts as a waveguide. This is a remarkable result: no solid has a low enough refractive index to be a cladding for an aerogel core, but our holey air-glass cladding behaves as if it has an even lower index. The fibre allowed interactions of high intensity lasers with the aerogel over relatively long distances.\n\n\n\nFinally, we modified aerogel to give it new optical properties. Gold nanoparticles gave the aerogel plasmonic properties, exploiting the highly intense electric fields around small metal particles. Adding ytterbium allowed us to form dense doped glass with applications in lasers and optical amplifiers. Other dopants include silicon nanoparticles, quantum dots, nano-diamonds, metal-organic framework nanoparticles and carbon thin films, and we collaborated with other researchers studying how their optical materials behaved when held fixed in a low index rigid material.\n\n\n\nIn summary, we proved the potential of silica aerogels in fibre optics. We optimised the material itself, incorporated it within fibres in two complementary ways, and enabled new types of fibre-compatible photonic components. We also facilitated our collaborators studies in their own fields of research. 1. Stable, high-temperature packaging of photonic components that require surrounding air as a part of the optical structure. Examples include fused couplers, tapered fibre supercontinuum generators, gas sensors, evanescent input and output couplers for integrated optics, nanofibre circuits and evanescent gas sensors.\n\n\n\n2. Long-distance high-intensity interactions between light and dopants in aerogel, for example in nonlinear optical devices.\n\n\n\n3. Porous rigid substrates for particle-based sensors. Examples include metal-organic framework nanoparticles, gold nanoparticles, quantum dots and silicon nanoparticles.\n\n\n\n4. Optical amplifiers and lasers based on rare-earth doped silica made using aerogel or xerogel techniques.\n\n\n\n5. In collaboration with Brunel University we showed that, even with the small-scale unoptimised processes we use to make aerogels, the energy and CO2 burden of manufacture is offset by savings within two years for use as a retrofitted thermal insulator in buildings. 1.
