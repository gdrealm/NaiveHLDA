The aims of the UK-China Particle Technology Forum are to enhance communications between scientists and engineers from both academic institutions and industrial companies of the two countries, to establish a platform to foster new and substantial collaborations, and to identify and address common challenges in the area of particle technology.The UK-China Particle Technology Forum is timely and aligns very well with the government strategies to establishing a partnership in various areas including education, energy, environment, aerospace, e-science and drug development, where particle technology plays key roles.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E065163/1","grantId":"EP/E065163/1","fundValue":"6842","fundStart":"2007-04-02","fundEnd":"2007-07-01","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Yulong  Ding","coPersons":["Richard  Wakeman","Jonathan Peter Seville","Ugur  Tuzun","Raffaella  Ocone","Stefaan Jan Rogier Simons","Michael John Hounslow"],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
