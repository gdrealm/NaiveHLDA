{"id":"D7FF6EE5-5761-47D7-818C-EDBC5D323504","title":"Can Values Reduce Prejudice Even when Identification is High?","abstractText":"Since the London Bombings in 2005, Britain has seen a steep rise in prejudice against Muslims. Many Muslims suffer the consequences of such prejudice, hence it is important to find ways to reduce it. A well-known finding is that identification with the group to which one belongs (ingroup) leads to greater prejudice against other groups (outgroups) that are perceived as threatening to the ingroup. Yet, identification also has positive aspects. People who identify highly with their country tend to be more committed to it and to engage in citizenship behaviours. Hence, reducing identification completely may not be desirable. The research will examine whether thinking about the importance of tolerance values leads to reduced prejudice against Muslims while maintaining high national identification. A survey will examine the complex relations of prejudice against Muslims to values and to national identification. In two additional experiments, participants will be asked to think about the importance of tolerance values. Finding that values can reduce prejudice against Muslims would advocate developing education programmes and mass media campaigns that would aim to reduce prejudice by thinking about concrete situations in which values such as tolerance are important, thereby helping to reduce prejudice against Muslims. \n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F034555/1","grantId":"ES/F034555/1","fundValue":"82056","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Anat  Bardi","coPersons":["Garcia Tendayi Viki"],"organisation":"Royal Holloway, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
