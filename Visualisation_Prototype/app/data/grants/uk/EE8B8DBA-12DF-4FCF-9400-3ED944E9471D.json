In particular it will seek to identify the things we can do both as creators of research and users of research to help to make sure that when we have identified a good solution we can put it into practice more quickly. It will also try to identify how when something is working well we can recognise it and let other people know about it as soon as possible so they can try it too.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0601172","grantId":"G0601172","fundValue":"193384","fundStart":"2007-07-31","fundEnd":"2010-05-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Allan  House","coPersons":["Susan  Hamer"],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
