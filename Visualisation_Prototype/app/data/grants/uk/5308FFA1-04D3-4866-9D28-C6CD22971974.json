{"id":"5308FFA1-04D3-4866-9D28-C6CD22971974","title":"Control of peripheral circadian rhythms (full)","abstractText":"We are investigating how circadian clocks (biological clocks with a period of about 24 hours), control daily cycles of physiology in mice. The bodyâ€™s master circadian clock is located in a small group of cells in the hypothalamus of the brain (the suprachiasmatic nuclei or SCN) and is synchronised to the 24 hour day by daily cycles of light and darkness. However, other organs such as heart and liver also contain circadian clocks, which exert local control over daily rhythms of physiology and metabolism. Many of these peripheral clocks are thought to be controlled by the timing of food intake. We are establishing the roles of circadian clocks in the SCN and in peripheral organs in the regulation of blood pressure, heart rate, energy metabolism and hormone secretion. It is thought that the activity of peripheral circadian clocks may underlie profound daily variations in the severity of many common human diseases such as arthritis, asthma and cardiovascular disease. The work may lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying circadian variations in human diseases, may identify new approaches to reduce such risks and may suggest improvements to conventional treatments in which the timing of drug use is matched to the circadian rhythm of the illness.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G9719726","grantId":"G9719726","fundValue":"1602980","fundStart":"1999-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Anthony  Harmar","coPersons":["Jonathan  Seckl","Megan  Holmes"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
