Consultation proved difficult owing to the lack of up-to-date information on such groups, legacy issues and their transient nature. \n \nHowever, the results triangulated well; groups were using ICTs, including social networking to communicate. But, significant barriers to the use of ICTs were found, including\nan 'over-reliance' on group 'experts'\nsteep learning curves\ninadequate levels of technological support\n lack of technological literacy and uptake of technology by group members\n\nFor influencers (such as policy makers), technology mediated communications were considered in a similar way to other correspondence and were seen as broadening community engagement. But, without the support of a chief executive and a stronger evidence base for the quality of such information, the influencers were left to follow the latest trends in ICT developments. Other problems included a lack of overall literacy of the population, both in terms of ICT and language.\n\nThe outputs include a fact sheet, a set of on-line resources for groups, and project documents, all available on the project website: http://dtcc.yolasite.com/","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/I507744/1","grantId":"AH/I507744/1","fundValue":"32044","fundStart":"2011-01-01","fundEnd":"2011-06-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Andree  Woodcock","coPersons":["Maged Kamel  Boulos","Jon  Whittle","Derek  McAuley"],"organisation":"Coventry University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
