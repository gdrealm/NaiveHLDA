Stem cells, called satellite cells, within skeletal muscle do repair and regenerate lost fibres, but as the new fibres remain dystrophin-deficient, they continually break down, eventually leading to loss of muscle fibres and replacement by fat and connective tissue. If we want to use stem cells to treat DMD, these would have to be a type of stem cell that can be delivered via the blood system, as DMD affects all the muscles of the body. We propose to use stem cells derived from the patient themselves, so that they would not promote immunonological rejection. We aim to engineer these stem cells so that they have a heritable copy of the dystrophin gene. But the whole dystrophin gene is too large to fit into any viral vector. We will therefore engineer the dystrophin gene to be small enough to fit into a lentiviral vector, but large enough to contain as much as possible of the gene, to make it as functional as possible. Combining the best stem cell to regenerate skeletal muscle with the optimal dystrophin gene will pave the way for clinical trials to treat DMD.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0900872","grantId":"G0900872","fundValue":"1215170","fundStart":"2010-06-01","fundEnd":"2014-05-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Jennifer E Morgan","coPersons":["HKM  Lochmuller","Francesco  Muntoni","Adrian James Thrasher","Olivier  Danos"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
