{"id":"901BA0FC-2050-4C88-9A6F-BB08E9510EBF","title":"Computer Simulation of Ultrasound Guided Procedures","abstractText":"This project aims to develop and evaluate a computer based system for the simulation of ultrasound guided needle insertion procedures in interventional radiology. In such procedures a needle is inserted into a human patient through the skin in order to take a sample (biopsy), drain fluid, or insert various items for the treatment of disorders. The radiologist views the progress of the needle using ultrasound imagery. The current system of training is based around an apprenticeship model (known in clinical circles as see one, do one, teach one ). There is concern over this model with increasing numbers of trainees. The proposed system (a development of an existing, simple, simulator) would simulate these procedures using a mannequin and computer generated ultrasound images, based on real scanned patient data. This has the potential to increase the proficiency of trainees in the early stages of training (and reduce risk to patients). Developments of the current system include; i) Introducing realism in the ultrasound images (such that they are like the real images produced by an ultrasound machine), ii) Modelling the deformation within the body due to the needle, and generating realistic forces on the needle, and iii) Generating varied anatomies and abnormalities for practice. It is essential that the skills acquired from such a system translate to the actual operation. Hence, an evaluation of skill acquisition will be designed and carried out.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D000289/1","grantId":"EP/D000289/1","fundValue":"125076","fundStart":"2006-01-19","fundEnd":"2008-03-18","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Derek  Magee","coPersons":["David  Kessel"],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
