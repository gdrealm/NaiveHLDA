{"id":"27BA41AA-CDFE-4B1D-847A-E7D9156A543D","title":"Activation of the heat shock response by sulfhydryl-reactive chemoprotective agents","abstractText":"Context: Disturbances in the protein homeostasis are major contributors to the complex biological processes that accompany ageing and age-associated pathologies, and also occur during conditions of stress. To protect the proteome, eukaryotic organisms have evolved highly efficient mechanisms. Most prominent are the heat shock response and the phase 2 response that are controlled by transcription factors heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) and nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), respectively. There is a growing interest in the discovery and development of small molecule-inducers of these systems for prevention and treatment of chronic degenerative conditions associated with ageing. Induction of the heat shock response and the phase 2 response leads to upregulation of large networks of cytoprotective proteins that detect and counteract the potentially deleterious consequences of thermal, oxidative and electrophilic stress, and promote survival. Furthermore, both pathways are involved in multiple interactions that link homeostatic metabolism with stress biology, and ultimately play crucial roles in determining health and life span. \n\nSmall molecule activators of Nrf2 have a common chemical signature, that of sulfhydryl reactivity. Emerging evidence suggests that sulfhydryl-reactive molecules also activate the heat shock response. Curiously, anti-inflammatory activity is a consistent property of Nrf2 inducers, indicating that suppression of inflammation is a central aspect of their chemoprotective actions. However, this property is only partially Nrf2-dependent. Interestingly, HSF1 activation has anti-inflammatory effects and is required for protection during inflammatory responses. \n\nAims and Objectives: We hypothesize that the cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory activities of sulfhydryl-reactive chemoprotective agents are mediated through activation of two distinct transcription factors, i.e., Nrf2 and HSF1, through a common chemical signal, that of sulfhydryl reactivity. The specific aims of the proposed study are:\n\n1. To establish which classes of sulfhydryl-reactive chemoprotective agents upregulate HSF1-mediated gene expression.\n2. To elucidate the importance of sulfhydryl reactivity in the activation of transcription factor HSF1.\n3. To define the relative roles of transcription factors HSF1 and Nrf2 in protection against pro-inflammatory stimuli.\n\nPotential applications and benefits: The burden of chronic degenerative conditions on our society is expected to continue to increase, largely due to ageing of the population. Whereas no satisfactory solutions are yet available, it is timely to think about implementing prevention measures that harness the intrinsic cytoprotective mechanisms of the cell. Exploiting the ability of small molecules, many of which are present in the human diet and therefore of presumed low toxicity, to upregulate intracellular defenses, is an exciting area for future development. If, as hypothesized, redox regulation and transcription factor cysteine modifications are central to both the phase 2 response and heat shock response, the development of such &quot;dual&quot; activators will be ideal for simultaneously manipulating these pathways and achieving synergistic protective effects.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/J007498/1","grantId":"BB/J007498/1","fundValue":"320715","fundStart":"2012-04-01","fundEnd":"2015-09-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  This is an ongoing project, but our published work is already being cited and used by other investigators to advance their research.

Furthermore, we found that many of them do so by inhibiting Hsp90, the major negative regulator of transcription factor Hsf1. Mechanistically, one of these inducers was shown to react with cysteine residues in Hsp90. Cysteine reactivity is a common property of these inducers, and it is likely that they operate via this mechanism. These new chemicals entities can be further developed as Hsp90 inhibitors which are mechanistically distinct to those that are currently available or undergoing clinical trials in cancer patients.
