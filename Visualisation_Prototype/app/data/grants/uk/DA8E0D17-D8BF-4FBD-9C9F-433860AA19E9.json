{"id":"DA8E0D17-D8BF-4FBD-9C9F-433860AA19E9","title":"Helioseismic Metrology of the Solar Dynamo","abstractText":"Accurate determinations of the seismic profile and differential rotation in the solar tachocline, and how these quantities vary with time, provide important observational constraints on theoretical models for solar convection and the solar dynamo that drives the Sun's magnetic field. A better understanding of the solar dynamo will lead to an improved understanding of solar variability and its effects on the biosphere.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=PP/E001459/1","grantId":"PP/E001459/1","fundValue":"135404","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"S  Vorontsov","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Queen Mary, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
