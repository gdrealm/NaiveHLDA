The project aims to provide a direct contribution to the global safety assessment of nanomaterials described by the OECD Working Party on Manufactured Nanomaterials (WPMN). The LINK project will develop essential and seminal test methods and data on two agreed nanomaterials that are of particular commercial relevance to the UK. The project will innovate the scientific foundations for adapting or creating test methods that enable the ecotoxicological hazard assessment of nanomaterials. Both particles (i.e. CeO2 and ZnO) are part of a list of 14 nanomaterials, identified as commercially relevant to the global economic impact of nanotechnology. Furthermore, the development of methods to characterize CeO2 and ZnO nanomaterials in concert with parallel and coordinated development for other nanomaterials across the OECD testing program will enablethe future establishment of QSARs (Quantitative Structure Activity Relationships) for predictive safety evaluations of novel nanomaterials.The resulting scientific advancement will help to secure an economic future for the commercialisation of nanotechnologies in and by the UK and provide crucial UK leadership and information to the OECD's global programme on nanomaterials safety assessment.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G043256/1","grantId":"EP/G043256/1","fundValue":"198859","fundStart":"2009-01-12","fundEnd":"2012-07-11","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Findings provide an improved understanding of nanoparticle behavior in the environment.

The UK contribution was to develop test methods and provide data on two agreed nanomaterials that are of particular\n\ncommercial relevance to the UK - ZnO and CeO2 nanoparticles.\n\n\n\nOur particular contribution was the identification and development of new isotopic methods for tracing ZnO and CeO2 nanoparticles in complex natural samples. The methods that have been developed for isotopic tracing ZnO and CeO2 nanoparticle are in the pubic domain to encourage their use for ecotoxicolligical studies of nanomaterials, which are carried out in both academia and industry. A comprehensive evaluation of isotopic techniques for the tracing of ZnO and CeO2 nanoparticles in complex natural samples was carried out. These evaluations led to the development of preferred isotopic tracing methods that involve the use of isotopically labelled ZnO and CeO2 nanoparticles.\n\n\n\nThese recommendations were published in two PROSPCET Reports for the OECD\n\nWorking Party on Manufactured Nanomaterials. Amended versions of thes reports have been (ZnO) or will be (CeO2) be published in the scientific literature.
