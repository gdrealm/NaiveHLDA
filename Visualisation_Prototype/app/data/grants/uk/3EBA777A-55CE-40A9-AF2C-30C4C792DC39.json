{"id":"3EBA777A-55CE-40A9-AF2C-30C4C792DC39","title":"Diaspora Mobilisation and International Security","abstractText":"<p>This project examines when and why political entrepreneurs engage in the transnational political mobilisation of diaspora populations, and how this impacts on the international security environment. The project utilises a comparative and historical case study approach, analysing cases of diaspora mobilisation which have produced significant security impacts. The overall aim of the project is to provide a theoretical framework that can be used to compare processes of diaspora mobilization across different historical and geopolitical contexts. Among other factors, the project aims to better understand the relationship between the geopolitical context in which mobilisation takes place, and the choice of ideology and mobilisation strategy by political entrepreneurs.</p>\n\n<p>The outputs of the project will include a research monograph and scholarly articles. The grant also provides funding for two international workshops â€“ one academic workshop will bring together state of the art research by scholars working at the intersection of migration studies and security studies, and one policy-oriented workshop will bring together academics, government officials and members of diaspora communities to discuss government responses to contemporary patterns of diaspora mobilisation.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-181-25-0036","grantId":"RES-181-25-0036","fundValue":"169785","fundStart":"2007-09-01","fundEnd":"2009-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  Findings have been disseminated via publications Security and Diplomacy Policy & public services","person":"Fiona  Adamson","coPersons":[],"organisation":"School of Oriental & African Studies","findingsText":" Key findings of the project were the following:\n- studying past examples of diaspora politics contextualizes current debates about citizenship, membership and belonging. Many of the current debates about social cohesion are not new, but have historical antecedents. It is important not to treat current debates about social cohesion as sui generis\n- the project drew attention to the importance of the politics of language, narratives and framing in addressing issues of diaspora politics and social cohesion\n- the project shed light on the different policy approaches that are being taken by the UK, US, Germany and France with regards to social cohesion\n- the project pointed to the importance of examining both formal and informal forms of political membership and how they foster or undermine a sense of national belonging The findings on language and formal and informal membership could be built upon further by policymakers and others Security and Diplomacy","dataset":"gtr"}
