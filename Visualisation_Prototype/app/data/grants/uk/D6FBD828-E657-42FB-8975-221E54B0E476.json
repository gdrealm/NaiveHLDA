It is an intermediate heat process and shelf-life that can be used for the safe production of cooked chilled foods. However, the SUSSLE Process/shelf-life cannot presently be used in the production of all cooked chilled foods. The project aims to combine details from industry of processing energy/efficiency, environmental impact, waste reduction etc with robust new scientific data to resolve this practical issue faced by manfacturers thermally processing cooked chilled foods with intermediate shelf lives, and aims to extend the range of foods for which the SUSSLE Process/shelf-life can be applied. The findings will be exploited by food manufacturers in the continued safe production of a greater range of cooked chilled foods.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/K021117/1","grantId":"BB/K021117/1","fundValue":"230565","fundStart":"2013-07-01","fundEnd":"2015-12-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael William  Peck","coPersons":["Jozsef  Baranyi","Gary  Barker"],"organisation":"Institute of Food Research","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
