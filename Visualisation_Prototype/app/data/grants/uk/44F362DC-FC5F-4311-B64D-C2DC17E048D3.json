{"id":"44F362DC-FC5F-4311-B64D-C2DC17E048D3","title":"Somites and patterning of the vertebral column","abstractText":"Malformations of the vertebral skeleton are very common in humans. As many as 10% of adolescent females may be affected by scoliosis, in addition to which there are many other musculo-skeletal problems of varying severity. We know very little about the causes of these anomalies, except that they are all due to some problem that happens during development of the cells that produce the vertebrae in the embryo. These cells are arranged into blocks, called somites. Deviations of the spine appear to be due to a local defect in somite size, for example affecting a somite on the left and not on the right. This project investigates the mechanisms that determine somite size and the rate at which they form. It also explores the relationship between the initial pattern of somites and the mature vertebrae that form from them. The results obtained will be very important for designing new diagnostics potential therapies.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0700095","grantId":"G0700095","fundValue":"473232","fundStart":"2007-11-26","fundEnd":"2011-05-25","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Claudio D Stern","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
