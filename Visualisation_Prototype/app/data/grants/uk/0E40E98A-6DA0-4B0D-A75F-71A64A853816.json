Joint proposal with Astrium UK","abstractText":"The top-level aims of the research proposed in this Case for Support are the following: o Achieve intellectual leadership for the UK in the key work packages related to payload processing and data handling systems in future PPARC-supported ESA science missions. o Secure UK industrial return in the corresponding construction phase contracts. o Promote interests of potential UK principal investigators and add to mission scientific return. o Mutual knowledge transfer (industrial to academic and academic to industrial); combining areas of expertise of academia and industry to promote these UK scientific and industrial interests. This proposal is designed to exploit a trend in the area of on-board payload processing and data handling noted by the consortium members and which requires the co-operation of academic instrument providers and industry. This trend is towards highly-integrated payload processing architectures and, specifically, centralized architectures. A consortium comprising EADS Astrium Ltd., Mullard Space Science Laboratory and Imperial College has been formed to allow the UK to use this trend, and the member's different areas of expertise, in capturing the aims above.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=PP/E006884/1","grantId":"PP/E006884/1","fundValue":"44410","fundStart":"2007-11-01","fundEnd":"2009-01-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Richard Ernest Cole","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
