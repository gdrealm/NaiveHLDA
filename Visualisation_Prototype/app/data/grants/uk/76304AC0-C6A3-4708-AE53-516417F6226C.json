This disruptive technology has the potential to impact upon a number of large, growing markets. Our technology offers easy-to-use, multiplexed electronic detection of biomarkers and has the potential to be used in hundreds, if not thousands, of diagnostic applications in multiple sectors including healthcare, veterinary, drug development, security and agrotech.

High-sensitivity, reproducible detection of clinically relevant protein biomarkers was demonstrated in full serum through an electrochemical impedance phase-change upon antibody(mimetic)-biomarker binding. The University's venture capital partner IP Group is currently appraising the technology for a university spin-out.
