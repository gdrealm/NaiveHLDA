A substantive methodological synergy","abstractText":"<p>Self-concept refers to how people feel about themselves. In self-concept research there is ongoing debate about the relative importance of self-concept in specific areas (eg, physical, social, academic) and global self-concept (or self-esteem), and how they are related. </p>\n\n<p>Substantively, we ask how the effects of specific components of self (eg, physical, social, academic) effect global self-esteem depend on two framing factors. </p>\n\n<p>1. Actual-Ideal Discrepancy. If ideal standards are too high, even good accomplishments can result in low self-esteem. </p>\n\n<p>2. Importance. The more important is a specific component of self-concept, the more impact it has on self-esteem.</p>\n\n<p>Despite the intuitive appeal of these two theoretical predictions and much research, there is little support for either. We propose to address this gap between theory and research with new latent-variable models based on multiple indicators (items) that control for measurement error; a methodological-substantive synergy. </p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Study 1 focuses on actual-ideal discrepancy in relation to physical components of self-concept (appearance, physical ability, physical self-concept) and global self-esteem. Study 2 focuses on actual-ideal discrepancy and importance of self components in relation to various specific (math and verbal, appearance and physical ability self-concepts), domain (academic, physical, spiritual self-concepts) and global (self-esteem) levels of self-concept. <br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2960","grantId":"RES-000-22-2960","fundValue":"83846","fundStart":"2008-10-15","fundEnd":"2010-05-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Herb  Marsh","coPersons":["Laura Francesca Scalas"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
