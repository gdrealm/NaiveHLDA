During transcription of genes into pre-messengerRNA, introns are spliced out and the protein coding pieces, called exons, are joined into messengerRNA (mRNA) that encodes a continuous sequence of the entire protein when translated in the cytoplasm. During the maturation of the mRNA, some exons are variably included in a process called alternative splicing and generate proteins from the same gene that vary in their sequence. Sequencing of the human genome revealed that alternative splicing is abundant and found in at least 60 % of genes. Alternative splicing is most prevalent in the brain and generates enormous molecular diversity. Due to the complexity of the human brain, alternative splicing has been implicated in providing an essential contribution in wireing neurons during development. Neuronal connections in the human brain are not static and can be remodeled when sensory information is processed. Learning and formation of memories further involve changes in the chemical communication between neurons at their contact sites called synapses and also involve remodeling of synapses. To understand how alternative splicing regulation contributes to neuronal connectivity and remodeling of synaptic contacts we use Drosophila as a genetic model system, allowing us to alter gene function in neurons of a developing and performing organism. In particular, we have focused on studying the function of the ELAV, a Drosophila homologue of human Hu proteins and founding member of a family of RNA binding proteins. Although, the essential gene elav is expressed in all neurons, elav mutants have specific defects in axon guidance of midline crossing neurons, in synaptic growth and in photoreceptor neuron development. Consistent the distinct phenotypes of elav mutants, we have found that ELAV is a gene-specific regulator of alternative splicing. Based on the organization of functionally connected prokaryotic genes into transcription units, so called operons, and co-regulated expression of functionally connected genes in the simple eukaryote yeast, it has been proposed that similar principles apply to the regulation of alternative splicing. To test the hypothesis, that co-regulated alternatively spliced genes are functionally connected and to understand the function of ELAV in neurons we will first determine the targets of ELAV. RNA targets bound to ELAV will be purified, amplified and hybridized to Drosophila tiling microarrays, representing the entire Drosophila genome on a single slide as millions of spots of unique sequences. The second step is then to establish functional connections by grouping ELAV target genes according to co-expression at the same developmental stage, annotated gene functions, regulation by the same mechanism and sharing targets with other ELAV family members. In the third step, functions will then be assigned to sets of co-regulated genes through phenotypes of mutants that specifically lack those protein isoforms that are made in the presence of ELAV. The analysis of ELAV regulated genes at genome wide dimensions will yield fundamental insights into functional connections among genes that are involved in brain functions essential to provide quality to life such as learning and memory.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F000855/1","grantId":"BB/F000855/1","fundValue":"466807","fundStart":"2008-01-01","fundEnd":"2011-04-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Matthias  Soller","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":" Most RNA binding proteins come in families, e.g. the ELAV/Hu protein family in our genetic model organism the fruitfly Drosophila has three members. They are highly related and are co-expressed in almost all neurons. Since they bind to very similar sequences, it has not been clear if they regulate the same genes. \nFrom the analysis of mutants in the three genes we made, we concluded that all have different mutant phenotypes, and hence mostly bind to different targets, but converge in the regulation of synaptic plasticity. Using a molecular genetic analysis of ELAV/Hu protein function, we discovered that their concentration and cellular localization are important determinants for target specificity meaning that they can take over each others function at elevated concentrations and in the correct cellular location. These findings have important implications for defining the splicing code and for predicting how genes are regulated based on sequence. Our findings have important implications for defining the splicing code and for predicting how genes are regulated based on sequence. Differences between humans are mostly found in non-coding regions where RNA binding proteins bind. Hence such sequence polymorphisms will affect how genes are expressed. In the future, drugs can be developed to modulate the binding of proteins to RNA and adjust gene expression to improve human well beeing. Healthcare","dataset":"gtr"}
