However, such work may not be feasible for those with major health problems and, depending on occupational and personal circumstances, might be either good or bad for health. Information on the factors that influence work participation at older ages can be used to optimise government and employer policies, to identify interventions to help older workers, and to improve the design of work for older people.</p>\n\n<p>This study will involve 6,000 people aged 50-64 years from 24 general practices across England. Practices contribute to the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), a research database maintained by a government agency, which logs all medical consultations, diagnoses, referrals, and treatments in 6 per cent of the population. CPRD linkage thus allows access to a rich objective seam of health information at low marginal cost.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Participants will complete questionnaires about their work and home circumstances, initially over 3-year follow-up. With consent, we will access their health data via the CPRD and link this to questionnaire responses.&nbsp;The inter-relation of changes in employment (with reasons) and changes in health (eg major new illnesses, new treatments, mortality) will be examined statistically.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L002663/1","grantId":"ES/L002663/1","fundValue":"154038","fundStart":"2013-11-03","fundEnd":"2016-11-02","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Keith T Palmer","coPersons":["David  Coggon","Catharine Rose Gale","Maria  Evandrou","Cyrus  Cooper","Avan  Aihie Sayer"],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
