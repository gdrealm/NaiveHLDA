The system will incorporate multiple functionalities to stimulate the production of new tissue and degradation of scar tissue, via incorporation of different peptide units. These will be cross-linked by UV radiation to form a fibrillar scaffold. The UV cross-linking can be performed in situ locally following topical application of a spray or cream. The system will act as a rigid &quot;filler&quot; scaffold for tissue regrowth. This approach is different to existing techniques. This technology is highly suited for the treatment of battlefield wounds in situ, as well as the treatment of burns and post-operative wounds. It will be developed to treat wounds to the skin as well as the cornea. The technology is expected to be fast acting and is based on ease of end-use application.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/J019836/1","grantId":"BB/J019836/1","fundValue":"122470","fundStart":"2013-01-01","fundEnd":"2013-12-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  They have been promoted at DSTL during the joint synthetic biology initiative open day there.\nWe have also published some of the research, with further papers in preparation.\nAspects have also been discussed with potential commercial partners.
