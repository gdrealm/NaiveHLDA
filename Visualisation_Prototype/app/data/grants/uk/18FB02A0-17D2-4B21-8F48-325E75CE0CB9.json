Changing prison demographics and anxieties that under certain conditions prisons may become incubators for terrorist ideology, have fuelled concerns over the role and nature of religious ideology and practice in prisons. Simultaneously, the flow of information about prisoners has moved away from prison landings and into security intelligence reporting systems, obscuring possibilities for faith as a source of growth, meaning, community, and trust.</p>\n\n<p>This project will explore how trust, risk, identity and prisoner leadership work in two contrasting maximum security prisons.The study aims to capture dynamics that encourage human flourishing, even in prison, rather than damage to character, which is an increasing risk. The methodology combines appreciative inquiry with ethnography-led measurement of key dimensions of the prison’s moral and social climate to explore where and how trust might ‘work’ in this contemporary setting. It will use innovative methods to study prisoner networks, hierarches and developing ideologies, to test the hypothesis that forms of identity expression take on a different character in different moral, social and trust climates.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L003120/1","grantId":"ES/L003120/1","fundValue":"196554","fundStart":"2013-09-01","fundEnd":"2015-02-28","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  The findings are now in the process of being analysed, and will be used in a research-based book-length monograph, under the title of 'Prisons and the Problem of Trust'. \n\nThe findings have also been used in two peer-reviewed articles, \n\nLiebling, A.

Prisons research as action', International Journal for Crime, Justice and Social Democracy Research undertaken to date on prison quality by the PI and Prisons Research Centre colleagues is being used in routine performance and audit measurement of all 138 prison establishments in England and Wales (as well as internationally). The conceptual framework (areas of prison life that matter most) and measurement techniques provide an extremely valuable cultural and relational reading of prison life, shown to be predictive of (for example) suicide risk, disorder and prisoners' personal development. This ongoing, developmental research has been used in policy development on prison size, comparisons of public vs private sector prisons, refining the competition process, providing advice to Governors of poor performing prisons, in understanding the work (and reviewing the pay of) of prison officers and senior managers, and in alerting the Prison Service to new risks (e.g. of radicalisation, and the effects of risk aversion). The current project would significantly enhance the conceptual and empirical reach of this survey tool, adding several important new dimensions, as well as methods, to its development. It will deepen our understanding as well as measurement of prison moral and social climates, in ways that have direct impact on the management and operation of prisons.\n\nThe impact of introducing the Social Field Generator for use in prison sociology and the identification of leadership, for example, will provide a significant methodological development in our field. The impact of drawing on theological insight more generally will, we hope, transform the field of prison sociology, both conceptually and empirically.\n\nWe aim to produce meaningful measures of 'political charge' and 'trust', for use in comparing and evaluating prisons, but also other settings (in particular where faith differences exist).
