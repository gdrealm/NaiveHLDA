{"id":"2BE92D00-F4C5-4F58-A48E-0FA8B9FFB185","title":"The role of p63 isoforms in head and neck cancers","abstractText":"When normal cells become cancerous they go through a phase called epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) which allows the cells to invade into other tissues. EMT also occurs during embryogenesis but here it is tightly controlled. We wish to study this process in oro-pharyngeal cancers which are cancers at the back of the oral cavity and are associated with infection by the human papillomaviruses (HPV) that cause genital cancers. It has recently been observed that patients with oro-pharyngeal cancer which contain HPV live longer than people whose cancers are HPV negative. We propose that the difference is due to the regulation of EMT, which we have shown can be controlled by p63, a family of proteins that are important for EMT during organ development. Our theory is the increased levels of p63 observed in HPV cancers protect against EMT and may contribute to the better prognosis seen in HPV positive cancers.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1001692","grantId":"G1001692","fundValue":"895374","fundStart":"2011-06-01","fundEnd":"2015-07-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Dennis John McCance","coPersons":["Jacqueline  James","Daksha  Patel"],"organisation":"Queen's University of Belfast","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
