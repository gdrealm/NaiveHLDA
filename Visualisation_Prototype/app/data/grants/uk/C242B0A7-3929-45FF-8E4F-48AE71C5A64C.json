{"id":"C242B0A7-3929-45FF-8E4F-48AE71C5A64C","title":"Catalogue of Italian Paintings in Glasgow Museums","abstractText":"No catalogue of the important collection of Italian paintings in Glasgow Museums has been published since 1935. The present project has resulted in a detailed scholarly catalogue of all 140 works (principally in the Kelvin Grove Museum and Art Gallery but also in the Burrell Collection and Pollok House), many of which are major works of art. All 140 have been analysed to provide basic information on dating, subject-matter, patronage and provenance. In many cases, the entries provide a balanced and up-to-date synthesis of existing research; in many others, they have involved new investigation and new assessment. As well as serving as an essential tool for professional art historians, the catalogue will provide a fundamental basis for the wider knowledge and appreciation of Glasgow's pictures, especially by way of the Museum's website.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/E503276/1","grantId":"AH/E503276/1","fundValue":"33481","fundStart":"2007-02-05","fundEnd":"2007-06-04","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter  Humfrey","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of St Andrews","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
