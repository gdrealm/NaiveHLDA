Yet most governments in developing countries see climate change purely as a rural problem with impacts on agriculture and food security. </p>\n\n<p>This research seeks to fill this important knowledge gap by exploring how to effectively address the problems of poor urban people, in a context of rapid climate change. It adopts a cross-disciplinary perspective bringing together a team of leading Bangladeshi and UK researchers. </p>\n\n<p>The analytical framework draws on three bodies of theory: </p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>political economy of urban change</li>\n\n <li>assets of poor urban people</li>\n\n <li>adaptive practices of poor people and institutions. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This research has five work packages: </p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>WP1 - inventory of challenges for the urban poor</li>\n\n <li>WP2 - analysis of adaptive practices</li>\n\n <li>WP3 - analysis of institutional structures</li>\n\n <li>WP4 - action research</li>\n\n <li>WP5 - analysis and policy findings. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These involve a variety of data collection methods: </p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>participatory livelihood analysis</li>\n\n <li>key informant interviews</li>\n\n <li>dialogue with local academics, policymakers and civil society groups</li>\n\n <li>action research. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Both qualitative and quantitative analyses of the data from our six field sites will feed into a comparative analysis, synthesis of findings and policy implications.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/H033793/1","grantId":"ES/H033793/1","fundValue":"449972","fundStart":"2010-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"David  Hulme","coPersons":["Ferdous  Jahan","Manoj Kumar Roy","Simon  Guy"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
