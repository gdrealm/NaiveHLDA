The game attracts young people attention and illustrate well the basic ideas of particle physics research. The feedback has been positive, and lead to several improvements, funded by the University of Birmingham in hiring summer students to further develop the game, including 3D graphics. The game is still used in Outreach events.

Specifically, players are asked to build and run an international laboratory, including hiring people and manage resources, and conduct research in order to discover the Higgs boson. The game is meant to communicate the fascination of particle physics while educating the player to proper physics concepts about particles in general, the Higgs boson specifically and the topic of particle detection at large. The Particle Game is downloadable from web, and can be used in schools to enlarge the curriculum. It is also used at outreach events. Education","dataset":"gtr"}
