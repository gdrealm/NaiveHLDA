{"id":"6518EDC1-7378-4B7E-B4B5-4C06407DE414","title":"Photography and the Transnational Politics of Affect","abstractText":"Photographs bear tremendous emotional and affective power thanks to their intimate and necessary relationship to the material world, their 'having-been-there' quality. Disseminated across an evolving range of media and spanning geographical distances, historical periods, and cultural and linguistic divides, photographs are routinely presented for everyday consumption, calling on us to recognise our fellow human beings in moments of crisis and duress: from the all-too familiar images documenting successive waves of famine and disease, through those that bear witness to the action and destruction of war or 'natural' disasters and their aftermath, to the photo ops staged in the arena of struggles for human rights. As they circulate in the global public sphere, such photographs invite patterns of identification, mobilizing shame, inciting outrage, hatred, fear, compassion, etc. The very fact that they continue to circulate testifies to the on-going belief in their power to communicate affect transnationally and ultimately to effect change.\\n\\nHowever, despite the enduring historical relationship between photography and the affective, photography scholarship has yet to examine the emotional aspects of the medium's persuasive power. Our network therefore aims to address two overarching questions. First, how has photography emerged as one of the key modes in the representation of political events, and consequently framed what is visible and hence, sayable? Second, how do photographs serve as vehicles for the transnational communication of affect, and therefore aid (or hinder) the formation of (political) communities based around these emotional attachments? The research speaks directly to the relationship between visuality and politics, and is relevant to research and photographic practice that seeks to engage with the work that photographs do in relation to social change, human rights, and the public sphere. Conceived as an international and interdisciplinary project, the network has been designed to straddle the boundary between the academic community and other stakeholders, including photographers, curators, journalists, human rights activists and representatives of NGOs.\\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/I027134/1","grantId":"AH/I027134/1","fundValue":"35261","fundStart":"2012-01-01","fundEnd":"2013-12-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Andrea  Noble","coPersons":["Edward  Welch"],"organisation":"Durham University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
