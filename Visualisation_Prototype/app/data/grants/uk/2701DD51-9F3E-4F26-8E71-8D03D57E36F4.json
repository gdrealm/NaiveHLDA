Soils subjected to such inputs may retain the imprint of these activities. This imprint, commonly microscopic, can show how societies managed their surrounding landscapes. Soils can therefore act as a record of past cultural activities; the examination of such cultural soils forms the major element of Ground-breaking. Data obtained from the soil imaging is used as a source for generative audio and visual exploration with photomicrographs and related contextual images processed and animated. Combined with environmental sound recordings from the Lake Chad region, these recordings are used in conjunction synthesized materials, and are subject to real-time granular processing and dynamic filtering. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-168-26-0115","grantId":"RES-168-26-0115","fundValue":"1948","fundStart":"2007-03-01","fundEnd":"2007-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Paul  Adderley","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Stirling","findingsText":" This project was designed to allow the development of a sci-art installation for public display to develop a means of exploring the linkages between human societies and their reactions to extereme environments. This was successfully achieved with displays at national museums in Scotland and Czech Republic as well as at leading galleries and museums elesewhere in the UK. This whole project was designed around public engagement. The research undertaken was aimed at developing a deeper public understandsing of science. Environment","dataset":"gtr"}
