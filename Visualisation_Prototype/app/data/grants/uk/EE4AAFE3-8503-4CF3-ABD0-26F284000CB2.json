Therefore a key question for research is how to support them effectively to sustain ICT usage as their capabilities change so that they can continue to access the benefits. This grant funds a new multi-disciplinary network to explore and understand the factors which lie behind the transition from user to non-user, and explore potential solutions which could help to defer or even prevent this transition from occurring.</p>\n\n<p>The network combines the expertise of existing research collaborations with that of product developers, technology providers and telecommunications specialists and, crucially, with older people as ICT users and their representatives to bring a powerful multi-disciplinary perspective to the research question. The specific objectives are to share knowledge and expertise in order to define the problems, understand the requirements, explore the state of the art with regard to potential solutions, map the gaps and develop a collaborative research proposal for submission to the third call of the New Dynamics of Ageing programme.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-351-25-0134","grantId":"RES-351-25-0134","fundValue":"19920","fundStart":"2006-11-01","fundEnd":"2007-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Leela  Damodaran","coPersons":["Christine Wendy Olphert"],"organisation":"Loughborough University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
