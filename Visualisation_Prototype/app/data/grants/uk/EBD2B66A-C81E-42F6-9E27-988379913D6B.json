The project is an interdisciplinary collaboration between sociology and linguistics.&nbsp;The project will deliver both methodological innovations and substantive original findings in the area of gender, illness experience and language. Secondary analysis of a large archive of interviews with people describing their experiences of illness, gathered in association with the Dipex website project (<a href=\"http://www.dipex.org.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.dipex.org.uk</a>) is at the core of the project. As well as being of interest to sociologists and linguists in the academy, these findings will contribute to a better understanding of the needs and concerns of people with a variety of illnesses, thus informing clinicians, carers and health information providers. Methodologically the project will deliver a comparative assessment of the features of qualitative interviews and postings in web-based forums, thus evaluating the latter as a research resource. Different types of text analysis software for delivering findings will be assessed, with a particular focus on the effect of ‘built-in’ interpretive schemes, such as word dictionaries.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E002498/1","grantId":"ES/E002498/1","fundValue":"111825","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2008-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Clive  Seale","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Brunel University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
