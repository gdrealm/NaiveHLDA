The governance of care policy, constitutional change and addressing inequalities - lessons for Scotland - INVITED RESUBMISSION","abstractText":"<p>Scotland is not alone in facing a ‘care crisis’; rising demand for care and support for disabled and older people coupled with social, economic and demographic changes is a challenge facing all developed welfare states. Scotland is also not alone in trying to tackle structural inequalities (particularly along the lines of gender, disability and age) which affect its ability to achieve a ‘wealthier, fairer society’, and in particular focusing on fostering economic growth through older people’s, disabled people’s and women’s greater participation in public life. This project will address the following questions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>What does the international evidence tell us about the potential for care policy to address or exacerbate inequalities?</li>\n\n <li>What governance options offer the best outcomes in addressing inequalities through care policy?</li>\n\n <li>What role do national, regional and local care policies play in achieving equitable, fair outcomes in care policy?</li>\n\n <li>What governance options in care policy should Scotland choose to achieve equitable, fair outcomes in care policy?</li>\n\n <li>How would constitutional change (eg independence, or different governance structures) affect these options?</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K01093X/1","grantId":"ES/K01093X/1","fundValue":"202167","fundStart":"2013-11-01","fundEnd":"2016-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Kirstein  Rummery","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Stirling","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
