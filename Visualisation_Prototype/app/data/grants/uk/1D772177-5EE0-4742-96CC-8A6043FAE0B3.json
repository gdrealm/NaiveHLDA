This study explores support for maternal and infant health in a range of ethnic and social groups. A new approach will be used to answer the following questions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>What is the nature and extent of social networks for maternal and child health In England and how are these shaped by ethnicity, religious identity, social class and gender?</li>\n\n <li>What interventions to address barriers to maternal and child health are suggested by women who have experienced an infant mortality and how effectively can these be translated into practice?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The study will review current knowledge from existing literature and databases and from policymakers and practitioners. Sixty women from a range of backgrounds in two matched groups will also be interviewed - those who have (i) experienced an infant death (ii) a healthy child after 1 year. Interviews will explore the extent and nature of women's social networks for health and identify gaps in support. </p>\n\n<p>Women interviewed will be supported to develop and test solutions that address the problems identified, using methods that model the structural change needed to reduce inequalities in health. <br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/I01036X/1","grantId":"ES/I01036X/1","fundValue":"314664","fundStart":"2010-12-01","fundEnd":"2013-12-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Ghazala  Mir","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":" Key Findings from the project are:\n\n• Risk factors involving individual, biological and social issues affected women from higher risk groups. Bereaved women, their families and professionals often had poor knowledge of potential pregnancy complications resulting in delays reporting or responding to warning signs. Many bereaved women felt they had been failed by professionals through missed opportunities to intervene effectively. For minority ethnic women, only congenital anomalies received significant policy and research attention, and this did not increase access to genetic screening or counselling for consanguineous couples.\n• Practitioners often focused on causes external to maternity services whereas bereaved women highlighted problems in healthcare settings. Implementation of NICE guidance (2010) in relation to pregnancy and complex social factors was lacking for minority ethnic women.\n\n• Over 80 potential sources of support were identified. Non-bereaved women often named more network contacts than bereaved women despite having fewer health needs. Less targeted provision existed for women from minority ethnic backgrounds compared to teenagers.\n• Bereaved women were more dependent on primary care professionals to develop knowledge and support specific to maternity. Many White British non-bereaved women deliberately developed their support networks during maternity to fill perceived gaps in knowledge and emotional support.\n\n• Women rated personal contacts more highly than professionals in terms of overall contribution to wellbeing, however, bereaved women gave lower average scores for key family members.\n• Non-bereaved women were more likely to receive emotional support from professionals and rated GPs, midwives and health visitors more highly on average than non-bereaved women. More bereaved women reported poor empathy and hostility from staff and\nfeeling vulnerable during birth.\n• Bereaved women felt their social position and that of their family and friends was much lower than professionals in maternity services, whereas non bereaved women on average felt their status was closer to that of midwives and health visitors.\n\n• The HOPE support groups of bereaved women were established during the project's participatory phase. Women identified key priorities in the areas of relationships, knowledge and service design and wanted more involvement in decisions around how services are run.\n• HOPE members formed links with key professionals, including the Maternity Services Liaison Committee, Public Health Officers and health visiting, midwifery and neonatal leads. Bereaved women's perspectives could sometimes be hard for professionals to hear and some reacted defensively; those who engaged focused on finding solutions rather than taking criticism personally.\n• Participatory methods empowered women to have a voice in how health and social care services were run. The study provides evidence that groups like HOPE are feasible and can have a considerable impact on service development.\n\nThe study demonstrates that participatory groups are an effective mechanism for engaging marginalised groups in service development and knowledge transfer and increasing their social capital. A number of bereaved women who became involved in the participatory research phase of the study have worked with researchers to achieve the following service development/ structural change:\n•A healthcare pathway for women in high risk groups developed by senior staff for the health visiting service in Bradford and supported by senior midwifery staff.\n•Representation of HOPE members on the Maternity Services Liaison Committees in Leeds and Bradford\n•A Neonatal Service User Group at Bradford Royal Infirmary (BRI)\n•Accessible bereavement support meetings organised by national charity SANDS and befriender training for HOPE members\n•A national SANDS project to make bereavement support accessible to South Asian communities\n•Memory diaries for parents and culturally appropriate bereavement support resources for Muslim parents at BRI neonatal unit\n•Public Health Leeds and National Childbirth Trust Bradford support for Hope members to continue after project completion\n\nAt a research workshop involving bereaved women service development commitments made by professional participants included:\n•Monthly face-to-face health visiting and midwifery meetings to support joint initiatives in Bradford\n•Work on staff diversity to attract BME student nurses/ midwives to BRI Neonatal Unit, recruiting from a local Doula scheme\n•Gathering feedback on satisfaction with interpreting from families and providers; training for Bradford neonatal and health visiting staff on working with interpreters\n•Improving liaison and giving more information to Leeds community midwives before visits e.g. information about infant deaths via a new IT link;\n•Centralised hospital records providing professionals with details of a mother's medical history\n•A checklist for midwives to identify higher risk women at Leeds delivery suite\n•Supporting parents' early contributions to case reviews of infant death\n•Addressing gaps in bereavement counselling provision\n\nFindings from the study have been disseminated to other academics and practitioners at various events and could influence their work. (see Engagement Activities). \n\nAdvice about findings has been sought by a member of the Equalities Team at NHS England in relation to strategic decision-making about services for children and young people. \n\nFollow on funding for further research was secured from the West Yorkshire Clinical Research Network following the study's adoption by the NIHR CRN Portfolio . This will be used to build on existing findings about interventions and care pathways that could effectively reduce rates of infant mortality in Pakistani, African and Caribbean populations. This work could potentially lead to an application for research funding to trial and evaluate a complex health intervention.\n\nTwo 4th Year medical students and a doctoral Clinical Psychology student are carrying out linked research as part of their studies at the University of Leeds to explore support for parents in consanguineous relationships and experiences of bereavement support.
