Vectors are important tools which have been used to investigate basic biology, including how genes function, how cells work and what controls the process of animal development. Many diseases are caused by faulty genes and so recently vectors have also been developed for use in gene therapy; where a functional copy of a gene is used to fix the defect. The most effective vectors have been developed from viruses which have evolved over millions of years to deliver genetic material into cells. To make viruses into safe tools, or medicines, the pathogenic properties of the virus have been removed so the virus can be produced simply in a laboratory for carrying specific genes of interest. The Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is a lentivirus that has been made safe and is a commonly used vector for delivering genes to cells. This vector is very effective and has been used in clinical gene therapy trials. When HIV normally infects a target cell, it delivers its genetic payload directly into the host cell chromosomes and integrates it seamlessly, so that the viral DNA becomes part of the cell's genome or 'book of life'. This is very important for long-term experiments or treatments, because the DNA is delivered permanently. However, despite the fact that vectors are unable to cause infection, there are problems and side effects associated with integrating genes into the host cell's chromosomes. Not all of a cell's DNA is active; there are large regions of the genome that do not produce any product from the information that they contain. If the virus, or vector, inserts its payload into one of these regions, the chances of it functioning are reduced. Additionally, cells have also changed and evolved over millions of years to defend against DNA that is being delivered into them by viruses (or vectors derived from them). Mechanisms are present that can shut off production (or expression) from delivered genes and silence them. Lastly, a side effect of inserting DNA into a cell is that it can interfere with cell's own DNA and damage or alter existing genes. This is unlikely to cause any problems but if, when treating a person with an inherited disease, it affects a gene involved in controlling how a cell grows or replicates, then this can lead to cancer. Although this is a very small risk, it has unfortunately been observed in gene therapy clinical trials. An alternative is to use an HIV vector that has been altered to prevent it from inserting the DNA it is carrying into the target cell chromosome. These vectors are called integration deficient lentiviral vectors or IDLVs. These are no longer capable of integrating into the cell's genome, but this vector retains all other benefits of the integrating version. This has several consequences: Firstly, it should be safer. Because the delivered DNA does not integrate, it cannot disrupt any of the cell's own genes and this reduces the risk of causing cancer in patients. Interestingly, despite avoiding the problems associated with integrating into silent areas of the genome, IDLV do not work equally well in all cell types when compared to integrating versions of the vector, for reasons that are not clear. While they have been shown to effectively express genes in brain, eye and muscle tissue, they perform worse in liver and stem cells when compared to integrating vectors. This block could be due to many factors but because IDLVs represent a safer and viable alternative to those that integrate, it is important to investigate the reasons to find solutions or to ensure that expression of delivered genes is not eventually affected in tissues where they initially seem to work well. The aim of this project therefore is to determine factors that influence how integration defective lentiviral vectors function in different situations and use that information to produce an improved vector.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I00212X/1","grantId":"BB/I00212X/1","fundValue":"370734","fundStart":"2011-05-09","fundEnd":"2014-05-08","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The aim of this project was to investigate the biology of integration-deficient lentiviral vectors.

These viruses are used to deliver genes for numerous clinical or basic-science applications and the standard, multiply attenuated and disabled vector integrates its genetic payload into the target cell's chromosomes. Mutant versions of this vector are available which cannot integrate, and so on many levels are considered safer and there is much interest in the development and application of these vectors. However, the amount of gene expression from the mutant non integrating form is generally reduced in comparison to the integration proficient vector, and a major goal of this project was to investigate why.\nThe most significant achievements from this grant to date are the optimisation of a technique to determine the location of the integration deficient lentiviral vector (IdLV) in the nucleus of a cell, which will inform us of whether this has any impact on expression levels of genes carried on the episomal (DNA that hasn't been integrated into the host cell chromosome). Additionally, we have developed a novel vector with the majority of the remaining unwanted HIV sequence removed. This has not been previously achieved and allows for further testing and understanding of the virus, whether it integrates or not.\nThe initial objectives of the project have not been fully met, although we expect ongoing analysis of data obtained through experimentation to provide the basis for a publication shortly.\nThe findings will be of importance to other researchers internationally who are applying IdLV to in range of different situations to answer biological questions in cells that are difficult to deliver DNA to.\n\nDetails are below:\n\nInterim project findings.\n\nThis project aims to determine why integrating forms of HIV-1 - based lentiviral vectors express at higher levels than those which contain a mutation to prevent integration into the host cell chromosomes (Integration Proficient Lentiviral Vector, IpLV, versus Integration Deficient Lentiviral vector, IdLV).\n- The pCMV-dR8.74 and pCMV-dR8.74 D64V (Yanez) plasmids which are used to package the virus in producer cells were sequenced. This identified a 2kb region of Gag-Pol containing over 80 nucleotide and 20 amino acid mismatches. A literature search revealed that Yanez et al 2006 cloned this region from a different HIV-1 strain when generating the D64V plasmid. We obtained pCMV-dR8.74 D64V from Dr Luis Apolonia differing from pCMV-dR8.74 only at the D64V residue (confirmed by sequencing). All 3 vectors were prepared in parallel and no difference in functional titre was observed. The reduced expression from IdLVs does not appear to be due to mutations in Gag-Pol other than D64V.\n - We have synthesised a new qPCR standard containing multiple target amplicons on single molecule so that the same standards could be used for different primer and probe sets in order to improve reproducibility. These standards were used to compare IpLV/SEW and IdLV/SEW expression and vector copy number titres in 293T cells. The results indicated that the frequency of expression per copy (%eGFP+) is the same between IpLV and IdLV proviruses, but the intensity of expression (MFI) is 18-fold less for IdLVs. These data suggest that IdLV proviruses are no more likely to undergo complete silencing than IpLVs, but expression from active copies is not as strong.\n - We transduced the pluripotent teratocarcinoma-derived P19 cell line with both IpLV/SEW and IdLV/SEW. The DNA was used to set up validated bisulphite-PCR primer sets for all HIV-1 backbone elements (5' LTR, PBS, packaging signal, RRE, 3' LTR) and the SFFV promoter. A 14 day timecourse experiment revealed earlier methylation of the packaging signal than the internal promoter in IpLVs as previously reported. The packaging signal and internal SFFV promoter in IdLV DNA appeared to be significantly less methylated by P19 cells than those in IpLV DNA 5 days after transduction. Methylation is associated with epigenetic control of expression levels and so is important in this context.\n - We met with Peter Fraser at Babraham Institute to discuss the practicality of chromosome conformation capture (4C) experiments to track the nuclear localisation of IpLV and IdLV proviruses in order to study the possibility that differences in provirus localisation affect access to the transcriptional machinery. He provided his 4C protocol and we adapted this for lentiviral LM-PCR. Provirus-chromosome junctions were successfully recovered from transduced 293T cells by 4C-LMPCR. The method is currently being optimised before processing the remainder of 4C material. The LM-PCR libraries will undergo next generation sequencing and bioinformatics analysis to detect differences in nuclear localisation between IpLV and IdLV proviruses.\n\nUpdated findings November 2014\n\nThe importance of methylation in control of expression levels from integration deficient lentiviral vectors is ongoing. We have confirmed the original observations that integrated vectors (IpLV) are more methylated in P19 cells than integration deficient vectors (IdLV). Because this observation is counterintuitive (methylation of sequences is normally associated with a reduction in expression) we have collaborated with Dr Tristan McKay (St Georges University London) to test these vectors in an alternative system using ES cell lines to test the results. These experiments are technically demanding, not least because the IdLV dilutes from dividing cultures and so later time-points are difficult to obtain signal from. We have now optimised the bisulfite-PCR sequencing and have material ready to test from the ES cell cultures.\nExperiments applying chromosome conformation capture (4C) have been carried out to adapt and validate the method to determine whether the location in the nucleus of the integration-defective episomes affects expression. \nNext generation sequencing has been performed on 4C samples from IdLV and IpLV treated cells, including controls. Because of the novelty of this work, we have had to approach experts in bioinformatics to help analyse and interpret the results, and so we are now collaborating with groups internationally. Preliminary work suggests that the IdLV may still be tethered to the DNA, and this is being checked with several analytical methods.\nThe relationship between methylation and expression from vector genomes is not definite and so alongside experiments outlined above, we have also adapted the study to take a novel approach at investigating the role of 'spacer' DNA upstream of the transcriptional unit. Work by Mark Kay and colleagues has demonstrated that in standard plasmids the presence of DNA between the end of the gene and the start of the gene (on a circular molecule) can interfere with transcription to a greater degree than methylation of the sequence. To test whether this is having an impact in the circular episome formed by IdLV, we have produced a novel vector, called LTR-1, with much of that region deleted. Despite efforts by many other groups, this has not been achieved to the level we have produced. This vector is now being used to test the hypothesis, but also because of the novel way which we have managed to delete most of the remaining HIV DNA, we are also fully characterising the vector and have planned follow on work which forms the basis of award BB/L024357/1. Information gained from this work can be put to use not only by basic biological labs, but also in more applied settings, such as clinical applications of gene therapy using retroviral vectors and production of biotherapeutics (such as antibodies) in cell lines. The information gained so far is of use in a wider biological context, to understand the mechanisms of gene silencing and control of transcription, or how a gene product is produced, in cells. This research could be applied in many different areas, immediately and further when we have more complete information at the end of the grant. This would be of interest to researchers and companies in medical and veterinary sciences, biomedicine and developmental / basic biologists as a research tool, as well as many others. Interest in integration deficient vectors is still high as many groups would like to use transient gene expression to reprogramme cells (such as induced pluripotent stem cells) or assess a pulse of expression of transcription factors or other genes and IdLV can provide this.
