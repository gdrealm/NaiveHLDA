In this context German historians have so far paid little attention to sources which have met with increasing interest in British research over the past years, namely letters, applications and petitions written by or for paupers to their home parish in order to apply for relief. Such 'pauper narratives' are preserved in British as well as in German archives, often in large numbers and alongside begging letters and other narratives.\nThis project proposes: to collect and edit on-line a range of pauper narratives from comparable British and German communities over the period between 1770 and 1914; to analyse the linguistic structure and content of these narratives. This will be accomplished at three levels: an IT-based analysis of the linguistic similarities and differences between narrative forms; the quantitative study of recurring phrases, rhetorical forms and strategic reasoning within each narrative form; and the systematic comparison of the linguistic content of narratives with a corpus of other material written by or for ordinary people, including autobiographies, radical speeches and familial letters; the use of these sources and the linguistic analysis to explore issues such as the degree to, which the British and German poor claimed or developed agency when it came to entitlement; the use of political language and participation in the political process by the poor; and-the strategic and rhetorical methods (including for instance claiming belonging or Christian duty) used, by the poor to establish or maintain deservingness.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/I500561/1","grantId":"AH/I500561/1","fundValue":"243558","fundStart":"2011-05-01","fundEnd":"2014-04-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  One of the key goals for our project was the bringing together or a major comparative online edition of pauper letters. 'Publication' of the edition and a related website will be reported in the next submission to ResearchFish but in the meantime beta versions of the edition and individual packages of material have been shared with more than 100 other scholarly users. In addition the material has informed the public and policy engagement and further funding applications reported elsewhere in this submission.

To collect pauper narratives and associated data for England, Wales, Scotland and Germany.\n2. To select from the resulting database a corpus of letters that could form an online edition;\n3. To analyse the construction, intent, outcome and meaning of the letters.\n\nOur online edition has been through a number of beta version and will be ready to go live in the next quarter. In addition to that material we have collected a wider corpus which we are making available to scholars and family historians via a database. In terms of the research on the material itself, three key findings emerge:\n\n1. That while the poor lacked legal rights for most of the period covered in our grant, they nonetheless retained considerable agency, founded on the basis of customary or moral right, the limitations of statute law and the locally negotiable nature of welfare.\n2. That agency meant certain groups of the poor came to be treated well in the historic welfare system or at least in a manner that should lead us to question ingrained senses of the past. Nowhere is this clearer than in the area of disability ,where the evidence from pauper letters is that the extension of legal rights led to the erosion of moral rights for the disabled and consequently to more marginalisation and worse treatment.\n3. That the ability to talk ones way through the welfare system was a crucial variable in the exercise of agency. Form-based welfare systems, on the other hand, left fewer avenues for an honest conversation about the limits of state obligations and the extent of individual responsibilities. We envisage thee further steps forward:\n\n1. The use of the material collected for the edition ad underlying database to prompt or contribute to further radio and television programmes in both English and German.\n2. The material itself raises absolutely key questions about the agency of those trying to navigate the welfare system. While the data is historic, the key questions that it raises - how might the poor exercise agency; how did they establish belonging and entitlement; how did the poor navigate the law - are as relevant today as in the past. The EU grant won by King and reported elsewhere in thus submission, has this matter of belonging at its core and we envisage more policy contributions of this sort. \n3. The material offers the chance to bring historical perspective to debates which are seen as somehow modern. Our evidence on patient case records reported elsewhere in this submission points to the need to inject historical understanding into modern policy debates and we intend to do more of this work.
