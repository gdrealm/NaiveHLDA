{"id":"0B4F7107-FA22-4D02-A7CF-67F22A1640DE","title":"Derivation of clinical grade embryonic stem cell lines","abstractText":"Human embryonic stem (hES) cells can be isolated from early (6 day old) developing embryos which have been grown in the laboratory as part of, or surplus to some kinds of IVF treatment. Under certain conditions, these cells can be made to develop into different kinds of tissues, such as nerve cells or pancreatic cells which it is hoped in the future, may be useful in treating degenerative diseases such as Parkinson s disease and diabetes, or in spinal injuries by replacing the diseased or damaged cells with healthy hES cells which have been grown in the laboratory. The number of hES cell lines that have been developed worldwide that are suitable for clinical use is still very limited. Further research is required to find out the best means to grow them in ways that will allow them to be safe for clinical use which is the purpose of this grant. All stem cell derivation from embryos is strictly monitored in the UK and requires a licence from the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA). In compliance with conditions of our HFEA licence, samples of any suitable stem cell lines developed will be sent to the UK Stem Cell Bank from where they are made available to research scientists in the UK and abroad through the MRC Stem Cell Steering Committee, and if suitable, for further preparation in the UKSCB for clinical use. With the Assisted Conception Unit (ACU) at Guy s, we have developed ethical ways of obtaining embryos for deriving stem cell lines that may be suitable for clinical use, especially from couples who have successfully undergone IVF treatment and have additional embryos in frozen storage which they no longer wish to use in their own treatment, nor wish to donate to other individuals. Rather than destroy them, patients often prefer to donate them for stem cell or other worthwhile research.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0801061","grantId":"G0801061","fundValue":"801730","fundStart":"2009-03-19","fundEnd":"2013-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"DUSKO  ILIC","coPersons":["Alan  Colman"],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
