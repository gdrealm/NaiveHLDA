We found that many people buried at Bamburgh were not locally born and raised with some possibly even coming from as far away as north Africa. There were also differences in health between the 'origin groups'. Diet was surprisingly lacking in a marine component (a coastal site), and there was much dental disease, mores than many contemporary populations. Addressing debates about migration into the UK, and that it has been happening for a long time; we show a deeper time perspective. Health differences were also seen between migrants and locally born and raised people who were buried at Bamburg; again this can contribute to debates about the health of migrants today versus indigenous communities Healthcare,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections","dataset":"gtr"}
