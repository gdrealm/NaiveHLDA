{"id":"BDAE870D-896E-4ADE-B757-5A158FAC057A","title":"Prevention of Coordination Failures","abstractText":"Economic agents have often an incentive to act as other agents do. For instance, such situation arises during a bank run - the depositors are better off by withdrawing their deposits when other depositors run on the bank. A common feature of such strategic situations is strategic fragility. For instance, in the case of the bank run, all the depositors may coordinate on the run andwithdraw the savings even if the bank would be healthy in the equilibrium without the run.\n<br />Given such fragility, coordination outcomes are extremely sensitive to subtle details of the &quot;rules of the game&quot;. This sensitivity on one hand complicates the economic research in this area, but on the other hand, because of the sensitivity, the outcomes of the research may have large practical value. Because of the sensitivity, an authority may greatly enhance efficient coordination of many decentralized agents solely by subtle interventions.&nbsp; On one frontier, the proposed research will contribute to the general theoretical framework which is currently used by economists to predict the coordination outcomes. On a more applied frontier, it will use the existing theoretical framework to examine applied questions such as the efficiency effects of reversibility options in dynamic coordination games.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F041845/1","grantId":"ES/F041845/1","fundValue":"34079","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-07-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  This grant has ended in 2009 so there is nothing to report.
