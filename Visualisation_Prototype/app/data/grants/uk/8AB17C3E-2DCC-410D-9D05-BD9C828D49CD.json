{"id":"8AB17C3E-2DCC-410D-9D05-BD9C828D49CD","title":"RIDERS: Research In Interactive Drama Environments, Role-Play and Story-telling","abstractText":"The development of interactive graphical environments, mobile platforms, augmented reality and pervasive environments offers new technology resources for the creation of interactive drama, role-play and story-telling whether for entertainment, education, therapy or art. But what is the scientific and theoretical basis for these new media? How is it possible to reconcile the free interaction users expect in such environments with the satisfying narrative structures authors would like to design up front? Researchers have been trying to answer these questions in a range of often disparate disciplines: Computer Science and AI (e.g. planning, HCI, affective computing, digital gaming); Humanities (e.g narratology, digital media studies); Arts (e.g interactive installations, interactive drama); and Psychology (e.g user engagement, auto-biographical memory). Industrially, computer games companies have tried to find pragmatic and implementable solutions too in order to attract a wider range of gamers and move to more complex emotional engagement than the tension and adrenaline of shooting baddies. This network will bring together researchers in the many different disciplines involved so as to breach the current barriers between them, reduce fragmentation and create a synergy between technology development, theoretical analysis and practitioner applications. It will reach out to the creative industries in which new experiences and artefacts are being produced on a significant economic scale and to practitioners in relevant areas such as live and board-based role-play. It thus aligns with the objectives of the EPSRC Digital Economy programme.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I032037/1","grantId":"EP/I032037/1","fundValue":"106745","fundStart":"2011-09-01","fundEnd":"2015-05-01","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  IS book currently been written by small group of European, UK and USA members introduced via RIDERS project.

The RIDERS website - www.riders-project.net - an inviting hub signing up members and collating research material via text assets, urls to IS tools, systems and software downloads, blogging tool, full access for members to upload research material or to advertise up and coming IS events or opportunities, exchange reports, twitter feed, extensive video coverage of specialist IS speakers giving talking at RIDERS events and workshops. The RIDERS website has 120 members spanning UK, Europe, USA and Australia, with membership still growing. \n\n2. RIDERS themed events and workshop held across the UK; specific IS themes were targeted with expert speakers invited to share their cutting edge knowledge with the network. These themed events have been a great success. It was fed back directly by individual RIDERS members attending these events that they benefited greatly from the opportunity to meet peers across the wider industry and to share their research, as well as gain new IS knowledge. Some members used the events for networking future collaborations. The events and workshops were deliberately small to allow deepening of relationships but diverse in skill set to enable lots of group participation with researchers from different backgrounds. Findings were the mix of technical and artistic IS researchers in group participation work was particularly fruitful for building bridges and opening dialogues between different disciplines that normally might not access each other. \n\nExamples of some of the events/workshops that RIDERS ran over the last 3 years are listed below under themes explored:\n\na. Interactive Storytelling overview: scoping out the problem.\nWorkshop held in April 2012 at the University Of Birmingham to explore the language of stories, their potential for interaction, and how to make them accessible for researchers across genres and industries. Event and workshop also given in November 2012 at Queen Mary's University with international guest speaker Ernest Adams on the challenges of creating a story-like experience in a persistent world.\n\nb. Authoring and evaluating: Collaborative design and effective and robust evaluation for future entertainment technologies. Workshop held in June 2012 at University of York focusing the group on interaction role-pay and story development. Follow up event/workshop held in April 2013 at Sheffield University on authoring and evaluation within Interactive Storytelling, with group participation and feed back of Alex Mitchellâ€™s developmental research tool, HypeDyn.\n\nc. Interactive drama, role-play and story-telling: Lessons from designing and developing interactive drama, role-play or story-telling systems. Event/workshop held at Manchester Digital Laboratory (MadLab) in November 2013 looking at Creative Reading Writing and Film within Interactive Storytelling, and allowing the group to experience digital writer Nathan Jones experimental creative narrative writing. \n\nd. Narrative Interaction: A live role-playing workshop: Reconciling interactive users with past and current understanding of narratives. LARP workshop held at Heriot Watt University in August 2013 using experiential nordic style LARP with lectures from specialist speakers on different aspects of role play design and implementation.\n\ne. Public engagement: Workshop on designing interactive drama experiences involving members of the public. Collaboration with Scottish International Story-telling Center and Hartmut Koenitz - the collaboration introduced IS developments to a wider, less expert but equally interested IS audience which confirmed ongoing findings that IS tools and systems being developed need to aim for tighter collaboration and alignment with the end authors using the tools to create stories for optimal user friendly interfaces for the end product. A RIDERS/CIRCLE collaboration was also held at the University of Edinburgh April 2014 to bring together a cross-discipline group experience of story adaptation with Mel Woods' bespoke Mini Story-storm workshop created for RIDERS. \n\n3. SUMMER SCHOOL: a hands on week bringing together mature researchers and PHD students. The program explored 3D Film making, Comics within digital narrative, live action role-play design and audio mixing in depth, with the group creating a mini-comic and audio project to present to the group on closure. The final project work is documented on the website in the research section. \n\n4. Research Exchanges: RIDERS members were enabled to cross exchange research information at the IS conference at Santa Cruz, The British Libary, and Heriot Watt Digital Lab. Findings for the exchanges are documented in the Exchange Reports section of the website, including feedback from delegates on how the exchange influenced their research: www.riders-project.net/funding/previous-participants/ \n\n5. IS book to publish in USA during 2015. This book will be a collaborative effort of contributions from cross-discipline experts brought together via the RIDERS network. They have gathered material via a writers retreat, allocated tasks and progressed the book via regular skype sessions. The aim is to detail the process of designing an IS story taking into account known facts and accumulated findings gathered during the RIDERS project. The book called xxx is being written by a small number of European, UK and USA authors lead by Professor Ruth Aylett and Dr Sandy Louchart. The book findings will be shared with the international IS community. The success of the RIDERS project and the feedback from network members confirms a need for networking events and opportunities amongst IS cross-discipline experts within interactive storytelling. The technical experts and the artistic authors at best don't cross paths to communicate their work, or at worst, within academia or the wider industry work in isolation. The RIDERS network created a unique window to bring these diverse researchers together. \n\nThe website will stay as a legacy of IS information; extensive video footage will remain published, documenting IS experts disseminating their area of research amongst peers. Members could in theory continue to grow/advertise their own events via the RIDERS website with minimal maintenance required. \n\nFindings have been that there may be some value to have RIDERS bi-annual conferences, to build on the successful RIDERS formula of using themed IS events to explore IS and bring together cross-discipline expertise. If it came to be, the RIDERS conferences could be held for a week, twice a year, in Scotland and England, near good transport systems.
