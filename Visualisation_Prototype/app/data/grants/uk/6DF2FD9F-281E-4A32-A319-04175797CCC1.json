{"id":"6DF2FD9F-281E-4A32-A319-04175797CCC1","title":"Evolution of Earth's large-scale topography in the Cenozoic","abstractText":"The scoping study will bring together experts in geophysical observations of topography, geological proxies\nof subsidence, uplift and paleoaltimetry, lithospheric mechanics, computational fluid dynamics, seismology\nand mineral physics, to produce an action plan for a directed expenditure that will allow us to determine\nEarth's topography and bathymetry for the last 60 My - and set the boundary conditions for understanding\nthe long-term carbon cycle, changes in sea-level and large past climatic extremes.\nA strategic program is necessary in order to weave these threads together in the form of a comprehensive\nmodel of long-wavelength topography and its driving forces over the Cenozoic. Ties between communities\nthat do not normally interact strongly must be forged: between those with expertise in the shallowest crust\nand the deepest mantle, and between those with expertise in observational data and dynamical modeling. In\norder to make progress sustained effort must be devoted to bringing together observational constraints on\npaleotopography from the geologic record and models of whole mantle structure and circulation. Among the\nfundamental challenges to be overcome are the large range of length scales involved, from that of sedimentary\nbasins to that of tectonic plates, and the large range of time scales, from that of river incision to plate\nrearrangements.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/J024813/1","grantId":"NE/J024813/1","fundValue":"14194","fundStart":"2012-01-01","fundEnd":"2012-06-30","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Carolina Raquel Lithgow-Bertelloni","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":" It was a grant for a workshop.
