Cytoplasmic polyadenylation is a form of this regulation by which the production of protein from an mRNA can be controlled. It is very important in eggs and has also been detected in the brain. However it is not clear whether it plays a role in any other types of cells. We have recently shown that cytoplasmic polyadenylation also occurs when fibroblasts attach to a new surface. Fibroblasts are skin cells and their attachement contributes to skin healing. Fibroblasts are much less specialised than eggs or brain cells, indicating that regulation by cytoplasmic polyadenylation may be a general phenomenon. We are now planning to investigate how widespread cytoplasmic polyadenylation is in fibroblasts and what proteins are required for this process. The data gathered in this project will ultimately have relevance for many medical problems, such as wound healing and the spreading of cancer cells through the body.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/G001847/1","grantId":"BB/G001847/1","fundValue":"528671","fundStart":"2008-12-01","fundEnd":"2011-11-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Our work on the polyadenylation inhibitor cordycepin elicits a lot of interest from the wider public because it is derived from the parasitic cordyceps fungi, which are famous in Chinese medicine and even have given rise to a game based on a hypothetical Cordyceps species that infects humans (The Last of Us). Consequently, press releases based on our papers (Wong et al, 2010 and Kondrashov et al, 2012) were picked up by the press world wide and led to appearances in radio interviews (Dutch national radio, BBC Nottingham), newspaper and magazine articles (eg Metro, National Geographic website) and TV programmes (French TV5, BBC documentary &amp;amp;amp;quot;The Magic of Mushrooms&amp;amp;amp;quot;). I am regularly contacted by the public and by medical doctors asking me about the potential benefits and dangers of consuming Cordyceps. \n\nIn addition, our growing expertise on the analysis of poly(A) tails has led to a number of requests for help from other laboratories in the world who have found that poly(A) tails appear to play a role in their investigations. Laboratories we've been helping include that of Prof. Carla Green (Texas, USA), working on circadian rythm, and Prof. Michael Lenhard (formerly John Innes Centre, now Potsdam, Germany), working on plant development. Their work is likely to have impacts on healthcare and agriculture.

This tail helps with the translation of messenger RNAs into proteins and protects it from degradation. Because the adenosine residues are taken off over time, the poly(A) tail length is thought to be a function of the age of an mRNA and determine how long it will produce protein. In this project we have studied polyadenylation and the polyadenyation inhibiting compound cordycepin. \nCordycepin is derived from the famous caterpillar fungi that are highly prized in traditional Chinese and Tibetan medicine. Our studies indicate that cordycepin acts on cell proliferation, adhesion and protein synthesis and may therefore potentially be a cancer drug. In addition we have shown that cordycepin inhibits inflammation, the reaction that causes pain, redness and swelling in response to injury or infection. The effect of cordycepin on the genes that cause inflammation was shown to be mediated through inhibition of polyadenylation. Our findings therefore indicate that cordycepin could also be an anti-inflammatory drug and works via a novel mechanism, distinct from corticosteroid drugs and non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin. \nWe examined the effect of the poly(A) tail on mRNA accumulation and found that the presence of a poly(A) tail leads to more rapid regulation of genes. Remarkably, many mRNAs were found not to obtain a tail of 200 adenosine residues, as has been written in textbooks for the past 30 years, but instead different mRNAs receive poly(A) tails of different lengths, which has effects on how long these mRNAs live and how they are degraded. Many of the genes that we have found to be sensitive to cordycepin are very rapidly regulated and are predicted to be very dependent on polyadenylation, which may explain its specific effects on cell growth and inflammation. My work is already contributing to the development of cordycepin and/or cordycepin analogues as cancer therapy and/or anti-inflammatory drugs. We are currently working on collaborations with researchers that investigate these conditions in animals to test cordycepin as a medicine.
