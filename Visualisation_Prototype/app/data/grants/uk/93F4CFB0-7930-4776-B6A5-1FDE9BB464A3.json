It complements a concrete proposal for the University of Bristol (UoB) to be recognised as an ACE-CSR. The long term goal is to coordinate existing world-class research (including, for example, cryptography and quantum key distribution, digital forensics and computer virus/malware analysis) under a UoB-wide research centre termed the Bristol Security Centre (BSC); the BSC will, for example, capitalise on internal research synergies, deliver training cyber security, and foster strategic links between research groups and various \nexternal stakeholders (including but not limited to CESG, EPSRC, other ACE-CSRs, and industrial partners).\n\nIn short, the proposal outlines various activities that require modest funding (by EPSRC) for said ACE-CSR to fully engage with the scheme and meet the goals outlined above (and expanded upon the case for support).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K000675/1","grantId":"EP/K000675/1","fundValue":"47775","fundStart":"2012-08-20","fundEnd":"2017-08-19","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Daniel  Page","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":" This grant funds no research.
