Through its long-term and deep engagement with migrant communities in eight locations: two cities (Glasgow and Aberdeen) two medium-sized towns (Peterhead and Arbroath) and four more remote rural locations in Aberdeenshire and Angus, the project will deliver significant new and original empirical data. It will generate important new academic insight through its innovative synthesis of existing theoretical frameworks. Moreover, the project proposes to develop practical and policy outcomes and solutions through the use of participatory action research. A first phase of in-depth qualitative research will identify key themes and areas of concern, drawing particularly on migrantsâ€™ own experiences and perspectives. This will be followed by the phase of participatory action research, during which the project team will work directly with migrants, migrant organisations, policymakers, service providers and employers to develop practical projects addressing particular issues. The process of developing these projects will be evaluated as will their short, medium and long-term outcomes with a view to determining 'best practice' and the potential for replication in broader local, regional and national contexts.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J007374/1","grantId":"ES/J007374/1","fundValue":"906718","fundStart":"2013-11-04","fundEnd":"2017-11-03","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Rebecca Lisa Kay","coPersons":["Moya  Flynn","Sergei  Shubin"],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
