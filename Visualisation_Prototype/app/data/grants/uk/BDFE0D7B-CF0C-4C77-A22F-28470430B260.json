The Franco dictatorship (1939-1975) was a bleak time for Catalan theatre, with severe restrictions placed on the content of plays and on the use of the Catalan language. One effect of this repression was the rise of Catalan performance groups, who often substituted mime and gesture for words. The performance groups thrived in the late Franco period, and beyond that into the new democratic era. A number of them, including Els Joglars, La Fura dels Baus and La Cubana, acquired an international reputation, performing beyond Catalonia and Spain. The rise of the performance groups was paralleled by the demise of text-based theatre in Catalonia in the 1970s and the early 1980s. A whole generation of playwrights who had worked mainly in the realist tradition during the Franco era, battling against censorship and the lack of a theatre infrastructure, were marginalized in the early years of the new democracy, this time not by the state apparatus but simply because theatre was now perceived more as a collective act rather than the work of an individual writer. This changed in the mid 1980s, as text-based theatre came once more to the fore. Playwrights such as Bernard-Marie Kolt&egrave;s, Heiner M&uuml;ller and David Mamet had an impact not only in their own countries but also in Catalonia. In Barcelona, the pioneering workshops of the Valencian-born writer and pedagogue Jos&eacute; Sanchis Sinisterra, founder of the Teatro Fronterizo which was later housed in the Sala Beckett, helped form a new generation of young playwrights. One of the beneficiaries of Sanchis's pioneering work was Sergi Belbel (b. 1963), the subject of my project.\\nBelbel's reputation is high not only in Barcelona but also in the rest of Spain, France, Germany and Scandinavia. Belbel's plays mark a radical departure from the realism that dominated Catalan playwriting durithe Franco period. He is a major figure both as playwright and director, and has influenced both the older generation of Catalan playwrights and his contemporaries and younger writers. Although he has been perceived as an apolitical author, this does not mean that his plays do not tackle controversial contemporary issues. Indeed, a number of those her has written since the early 1990s have dealt with two burning questions not only in Barcelona and Spain but worldwide: terrorism and immigration. He has also co-authored a Catalan television soap, and a number of his plays have been adapted to the cinema by Catalan filmmaker Ventura Pons.\\nAlthough Belbel continues to be active as a playwright, a greater percentage of his time is now taken up with directing, in both Catalan and Spanish, while, in July 2006, he took over as Director of the Teatre Nacional de Catalunya (TNC). As with his dramaturgy, his choice of play to direct is eclectic, including his own work, plays by other Catalan dramatists, and foreign drama, which in some cases he himself has translated. He has a particular admiration for Bernard-Marie Kolt&egrave;s, and has translated and directed a number of his plays.\\nThe project for which I am seeking AHRC funding will involve the exploration of Belbel's achievements as a playwright, director, and Director of the TNC. I will assess the reception of his plays and productions, both inside and outside Catalonia, through an analysis of press reviews. I will evaluate the extent to which the productions / and their success or otherwise / may have been influenced by the theatre spaces in which they have been performed, and by the specific directors (of Belbel's own plays), actors, stage designers and musicians who have been responsible for their production.\\n\\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/F01337X/1","grantId":"AH/F01337X/1","fundValue":"32234","fundStart":"2009-01-26","fundEnd":"2009-05-25","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"David  George","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Swansea University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
