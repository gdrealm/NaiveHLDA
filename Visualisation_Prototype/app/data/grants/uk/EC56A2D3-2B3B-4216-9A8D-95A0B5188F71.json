NGS technologies can determine complete viral genomes with a resolution allowing the quantification of RNA quasispecies variation within samples and can economize the sequencing of large numbers of samples or larger DNA virus genomes. Focusing on important epizootic viral diseases that threaten livestock industries in Europe, the aim of this project is to exploit NGS to generate improved tools that can be used in real-time during epidemics. This work will be undertaken by a multidisciplinary team of scientists from Belgium, Germany, Italy, Sweden, and the United Kingdom with expertise in molecular virology, bioinformatics, mathematical modeling, and evolutionary biology. RNA viruses evolve rapidly and quickly adapt to different environmental pressures escaping host immune defenses, altering their pathogenicity and host range, and evading diagnostic tests. Current methodologies limit the resolution at which we can study the evolutionary dynamics of the complex genomic mixtures (quasispecies) that are typical for these viruses. Archived sample collections representing epizootic outbreaks of pathogens such as foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), avian influenza virus (AIV), Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV) and classical swine fever virus (CSFV) will be used to monitor the evolution during field outbreaks of disease. Spatiotemporal data collected in the field will be integrated with this genetic data to produce robust models that can be used to reconstruct transmission trees during viral epidemics. Furthermore, in vitro experiments will be performed using FMDV (ss+RNA genome) and AIV (ss segmented-RNA genome) under strong selection pressures. Modeling of the resulting NGS data will provide a framework to describe the wider scale evolutionary patterns that are measured during these field outbreaks. Linking genetic data to viral phenotype will be undertaken by studying DNA viruses with large genomes (ASFV and poxviruses). Although the viruses have relatively stable genomes, their large size poses challenges for sequencing using traditional Sanger approaches. Specific work packages will focus on the improvement and dissemination of technical protocols and on data analysis and dissemination of bioinformatics and modeling tools. Insights from this project will result in: a) Novel information on viral evolution and (sub)populations; b) comparative evolutionary data between viruses with different genome organisation (+ vs. - sense RNA, segmented RNA, c) Improved diagnostic assays, based on an improved recognition of suitable sequence motifs; d) Powerful tools for molecular epidemiology; e) Enhanced capacity to optimize the strain composition of vaccines, and match to emerging virus variants; f) More effective tools to control epidemic and endemic infectious diseases.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/K004492/1","grantId":"BB/K004492/1","fundValue":"432404","fundStart":"2012-11-30","fundEnd":"2016-02-29","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  This project has appled next generation sequencing technologies to address two ubiquitous challenges:\n\n[1] How to sequence large collections of viruses to parameterize improved models that describe viral transmission and outbreak epidemiology. \n[2] How to conduct deep re-sequencing of viral sequences within single samples to define the evolutionary dynamics of viruses.

Previous sequencing protocols have been subject to biases such as those encountered during PCR amplification and cell culture, or are restricted by the need for large quantities of starting material. We have generated a simple and robust methodology for the generation of whole genome sequences on the Illumina MiSeq. This protocol is specific for foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) or other polyadenylated RNA viruses and circumvents both the use of PCR and the requirement for large amounts of initial template. This protocol is currently beng applied to sequence FMD viruses recovered from the epidemic in 2001 that occured in the UK. This project aims to exploit next-generation sequencing methods to generate improved tools that can be used during epidemics of viral diseases threatening livestock industries in Europe. A multidisciplinary team with expertise in molecular virology, bioinformatics, modelling, and evolutionary biology is validating analytical pipelines for sample preparation, data generation and sequence analysis. The project focusses on important RNA viruses that cause sporadic epidemics in\nEurope (FMDV, AIV, NDV), or are endemic in wildlife populations in some EU member states (CSFV), as well as DNA viruses that pose a threat to the EU (ASFV and poxviruses). The project will produce high-resolution sequence data from sample collections held in partner laboratory archives, as well as undertake new in vitro experiments to test specific selection pressures that influence viral evolution. These integrative studies encompassing this spectrum of epidemiology will stimulate the development of innovative tools and provide broad insights into the comparative evolutionary ecology and epidemiology of viruses of human and veterinary importance. These tools are being disseminated to a wider audience (via workshops, communications and publications) and have broad generic application to many other virial diseases.
