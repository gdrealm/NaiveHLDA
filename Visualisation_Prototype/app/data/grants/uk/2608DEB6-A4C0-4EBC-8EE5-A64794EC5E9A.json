{"id":"2608DEB6-A4C0-4EBC-8EE5-A64794EC5E9A","title":"Targeted proteinase inhibitors in the study of antigen processing","abstractText":"Vertebrates respond to infections with viruses, bacteria or other microorganisms by very specific immunological responses, which act to prevent the invading organisms from multiplying and causing disease. These responses are the basis on which all vaccines work. The responses are carried out by cells called lymphocytes, which represent about 20% of all white blood cells. The most well known type of lymphocyte are called B cells and make antibody, molecules which attach tightly to the surface of individual viral or bacterial components, and stop them working, or target them for destruction by phagocytes. Another type of lymphocyte, however, the CD4 T lymphocyte, is also essential for most immune responses, because of its role in organising the co-operation between different white blood cells. The vital importance of this cell type has been highlighted by AIDS, a disease in which HIV virus leads to the destruction of the CD4 lymphocyte, leaving the body susceptible to all sorts of infections. CD4 T lymphocytes are able to recognise a bewildering number of different infections. However, their recognition system is such that it can only recognise pieces of viral or bacterial proteins if the proteins are first cut up into small sections by enzymes called proteinases. The aim of this study is to find out which type of proteinase is important in this process, and how inhibiting their activity may be used to change the immunological response. For this purpose, we will use chemicals which are known to inhibit various types of proteinases (inhibitors) and test them on various immunological responses, including the immune response to the parasite malaria. The inhibitors we have available work well with isolated proteinases, but they are often insoluble in water or blood and not good at reaching the right cells of the immune system or penetrating into the right cellular compartment. We will therefore make better versions of these inhibitors, by attaching them to larger 'carrier' molecules which will be able to carry them efficiently and selectively to the right cell within the body. The results of these studies will add to our understanding of how the immune system works, and thus ultimately help to develop better ways to prevent infection.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D005469/1","grantId":"BB/D005469/1","fundValue":"662544","fundStart":"2006-04-24","fundEnd":"2010-04-23","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Benny  Chain","coPersons":["Alethea  Tabor"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":" 1. Targeted delivery of an aspartic proteinase inhibitor pepstatin to the antigen processing compartment of dendritic cells , resulting in selective block of processing and presentation of ovalbumin and malaria epitopes in vitro. Validated by functional antigen processing assays. (Objectives 1 and 10). In parallel demonstrated that aspartic proteinases were not absolutely required for invariant chain processing in dendritic cells. \n\n2. Targeted delivery of pepstatin to the endocytic pathway of dendritic cells and macrophages cells in vitro and in vivo, via mannose binding receptor. Validated by confocal microscopy and flow cytometry. (Objective 4 and 5). In particular, BSA-mannose-pepstatin conjugates showed selective access to macrophages and dendritic cells at sites of inflammation. \n\n3. Demonstrate that the basic synthetic strategy can be used as a generic delivery system of inhibitors to dendritic cells and macrophages, by synthesis of a new set of targeted cathepsin S inhibitors using similar strategy. (Objective 6) The strategy of targeting small molecules to macrophages via targeting to sugars is of general application to inflammation research Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
