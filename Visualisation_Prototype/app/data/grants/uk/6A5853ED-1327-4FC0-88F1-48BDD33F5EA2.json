{"id":"6A5853ED-1327-4FC0-88F1-48BDD33F5EA2","title":"Microwave filters with improved power handling capabilities for satellite applications","abstractText":"Multipactor is a resonant electron phenomena where secondary electrons are emitted due to primary electrons hitting the RF surface. The secondary electrons then interact with the RF field to return to the structure creating more secondary electrons. The number of electrons growths with time until the RF signal is distorted or damage occurs. Multipactor is a major limiting factor in both satellite communications equipment and particle accelerators due to the high power and vacuum required in both applications. At present multipactor is dealt with in the satellite industry by providing huge safety margins in RF design. Better understanding of multipactor could result is smaller margins and hence a significantly reduced cost. The satellite communications industry is worth several billion pounds.\n\nRecent studies of multipactor in the context of accelerators has led to accurate computational tools for estimating and controlling multipactor. This project aims to apply these new computational tools and technique to the modelling of satellite communications equipment and to benchmark them against experimental measurements of existing components. These tools will them be used to optimise satellite communications equipment with a higher power handling.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/N00230X/1","grantId":"ST/N00230X/1","fundValue":"110050","fundStart":"2016-01-05","fundEnd":"2017-01-04","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Christopher  Lingwood","coPersons":["Graeme  Burt","George  Goussetis"],"organisation":"Lancaster University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
