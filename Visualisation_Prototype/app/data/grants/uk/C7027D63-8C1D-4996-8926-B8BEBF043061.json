The analyses will be conducted in two stages. The main aim of the first stage is estimation of net differences in the immigrant/non-immigrants attainment gap between the 20 countries included in the analyses, and hence the relevance of including effects at the macro-level. This stage will be completed by means of the OLS regression analysis. On the second stage the hierarchical multilevel modelling will be employed in order to capture the effects of both individual and institutional characteristics on the educational performance gap between the immigrants and non-immigrant students. <br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-3351","grantId":"RES-000-22-3351","fundValue":"78272","fundStart":"2009-03-01","fundEnd":"2010-05-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Marina  Shapira","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
