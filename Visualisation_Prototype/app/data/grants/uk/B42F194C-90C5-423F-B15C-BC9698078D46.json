Equally important is the need to reveal the complex thematic patterns of his oeuvre, beyond the limiting clich&eacute; of the femme fatale. The project will thus increase our understanding of both Moreau and French history painting in the second half of the nineteenth century.Despite an ever-increasing scholarly interest in Moreau, coinciding with a new interest in nineteenth-century Salon painting and history painting, the fin-de-si&egrave;cle myth of Moreau as a 'Decadent' or 'Symbolist' artist still prevails. Building on my iconographical study of Les Pr&eacute;tendants (1996) and my book Gustave Moreau et les arts jumeaux (2003), the present project will complete a series of articles on Moreau's paintings and is preparatory work for a large-scale project on nineteenth-century French history painting.Through close analysis of Les Pr&eacute;tendants (c.1860), Orph&eacute;e (Salon of 1866) and Salom&eacute; (Salon of 1876), the first part of the project will shall show how Moreau forged his own brand of spiritualist (but not overtly Catholic) history painting by systematically subverting the academic codes of theatricality, historicism, legibility and compositional hierarchy and by exploiting unorthodox, archaic and exotic stylistic models. It will present Moreau as a militant artist, sympathetic to Ultramontain Catholicism, who engaged with political and moral issues of his time and with the art of his contemporaries. In the second part of the projee unfinished composition Les Lyres mortes (1896-1898), Moreau's last great project, will be used as a focal point for examining thematic patterns in his oeuvre as a whole, especially in relation to sensual representations of Greek mythology and to the autobiographical figure of the Poet. Les Lyres mortes will be interpreted as a palinode in which Moreau vehemently abjures his lifelong faith in Greek mythological inspiration and in the figure of the pagan Poet in favour of an austere, renunciant Christianity.Aims and objectives:The aims are to cast new light on the iconography, themes and pictorial language of key works by Moreau in the contexts of Moreau's oeuvre as a whole and of French history painting in the second half of the nineteenth century.The objectives are to demolish the fin-de-si&egrave;cle myths propagated by Huysmans's novel A rebours (1884) and by other writers; to change the perception of Moreau as a spiritualist history painter and to clarify his personal contribution to history painting; to further define the aesthetic and intellectual contexts in which he operated, and to reveal hitherto unperceived thematic patterns and developments in his oeuvre. Potential applications and benefits:The project will be of interest to art historians and students of French visual culture, especially in the domains of Moreau studies, fin-de-si&egrave;cle studies and history painting. It will contribute to Moreau studies by changing perception of Moreau's work and thereby opening up new avenues for exploration. It will help move interest away from the stale and limiting notion of Moreau as a hothouse Decadent and encourage researchers to explore further his engagement with the traditions and practices of history painting. At the same time, it will enrich understanding of French history painting in the second half of the nineteenth century, thereby encouraging further interest in this under-studied field.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/D000416/1","grantId":"AH/D000416/1","fundValue":"25352","fundStart":"2006-09-18","fundEnd":"2007-01-17","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter David Cooke","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":" I have developed knowledge and understanding of:\n\n- Gustave Moreau's contribution to the development of history painting in the 1860s and 1870s\n- Moreau's iconography (i.e. the signifying content of his art)\n- Moreau's interaction with the art of his time, especially with contemporary history painting\n- the interplay of politics, style and iconography in Moreau's art, especially in Salome (1876)\n- the interplay of spiritual aspirations and sexual desire in his painting, especially in Les Lyres mortes (1896-1898)\n- the development of religion and mythology in Moreau's iconography.
