In addition to this application, inkjet printing is a versatile manufacturing tool with a range of applications ranging from the industrial printing of barcodes and security marking to low cost printed electronics, solar cells and biosensors. It is also a long established method for 3D printing of polymers and ceramics. Inkjet printing is a digital technology, enabling designs and structures to be fabricated directly from files stored on a computer without the need to produce intermediate moulds, tools or screens. Thus a great attraction of using inkjet printing in these newer manufacturing applications is its potential to dramatically reduce lead times from concept to manufacture. This proposal is to provide a central facility to enable research in all of these applications for inkjet printing and in particular to enable us to translate this research from the laboratory to applications in industry and medicine that will be of direct benefit to the UK.\n\nThe suite of inkjet printers will allow a number of projects to be carried out including:\n Printing functional materials and structures on textiles to allow smart clothing that could monitor the health of an individual.\n Printing radio frequency identification devices (RFID) &quot;invisible bar codes&quot; on products to improve security and allow automatic checkout in stores.\n Improve our fundamental understanding of the science of how inkjet drops are formed and how they interact with surfaces after printing.\n Develop new inks that allow the printing of new materials e.g. graphene.\n Enable the 3D printing of structures that can be implanted into the body to enable the healing and regeneration of tissues.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/L012022/1","grantId":"EP/L012022/1","fundValue":"186721","fundStart":"2013-11-20","fundEnd":"2016-05-18","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Brian  Derby","coPersons":["Colin Gareth  Bailey","Stephen George Yeates"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
