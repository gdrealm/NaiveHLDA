The details of these visits are given below, with outputs.\nThere is no doubt that India will become a major power in research on crop improvement, and in particular in the application of genomics and other advanced approaches. The importance of wheat as a major crop in the UK and India will therefore provide unique opportunities to develop long term collaborations and partnerships, but these will depend on financial and personal commitments from both sides. The visit was the first step in enabling us to develop such partnerships, but identifying relevant partners and introducing ourselves and our research to them.\nPossible collaborations established with: NIPGR; TERI; ICAR; IARI; NRCPB; Meerut; Chaudhary Charan Singh (CCS) University (formerly Meerut University); Karnal, DWR; Hyderabad ICRISAT; CRIDA  Agriculture/ Food and Drink,Environment,Manufacturing/ including Industrial Biotechology","dataset":"gtr"}
