In recent years there has been a dramatic increase in life threatening invasive fungal infections. Most of the common treatments have been rendered useless by the emergence of multidrug resistance in fungal pathogens. One of the few remaining reliable drugs is amphotericin B, that is active against most fungal strains and because resistance has not emerged as a problem even after over forty years of clinical use. However, this antibiotic has dangerous side effects that limit its use. Many attempts have been made to generate analogues of amphotericin B that retain antifungal activity with much diminished human toxicity. The structural complexity of amphotericin has made conventional chemical derivatisation very difficult, yet several useful analogues have been generated, but the expense of their chemical preparation renders them impractical for clinical use. However, their existence demonstrates that analogues with improved therapeutic potential do exist. In Leicester, we have studied Nature's 'molecular architecture' to find out how these intricate molecules are assembled from very small building blocks. We now know what 'bricks and mortar' are used, and the order in which they are put together, to obtain the final product. Recent advances in molecular biology now enables the exploitation of this understanding to produce a wide range of analogues. Dr Caffrey in Dublin has generated a series of mutants (a bit is missing from the DNA blueprint) that no longer produce amphotericin B. One mutant produces amphotericin lacking in a hydroxyl group. Another mutant produces the core part of the molecule, but no longer has a sugar unit attached to its side. A third set of mutants have several bits missing. We will examine all these mutants to determine the actual structures produced, and the effect of these omissions on antifungal astivity. We will generate a mutant that not only is missing the sugar unit, but has the DNA blueprint added, that will add to our molecule, a different sugar unit. The long term aim of this research is to generate commercially viable biologically produced analogues of amphotericin B that, retain its antifungal activity with much reduced human toxicity, this will save lives.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D017270/1","grantId":"BB/D017270/1","fundValue":"368321","fundStart":"2006-09-01","fundEnd":"2009-08-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Bernard James Rawlings","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Leicester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
