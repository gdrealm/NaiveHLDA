{"id":"CB92C67A-45A4-432D-89F1-C26DA1749756","title":"Applying computational semantics","abstractText":"This project is a collaboration between researchers who are interested in automatically extracting meaning representations from text. We are specifically interested in the problem of capturing those aspects of meaning which can be deduced from syntactic and morphological information. Many researchers are sharing work on semantic representation: however, it is necessary to improve the utility of this work for application developers. We will approach this by developing new techniques and objectives for collaborative development of semantic analyses. This project involves several international research groups, and the collaboration includes multilingual work.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F012950/1","grantId":"EP/F012950/1","fundValue":"57713","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2008-06-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Ann  Copestake","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
