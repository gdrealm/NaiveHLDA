{"id":"409C2975-219D-41C2-BE6A-72A84DFA2F76","title":"Exploration of the hydrogen storage capacity of pillared nanographite intercalates","abstractText":"This project is a feasibility study aimed at establishing the viability of a new class of material for hydrogen storage namely pillared nanographites. One of the more challenging problems in energy research is to find a compact, safe and lightweight alternative to petroleum that has similar energy densities. There are a large number of different potential solutions to this problem, but the use of hydrogen has interesting possibilities in that it promises a clean, efficient and quiet form of energy storage. We believe that we have identified a new class of materials, pillared nanographites, that will be able to satisfy this need and are also cheap and environmentally friendly (recyclable). The hydrogen absorption properties of these materials are highly tuneable via control of the interlayer spacing, the concentration and type of intercalant, the surface charge, and nano-scale texture. Furthermore, our compounds are cheap, recyclable and environmentally friendly (they do not contain toxic heavy metals). We would therefore like to request funds for an exploratory study that will establish the feasibility or otherwise of these materials. Although it is quite speculative in nature, this project has strong support from Toyota Motors.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F027923/1","grantId":"EP/F027923/1","fundValue":"204744","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The findings of this research have improved our understanding of hydrogen storage materials based on physisorption of molecular hydrogen. specifically, 2-dimensional layered materials based on graphite.

In this project we looked at materials that might act as a reversible store of hydrogen. The materials we looked at are based on graphite (carbon) and showed promise for this application and are currently under further investigation. The papers have been widely cited by others in the field, in addition the project led to the formation of Cella Energy - a spinout company. Chemicals,Energy,Transport","dataset":"gtr"}
