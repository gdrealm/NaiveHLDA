Today entire DNA genomes are being sequenced, bringing with them the prospect of a revolution in medicine and biology. Similarly, a new protein can have its polypeptide sequence read, with the result that the molecular detail of its structure can be determined and the detailed mechanism of its biological function revealed. The situation is very different for the third major class of biopolymers, the glycans (sugar-containing molecules - polysaccharides and glycosylated polymers in general), despite increasing recognition of their critical role in the biology of all life and their industrial importance. On the one hand, specific short sequences may be defined with submolecular precision, but on the other, beyond a dozen or so monomers the relationship between these sequences is lost and we must rely on bulk methods to describe the material. This often leaves those who wish to understand the multiple, critical roles played by polysaccharides with little of the molecular scale detail now taken for granted by molecular biologists. Examples of these beneficiaries include the food and pharmaceutical industries looking to develop new food and drug delivery formulations, medical researchers hoping to appreciate the role of glycopolymers in human health, or botanists and microbiologists studying the function of plant and bacterial cell walls in growth or pathogenic activity. This project exploits the recent development of a force-measuring microscope capable of, for the first time, mapping the distribution of defined oligomer (short polymer) sequences in single glycan polymers. It will do this by exploiting the phenomenon of rotaxanes - molecular rings threaded over a polymer chain. In this case, an atomic force microscope (AFM) probe picks up the ring (a cyclodextrin molecule) from its 'base' on a suitable polymer and slides it along and on to the glycan chain of interest, which is coupled to the rotaxane. Molecules known to recognise and bind to well-defined sequences within the polymer are allowed to interact with the polymer chain and form complexes; the ring is then passed along the chain and when it encounters a complex will 'unzip' it, removing the bound molecule. The mapping information comes from the magnitude of the interaction between the ring and each bound complex it encounters, along with the position along the chain at which the interaction occurs. By collecting this information from a large sample of individual polymers, a map of the distribution patterns of the known sequences is revealed. We have shown that this appealingly simple mechanical concept actually works for simple model polymers; now this project is designed to apply this entirely new sequencing tool to a medically and commercially highly significant glycan, alginate. Alginate is produced by seaweeds and also by bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa when it colonises the lung in cases of cystic fibrosis. Alginate produced by the bacteria in the lung forms a gel to protect the bacteria from immune responses and attacks but also contributes to obstructions in the airways of the lung which may be fatal. Median life expectancy of cystic fibrosis sufferers is 35 years. Alginate gels form in the presence of calcium and other divalent cations due to the formation of so-called 'egg box' junction zones between aligned pairs of guluronic acid (oligoG) sequences. The minimum length of oligoG required to form a stable junction zone is not known and thus this project aims to determine both this minimum length and its distribution within well-characterised samples of alginate polymers.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/H019294/1","grantId":"BB/H019294/1","fundValue":"320372","fundStart":"2010-10-08","fundEnd":"2013-10-07","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Application to UEA 'proof of concept' fund for the development of ideas for commercial exploitation.

In this project we are seeking to implement an Atomic Force Microscope (AFM)-based method for mapping the occurrence of so-called 'junction zones' (regions where two polymer strands are crosslinked by the presence of metal ions) in the commercially important polysaccharide alginate as a first step towards single molecule polysaccharide sequencing. Well-characterised oligomers of known size and composition have been provided to us by our collaborators at NTNU, Trondheim, Norway (work package A1). In order to perform the mapping experiments, we had to develop ways to attach the polymer to a short rotaxane (a complex of a suitable polymer strand threaded through a molecular ring molecule, in this case polyethylene oxide (PEO) is the polymer and cyclodextrin is the ring molecule). Our first finding is the establishment of a reproducible chemical method for the conjugation of alginates to PEO (work package A2). Our next goal was to characterise a strong linkage between an AFM probe and a polymer tether attached to the cyclodextrin ring. We have succeeded in implementing such a linkage in AFM experiments using the bond between a succinimide group on the AFM probe and an amine group at the end of the polymer tether (work package A3). The final step of this work package was to develop a method to routinely immobilise the rotaxane-alginate conjugate at a surface, and we have succeeded in this goal by making thiol-terminated surfaces and using maleimide groups at the end of the PEO part of the rotaxane (work package A4).\n\nThe second phase of the project involved characterising the interactions of the conjugates we have made, in order to understand what happens when junction zones are formed. Originally we had planned to use labview to independently control the AFM to accomplish this task. However, a new AFM was made available for this project which had the necessary control software built in, so the objective of work package B1 was achieved in this way. We have used this system to determine the rupture force profiles, and work of adhesion profiles, for the interactions of different size blocks of oligoguluronate ('G-blocks') and oligomannuronate ('M-blocks') in the presence of calcium, strontium and barium. We find strong interactions between G-blocks of various sizes, but find a step-change in the work profile when the size of the G-block changes from 7 to 9. This finding strongly suggests that a G-block longer than 8 is required to form the junction zones responsible for the properties of alginate gels (work package B2). Finally, work package B3 required us to use AFM to pick up the cyclodextrin ring threaded over the PEO, slide it on to the alginate molecule and 'unzip' a G-block forming a junction zone with a sequence of G-block within the alginate. We have succeeded in observing the unzipping of G-blocks from alginate, and are currently working to characterise the interaction and use it to produce a map of a large alginate polymer (work package B3). In addition to these original aims we have identified some key parameters that determine the magnitude of the force required to slide a macrocycle over a particular monomer. This set of parameters may be used to identify which polymers will be amenable to mapping using this technique, beyond the scope of the originally envisaged materials. Alginate is used commercially in a variety of applications, most of which rely on the gelling properties we have been characterising. Understanding the detailed sequence requirements for strong gels will be useful to manufacturers and refiners of alginates for commercial applications. At least 2 publications are in preparation describing our key findings for work package B2. These results will be brought to the attention of commercial users of alginate through publication and presentation at conferences. A further significant publication will follow our successful realisation of work package B3.\n\n\n\nWhile fulfilling the objective of work package A2, we developed a novel way to ensure that we could identify whether we had picked up only one molecule with our AFM probe. Our method would be easy to implement and would very easily and quickly provide information about how many molecules had been picked up in each experiment. Current methods for determining this are either limited or difficult to implement, so a rapid and easily implemented method would be useful to academic researchers performing single molecule experiments. We are currently seeking to develop this method for commercial exploitation, taking advantage of the routes to commercialisation provided by UEA's Research and Enterprise Services.
