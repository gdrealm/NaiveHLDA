This seminar series will stimulate discussion and knowledge sharing between disabled parents, disability and/or parenting organisations, academics, practitioners, and policy makers (at local and national levels). In particular the series emphasises the role of disabled parents in developing and conducting research, and in the development of networks locally and nationally which can enable people with different interests and expertise to develop ways of working together and ensure space for debate. </p>\n\n<p>Each seminar day will include time during which local and national developments are highlighted and shared, and discussion can take place on ways in which disabled parents are or can be involved in driving the research agenda. </p>\n\n<p>Each seminar day will also include presentations concerning specific topics, which are likely to include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>Disabled parents and the new children’s services landscape;<br /></li>\n\n <li>Disabled parents in the adoption and fostering system;<br /></li>\n\n <li>Disabled parents and poverty;<br /></li>\n\n <li>Disabled parents, transport and housing;<br /></li>\n\n <li>Disabled parents and disabled children;<br /></li>\n\n <li>Disabled parents and gender roles.</li>\n</ul>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-451-25-4024","grantId":"RES-451-25-4024","fundValue":"2230","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2009-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"R  OlsenHarriet Elena Clarke","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
