{"id":"CB46D876-23EE-4414-B233-7ECB0D3C08D1","title":"Building Bodies and making them work!","abstractText":"<p>This is a series of interactive experiments and demonstrations held as part of Cambridge Science Week - on 17 March in the Cambridge Department of Physiology, Development and Neuroscience.</p>\n\n<p>The mammalian body is the most complex entity we have encountered in nature. Indeed, it almost defies belief that such a thing forms itself from a single fertilised egg, maintains its own existence in the face of adversity, and coordinates sensation, thought and movement. The event will allow our experts in developmental biology, anatomy, physiology and neuroscience to show you how a human body manages to do all this. We will show you how embryos are patterned and finished and how those ‘finished’ structures are woven together in the body. Participants can study the pounding of their own hearts, and the rise and fall of their own breathing. They will measure impulses conducted through their own nerves and examine the amazing sensitivity of their own senses.</p>\n\n<p>The events will be accessible to all members of the public from 3 to 99 years old. Previous experience of smaller events has been that approximately 400 people attend, so we expect more this year!</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-168-26-0091","grantId":"RES-168-26-0091","fundValue":"1506","fundStart":"2007-03-01","fundEnd":"2007-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"William  Harris","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
