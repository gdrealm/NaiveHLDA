This shift requires a rethink of how effectiveness and improvement have been understood by the field, and constructed by policy makers and practitioners.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;The aim of the series is to explore two key issues:</p>\n\n<ol>\n \n\n <li>attention must be given to promoting equity as well as effectiveness. In recent times, the quasi-market has often meant one school or student's gain is another's loss and that patterns of effectiveness have tended to mirror social inequities</li>\n\n <li>the field must develop new methodologies if a) inequities are to be challenged and, b) if a broader set of outcome measures are to be developed. </li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>Therefore the findings from this series will address two overarching questions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>How can educational effectiveness and improvement research and practice support the development of a more equitable education service?</li>\n\n <li>What are the key indicators of educational effectiveness and improvement and what are the new methodologies required to facilitate a shift from 'school' effectiveness and improvement to 'educational' effectiveness and improvement?\n\n  <ul>\n   \n\n   <li>&nbsp;</li>\n\n  </ul>\n</li>\n\n <p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n</ul>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-451-26-0793","grantId":"RES-451-26-0793","fundValue":"15183","fundStart":"2009-11-01","fundEnd":"2010-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Christopher James Chapman","coPersons":["Daniel  Muijs"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
