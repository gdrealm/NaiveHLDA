{"id":"AE4FDC85-00F4-45A4-A3B5-A4C79CC139A0","title":"Home-based Telework in the European Labour Market","abstractText":"<p>The seminar series uniquely focuses on the under researched area of Home-based Telework (HbTW) in the European Labour Market. The challenges to counteract economic downturn in Europe have led organisations to embrace ideas of ‘new’ ways and forms to work. This includes rethinking job design and delivery including evaluating the global location of work. Aims of HbTW incorporate finding value and cost cutting on Europe’s own doorstep.</p>\n\n<p>The seminar series has been organised by researchers from the UK, Netherlands and Sweden. The dimensions of HbTW that this seminar series will explore are the interconnections between Households, Community, Organisation, Management, Policy, Gender, Governance and the Virtual Worker set in the context of the European political economy. Each seminar event will draw on keynote speakers from ‘seasoned’ expert researchers in the field; early career researchers and also researchers, consultants and HbTW practitioners from outside the academy.<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L001268/1","grantId":"ES/L001268/1","fundValue":"14132","fundStart":"2013-12-09","fundEnd":"2016-08-08","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Helen Jane  Richardson","coPersons":["Pascale  Peters","Minna Elina Salminen-Karlsson","Sudi Sedigheh Sharifi","Daiga  Kamerade"],"organisation":"Sheffield Hallam University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
