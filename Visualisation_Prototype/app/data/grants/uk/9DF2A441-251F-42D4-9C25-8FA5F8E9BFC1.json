In mainly behavioural experiments, hybrid designs are employed that combine the Masked Prime paradigm (which taps into low-level control) with high-level control paradigms such as Simon or Go-Nogo tasks. </p>\n\n<p>This makes it possible to study interactions as well as correlations between high- and low-level control effects. By focussing on the motor domain, the project aims to provide a systematic overview of the relationship within and between high-level and low-level control processes. Such information will be useful as a basis for future research into other areas of cognitive inhibition, many of which might at least partly reflect underlying response inhibition processes.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-1841","grantId":"RES-000-22-1841","fundValue":"76869","fundStart":"2006-11-01","fundEnd":"2007-11-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Friederike  Schlaghecken","coPersons":["Elizabeth Ann Maylor"],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
