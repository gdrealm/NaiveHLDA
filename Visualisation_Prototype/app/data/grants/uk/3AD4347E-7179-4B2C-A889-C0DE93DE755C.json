The group of scholars on the project is the strongest team ever to work together on pre-modern Japanese language and significant results of relevance to Japanese studies in general, Japanese linguistics, and historical and general linguistic theory are anticipated.\\n\\nMost research into historical Japanese grammar, including syntax, implicitly assumes the grammatical categories of the modern language and projects them onto earlier stages of the language. This project, by contrast, will investigate pre-modern Japanese on its own merit, providing an immanent, comprehensive account of each of the earlier stages. The project will also give a description of the changes that have taken place between these stages of the language and contribute significantly to an understanding of how the grammar of Japanese has changed through time.\\n\\nOur theoretical focus is on 'argument realization', which is a fundamentally important aspect of the syntax of a language which concerns the way in which verb meaning determines the number of arguments and their morpho-syntactic and semantic properties. This will be investigated in detail through large text corpora, focusing on the following three distinct and well-attested periods of the Japanese language.\\n\\nOld Japanese (mainly 700 - 800)\\nEarly Middle Japanese (800-1200, but especially 900 - 1100)\\nEarly Modern Japanese (c. 1600)\\n\\nThe descriptive and analytical work of the project is based on extensive text corpora from these three periods. The first step in the project is the construction of a large database (for internal use only) which organizes the empirical material for analysis: the texts will first be transcribed and entered into an electronic database and then 'tagged' to show the grammatical role of nouns in the sentences; finally all verbs will be extracted and recorded together with information about the grammatical roles with which they occur, thereby creating an electronic concordance with information about each verb and the grammatical frame in which it can occur.\\n\\nThis database makes possible a comprehensive and systematic analysis and description of verb meaning and associated grammatical frames in each of the stages of Japanese, determining what part of verb meaning contributes most importantly to its grammatical potential and how this potential is realized in sentences. The project will give a detailed analysis of relevant verb classes and of differences and similarities between and across verb classes.\\n\\nBased on this analysis it will further be possible to chart changes for individual verbs and classes of verbs and to establish possible 'developmental pathways' through time for verb meaning and grammatical frames.\\n\\nA detailed investigation of this kind within this theoretical approach has never been carried out for any language. The results of the investigation will first of all bear on the description and understanding of pre-modern Japanese and its changes through time, with implications for interpretation of texts. The study will also have a number of implications for linguistic theory, both with regards to frameworks for understanding verb semantics and clause structure, and with regards to the application of grammatical theory to 'dead' languages.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/F018894/1","grantId":"AH/F018894/1","fundValue":"826715","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-06-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Bjarke  Frellesvig","coPersons":["Peter  Sells"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
