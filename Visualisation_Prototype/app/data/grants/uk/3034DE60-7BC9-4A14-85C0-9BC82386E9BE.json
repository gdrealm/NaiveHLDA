Malfunctions of the immune system always have serious consequences, and are often fatal (e.g. in cancer, anaphylactic shock and asthma, and autoimmune and infectious diseases). It is also the immune system which rejects an incompatible transplanted kidney, for instance, and causes mayhem when a patient is transfused with blood of the wrong group. Yet it can also be harnessed to mount an attack on cancer cells - a discovery that has led to one of the most momentous recent advances in treatment, the use of monoclonal antibodies - and this is now a subject at the forefront of medical research. The primary agents of the immune system are proteins, called antibodies. Each antibody recognises a particular substance (its antigen), as for example a protein on the surface of a bacterium. There are five classes of antibody in man, each of which acts in a different way or at a different location in the body, but all are made up of similar building blocks. To manipulate the immune system in our favour - to prevent rejection of an organ, or cause it to generate an antibody that will attack a tumour - we need to understand the highly complex programme of steps that controls the process of antibody construction. This mechanism involves rearranging the DNA sequences that encode the antibodies in a process called class switch recombination. What are the signals that instruct the cell to make an antibody of one class and not another? How does that signal set the machinery in operation? Why does it not initiate the activation of genes that will make the wrong protein? Most work in this area has been done on mice, but we have found important differences between the mouse and the human immune systems. We therefore work entirely on human antibody-producing cells. Our aim now is to disentangle the steps in the sequence of events that culminates in the production of an antibody of the required type and no other. We will employ novel methods that we have developed in our previous research to answer these questions. We will analyse the DNA sequences and the proteins that participate in class switch recombination using unique DNA probes and 'next generation' DNA sequencing technology to identify millions of protein and DNA complexes. We will also use ultra-high resolution microscopy to determine when and where in the cell that different steps in the process occur. We hope and expect that what we learn about this system will help in stimulating the formation of antibodies with the properties needed for an attack on different types of disease or suppressing the formation of harmful antibodies.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/H019634/1","grantId":"BB/H019634/1","fundValue":"458250","fundStart":"2010-12-17","fundEnd":"2013-12-16","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"David  Fear","coPersons":["Hannah Jane Gould"],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
