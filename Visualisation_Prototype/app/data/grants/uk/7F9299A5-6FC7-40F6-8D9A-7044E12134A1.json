Closer inspection reveals that each ripple or wave spreads out as it travels and in so doing decreases in height or amplitude until it has all but vanished by the time it reaches the edge of the pond. Remarkably, however, there exists a form of wave that does not spread out or disperse and which can therefore travel great distances without any change in amplitude. Such waves are known as solitons and were first observed as bow-waves produced by narrow boats on a canal in Scotland in 1834. Today solitons are seen in many different physical systems ranging from waves in plasmas to optical pulse propagation in nonlinear media. The latter example now finds important applications in long distance optical fibre communication systems. Common to all these examples is the existence of a nonlinear wave equation governing wave propagation in the system.Dilute gases of alkali atoms are now routinely cooled to within a millionth of a degree of absolute zero using laser light, permitting them to be confined in traps formed due to the interaction of an applied magnetic field with the minute magnetic moment of each atom. Further cooling by evaporation leads to the creation of a new state of matter, known as a Bose-Einstein condensate, in which the quantum mechanical nature of the particles dominates over their classical behaviour. The state of this system is also governed by a nonlinear wave equation in which the nonlinearity results from the atom-atom interactions. Moreover, if the atomic interactions in the system are attractive then the condensate can form a bright matter-wave soliton; a pulse or wave-packet of atoms which, just as for the bow-wave on the canal, does not spread out as it propagates. The objective of this proposal is to investigate the formation and dynamics of such solitons in condensates of rubidium-85 atoms. Collisions between rubidium-85 atoms exhibit a scattering resonance, known as a Feshbach resonance, which permits the precise control of the atomic interactions essential for a systematic investigation of soliton formation. Moreover, the use of optical dipole traps permits the real-time modification of the confinement potential and enables the manipulation of the position and velocity of the solitons for precise collision studies.Just as solitons have found applications in everyday life, the creation of bright matter-wave solitons offers potential future applications in atom interferometry and atom optics. This proposal will assess the feasibility of using matter-wave solitons to investigate the interaction between an atom and a solid surface, as part of the longer-term research goal to construct a tunable matter-wave surface probe . The attractive atom-surface interaction is a fundamental problem in QED and has a long and important theoretical history. It is only relatively recently, however, that this interaction has been measured experimentally. More recently, the high degree of control with which ultracold atoms can be manipulated has lead to several new experimental approaches to probe this interaction. Intimately connected to the measurement of atom-surface interactions is the phenomenon of quantum reflection, whereby a particle is reflected from a potential without reaching a classical turning point as a result of the wave nature of the particle. This proposal aims to demonstrate the quantum reflection of solitons from a solid surface, as a first step towards measuring the atom-surface interaction. The use of well-localized solitons, coupled to the precise control of their velocity, has the potential to take the study of atom-surface interactions to a new level. Such studies are motivated by the possibility that precision measurements of atom-surface interactions may, in the future, set new limits on short range corrections to gravity due to exotic forces beyond the Standard model.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F002068/1","grantId":"EP/F002068/1","fundValue":"563047","fundStart":"2008-01-09","fundEnd":"2012-07-08","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Simon Lee Cornish","coPersons":["Charles Stuart Adams"],"organisation":"Durham University","findingsText":" Bose-Einstein condensates are novel states of matter in which the quantum nature of particles dominates the behaviour of a dilute gas. Such matter is governed by a nonlinear wave equation in which the nonlinearity results from the atom-atom interactions. If the atomic interactions in the system are attractive then the condensate can form a bright matter-wave soliton; a pulse or wave-packet of atoms where the dispersion is exactly balanced by the attractive interaction. The objective of this proposal was to investigate the formation and dynamics of such solitons using rubidium-85 condensates.\n\n\n\nThrough this proposal, we have constructed a reliable and versatile apparatus for the study of ultracold gases of rubidium. The system uses a novel magnetic transport technique to deliver ultracold atoms to a glass science cell, affording unparalleled optical access. The science cell incorporates a super-polished glass prism for the study of atom-surface interactions and we have developed new methods for the controlled delivery of an ultracold atomic gas up to the room-temperature surface of the prism. Utilising high power lasers to optically trap the atomic gas we have produced rubidium-87 condensates containing up to a million atoms. This approach has been extended to rubidium-85, where we have developed a new method to produce Bose-Einstein condensates by direct evaporation in the dipole trap. We are only the third group to realise condensates using this atomic species, and our approach is significantly simpler than the other experiments which employ sympathetic cooling. Collisions between rubidium-85 atoms exhibit a magnetically induced scattering resonance, known as a Feshbach resonance, which permits the precise control of the atomic interactions essential for a systematic investigation of soliton formation. Using this property we have studied the collapse of a condensate following a sudden change in the scattering length from positive to negative. Moreover, through the addition of another laser beam we have transferred the condensate into an optical waveguide and have demonstrated the formation of bright matter-wave solitons. Such solitons travel in the waveguide in a manner very similar to classical particles; something we have demonstrated by the reflection of the soliton from a broad repulsive Gaussian barrier intersecting the waveguide. We have developed simple and robust methods to control the motion of the soliton along the waveguide using simple external magnetic potentials. We are using this feature in on-going experiments to study reflection of the soliton from a solid surface. \n\n\n\nThroughout the period of this grant we have worked closely with a number of theory collaborators to develop an improved understanding of the formation and dynamics of bright matter-wave solitons. In particular, we have focussed on methods to utilise bright solitons in novel interferometry schemes and to probe non-equilibrium, many-body quantum effects. These studies have highlighted many fascinating avenues of future research which tackle problems intimately linked to some of the important Grand Challenges in Physics. Through this grant we have delivered a state-of-the-art experiment which has begun to investigate these key issues and is uniquely positioned to extend these studies into the future.
