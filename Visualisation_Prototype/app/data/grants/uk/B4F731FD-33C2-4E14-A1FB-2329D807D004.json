{"id":"B4F731FD-33C2-4E14-A1FB-2329D807D004","title":"Accel-RT","abstractText":"The challenge of delivering high precision radiotherapy Radiotherapy is an essential aspect of cancer treatment, making a greater contribution to overall survival than chemotherapy. 40% of those cured of cancer have had radiotherapy, and research suggests that 50% of those suffering could benefit. The number of patients receiving radiotherapy in the UK has tripled in the last decade. To try and meet increased demands, the NHS Cancer Reform Strategy has led to increased provision of modern high precision radiotherapy hardware throughout the UK, but manpower difficulties and a lack of appropriate software tools and computing power means that the newest high-precision techniques remain under-utilised. This project will build upon STFC-funded research to deliver a high performance, service based computing solution, ready for use with existing treatment platforms, and validate this solution in partnership with a leading technology supplier.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/I004297/1","grantId":"ST/I004297/1","fundValue":"361029","fundStart":"2011-12-17","fundEnd":"2015-06-15","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Michael Andrew  Parker","coPersons":["Neil Gunn Burnet","Jim  Davies","Ken  Peach"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
