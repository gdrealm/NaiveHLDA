{"id":"540A9179-3A3B-4F75-8811-BCF32DAE2BBD","title":"University of Kent - AlgaeCytes FLIP Interchange","abstractText":"Algae are a diverse group of organisms and range from small, single celled species to very large multicelled species such as the kelp we see in the sea and on beaches. They are principally photosynthetic and can therefore grow on (sun)light with few additional nutrient supplements. Their apparently simple growth requirements, CO2 neutrality and versatile biosynthesis make them attractive candidates for use in biotechnology, especially as chassis for use in Synthetic Biology ie. novel biological forms that can be engineered to produce products in new ways. We wish to develop new ways of working with algae and this will involve \n\n(i) a productive partnership between AlgaeCytes (a leading algal biotechnology company), and the School of Biosciences, University of Kent (which has a rich history in industrial biotechnology) \n(ii) development of training, tools and expertise to enable the development of new processes that will progress the academic and industrial wellbeing of the UK in this important sector. Microalgae offer great promise in industrial biotechnology, but this promise has not been realised yet and the industry remains small. The solution is to develop platforms that are much more cost-effective, using two novel approaches: we will develop a new and highly promising algal strain for commercial extraction of natural high-value compounds, and develop a model laboratory alga for use as a cell factory for high-value plant terpenoids. \n\nEach of the partners are pooling their resources (AC- commercial knowledge, proprietary strains and bespoke infrastructure for the large scale growth of microalgae and UoK - technical expertise in the manipulation of microalgae and the optimisation and analysis of high-value products) to advance the competitive position of an SME and a university in this innovative sector and provide new protocols and microalgal strains that can be used for the production of a wide range of high value products. The applicants (CR and GKR) have proven track records in the area of molecular bioprocessing and small molecule biotransformations and their translation to industry and can offer facilities to efficiently test new systems. Links with the mainstream biotechnology sector in the UK will ensure the wider dissemination of the new technology. AC has a vast experience technically and business-wise on its Board and in its R&amp;D team. It has been operating with a business model which has drawn high praise from investors to date. Each member of the team brings complementary experience, skills and knowledge, amounting to a total of 80 years commercial and scientific experience in the field of renewable energy with plants, microbial technology and industrial biotechnology. The AC team have been involved in taking over 20 technology-based spin outs from idea to commercialisation in their careers. They have also been involved in guiding over 100 technology-based company start ups in their roles as advisors or board members. \n\nThe proposed FLIP programme will facilitate the development of a new collaboration between a world-leading academic laboratory in the field of industrial biotechnology and a Kent-based SME that is at the forefront of microalgal biotechnology to deliver a range of products of importance in public health. The outcomes of the project would enable UoK and AC to contribute to the emerging UK Algal Biotechnology Sector by accelerating the learning curve for improving the productivity of algal strains using synthetic biology. This will help underpin bespoke training in the field and generate new fine and speciality chemicals and natural products using this novel platform technological approach. The partners will seek protection of IP of any new technologies and reagents as these will be of immense interest to industry and have wider societal benefits and applications.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/N004043/1","grantId":"BB/N004043/1","fundValue":"128801","fundStart":"2015-08-01","fundEnd":"2017-07-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"C  Robinson","coPersons":["Gary Kevin Robinson"],"organisation":"University of Kent","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
