The health, welfare, economic and environmental impacts of bovine mastitis are severe. It is the most common\ncause of on-farm death and premature culling. With an incidence rate of clinical mastitis of 60/100 cows/year more than\none million cows are affected per annum in the UK alone. Mastitis treatment and control accounts for over 30% of all\nantibiotic use in dairy cattle. Annual losses exceed &pound;170M in the UK; 38% of the total direct costs of disease. Therefore\nmastitis substantially reduces the efficiency of dairy farming and an increased rate of culling of mastitic animals adversely\naffects the environment and the drive towards national and international food security, while antibiotic use in cattle may\nalso spread resistance to bacteria that impact on human health.\n\nMastitis is caused by a bacterial infection; the bacteria enter the mammary gland via the teat canal. The central premise of\nmastitis control is to minimise the risk of infection by reducing transmission of bacterial pathogens into the udder. In order\nto control mastitis, it is necessary to understand how and when bacterial infections occur and how the pathogens cause an\ninfection. Although only a few species of bacteria commonly cause bovine mastitis, it is now recognised that sub species\n(strains) of these bacteria behave in different ways in terms of disease transmission and outcome. The aim of this research\nis to develop a method to differentiate strains of the most common mastitis pathogen, S uberis, according to their disease\ntransmission characteristics. To do this, a modern, high throughput method of mass spectrometry (matrix-assisted laser\ndesorption ionization/time-of-flight mass spectrometry - MALDI-TOF-MS) will be used to differentiate strains of S uberis.\nThese strains will be grouped according to how they cause mastitis and the outcome of disease. This infomation will then\nbe used to inform mastitis control programmes which will include reduced use of antibiotics on farm.\n\nIf successful, his research will pride a new and improved approach to mastitis control in dairy cows. This would be to the\nbenefit of dairy farmers (reduced disease costs), veterinary surgeons and advisors (improved ability to advise on mastitis\ncontrol), the dairy industry (improved sustainability, welfare and image by reducing mastitis) and consumers (improved cow\nwelfare and food security).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/M005119/1","grantId":"BB/M005119/1","fundValue":"120566","fundStart":"2014-08-31","fundEnd":"2016-02-28","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Martin Jeremy Green","coPersons":["Peers Lewis Davies"],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
