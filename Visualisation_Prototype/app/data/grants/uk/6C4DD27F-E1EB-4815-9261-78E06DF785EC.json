{"id":"6C4DD27F-E1EB-4815-9261-78E06DF785EC","title":"Planetary Formation and Ring-Satellite Interactions","abstractText":"We propose to write a computer code that can be used to solve major problems in planetary formation and the area of ring-satellite interactions. Two important problems in understanding the origin of the solar system are (i) the formation of the terrestrial planets and (ii) the formation of the cores of the giant planets. A major problem in planetary ring dynamics is understanding the detailed interactions between rings and nearby orbiting moons. In order to tackle both of these areas we propose to develop a computer program that is equally adept at modelling the processes that operated during the early solar system as the planets formed, and the processes that are operating now in parts of Saturn's rings when narrow rings or ring edges are being perturbed by passing moons. The gravitational physics is the same in each case; it is only the starting conditions and physical parameters that differ.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=PP/D002265/1","grantId":"PP/D002265/1","fundValue":"198543","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Richard Paul Nelson","coPersons":["Carl  Murray"],"organisation":"Queen Mary, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
