Cell growth and cell division are coordinated and controlled by a wide range of signals that ensure they occur only at appropriate times. At the extremes, developing embryos require rapid growth while adults require much slower growth to replace damaged or dying cells. When there is a loss of growth control, diseases such as cancer can develop, while a failure to promote growth when required can cause a failure to repair damaged cells or cause tissue wasting. We have been studying how cells control the conversion of nutrients into the new proteins that are required for life. Almost all cellular functions are performed by proteins. Each one is made from building blocks called amino acids that are linked in chains and folded to make 3-dimensional structures that are important for each to fulfil their individual roles. The instructions required to make each protein correctly are determined by the DNA sequences of the genes in the genome. This is termed 'protein synthesis' and it is the final step in the pathway called 'gene expression' which is critical for ensuring that the correct genes are decoded at the correct place and time. \n Protein synthesis occurs within molecular machines called ribosomes that decode instructions relayed from the genome within intermediary molecules called messenger RNAs (mRNAs). Human cells each contain over a million ribosomes. mRNA decoding by ribosomes is made possible by the concerted action of 'helpers' called protein synthesis factors and adapter molecules called transfer RNAs (tRNAs) that bring the necessary amino acids together. This proposal concerns the initiation phase in which a dedicated set of factors act.. Protein synthesis initiation factors direct the ribosome and a specialised tRNA called initiator tRNA that starts proteins with the amino acid methionine (designated Met-tRNAi) to the correct start place on each mRNA. This is critical to make the right proteins in every cell. This must be done both accurately and rapidly Initiation is the most complex phase of protein synthesis and the least well understood at the molecular level.. This proposal concerns factors designated eIF2B, eIF2 and Met-tRNAi.\n In this proposal we describe preliminary experiments that have uncovered a novel function for the factor eIF2B. \n eIF2B is known as a factor that 'switches on' its partner eIF2 so that eIF2 can bind to Met-tRNAi and recruit it to ribosomes. We have found that eIF2B has a second role to remove another factor (eIF5) from eIF2. This happens before eIF2B switches on eIF2. eIF2B is a complicated protein with five parts and both the existing and new roles only require 2 of them. Genetic and biochemical studies, including many done in our laboratory, indicate that eIF2B has further essential roles and here we outline our plan to investigate those. Specifically we will evaluate how eIF2B accelerates Met-tRNAi binding to eIF2 and how Met-tRNAi then promotes removal of eIF2B. As eIF2B mutations cause the fatal brain disease called 'Vanishing white matter disease' (VWM) we will investigate how the mutations causing VWM alter these new activities. Because protein synthesis is one of several functions critical for all our cells we believe that it is important to study this now, while we have a lead in this area of research.\n By providing a detailed understanding of the contribution of eIF2B to the control of protein synthesis it will help understand control of cell growth and provide further insight into how VWM causes disease. The work may also be of interest to industries eg those that produce specific proteins as drug therapeutics or for commercial products or those that grow cells by fermentation because it will allow an improved understanding of protein synthesis mechanism. By understanding the precise controls of protein synthesis this may help in the design optimized commercial protein expression or fermentation systems.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/L000652/1","grantId":"BB/L000652/1","fundValue":"312843","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2016-09-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Graham David Pavitt","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":" Research in progress research ongoing for 1 year.
