{"id":"41BA4B52-0910-43B2-B6FC-34CF1CEF4132","title":"Novel energy-sensing pathways in the brain","abstractText":"Blood sugar goes up and down between meals, telling the brain when it is time to start and stop eating. If this natural communication between energy levels and behaviour goes wrong, sleep and body weight go awry, leading to insomnia, obesity, anorexia, or excessive sleepiness. For a long time it remained a mystery how eating controls the brain, but scientists recently found that glucose, the sugar in the blood which goes up after meals, turns off brain cells that make us awake and hungry. This is exciting because it can explain common experiences such as feeling sleepy after a meal, but at the same time it is mysterious because sugar is an energy fuel, and usually it turns cells on not off. In our research, we are seeking to understand exactly how sugar turns off the special type of brain cell that makes us awake and hungry.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F00172X/1","grantId":"BB/F00172X/1","fundValue":"283961","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Denis  Burdakov","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
