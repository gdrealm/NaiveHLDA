There are also no specific warning signs for impending premature ovarian failure and unfortunately, premature ovarian failure also leads to increased risks of developing other health problems including osteoporosis. For so common a condition, it is surprising that only 30% of cases have a known cause. Therefore, there is a clear and urgent need to further our knowledge of the physiology that underlies premature ovarian failure. Dr. Suzannah Williams at the University of Oxford is using a novel mouse model to investigate the physiology of premature ovarian failure. These females have abnormal ovarian function and are infertile, elevated gonadotrophins and decreased ovarian steroids concentrations which in women, leads to a diagnosis of premature ovarian failure. This mouse model undergoes premature ovarian failure by 3 months of age and this provides a window to investigate the onset of this condition. These studies will further our understanding of basic ovarian physiology, and the onset and maintenance of ovarian failure. It is hoped that these studies will identify potential targets to investigate in women with premature ovarian failure which may in time lead to the development of methods to reverse it. The mouse model central to this proposal is generated by egg-specific deletion of two enzymes early in egg development. This mouse model identifies a role for the egg in maintaining the function of the ovary because this is the only cell that has been genetically modified. Furthermore, genetic modification only occurs after eggs have begun to develop which means that all eggs quietly waiting in the ovary for use later in reproductive life remain unaltered. Therefore, the ovaries in this mouse model contain normal eggs, as do women with follicular premature ovarian failure, and these mice have the potential to become fertile again if we can unravel how premature ovarian failure has been induced. In this research proposal we will analyse this mouse model as it becomes infertile investigating ovarian physiology, hormone and steroid concentrations, and ovary gene expression.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0900058","grantId":"G0900058","fundValue":"497410","fundStart":"2010-03-24","fundEnd":"2013-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Suzannah Alice Williams","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
