{"id":"3AF07368-0B39-40B7-A3AB-890057326E9D","title":"Testing the 'Risk Society' Hypothesis","abstractText":"<p>The research projects tests the key claim of the Risk Society Theory that social life has become more uncertain, because people are faced with greater choices in more flexible family and working lives. One outcome of these shifts is greater individualisation, the process whereby the traditional framework of support, which structures the individualâ€™s life course, weakens and life becomes 'risky'.</p> \n<p>The research will put these claims to an empirical test by analysing three cohorts of 16 year olds, born in the 1950, 1970s and 1980s respectively, using the National Child Development Study (NCDS), the British Cohort Study (1970BCS) and the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS). It contrasts the aspirations, expectations and behaviours of young people at age 16 and, again, in their early to mid 20s. It is looking for evidence of greater distancing from traditional life patterns and values (as expressed by the young person's parents) between successive cohorts. In addition, it looks for evidence of a growing confidence in people's own judgements and in their access to resources, which will help them make the right choice in the absence of traditional normative frameworks.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-1751","grantId":"RES-000-22-1751","fundValue":"68427","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2008-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Andreas  Cebulla","coPersons":["Peter Frederick Taylor-Gooby"],"organisation":"National Centre for Social Research","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
