{"id":"381D0A51-76C2-4FCA-A5B3-869E1D9B9BAA","title":"Sustaining Ethno-Cultural Significance of Products through Urban Ecologies of Creative Practice","abstractText":"By drawing on experiences from the traditions and cultural heritage of China and the UK, and through knowledge\nexchange, this project examines the challenges and opportunities for sustaining designs and products of ethno-cultural\nsignificance through the creation of urban ecologies of creative practice in major Chinese cities. It will result in a joint\nauthored report that includes: Urban Ecologies of Creative Practice: A framework for understanding the current condition\nand future potential, socially and economically, of culturally significant designs, products and practices in Chinese cities.\nThis will be of interest to those in government and business sectors related primarily to The Creative Industries, with strong\nassociated links to the themes of Humanities Contributing to Development and Urban Transformations. The project will\ndevelop a common understanding that recognises:\n\na. different qualities and stages of sustainment of culturally significant designs, products and practices in China and the UK;\nb. related rural-urban contexts, between the two countries and\nc. from the above, investigate commonalities, differences and opportunities for mutual learning and research development\nin relation to culturally significant designs, products and practices - leading to a framework defining key characteristics,\nstrengths, weaknesses, benefits and obstacles, and future potential and opportunities for culturally significant designs and\nproducts within Urban Ecologies of Creative Practice in Chinese cities.\n\nWhile there are more and more re-examinations of the quality of Chinese cities after their rapid expansions in recent years,\nthis urban development can lead to a transition from hard power (politics, law) to soft power (culture, economy). The rich\nethnic cultures in China, especially those migrating from rural areas into cities, are set to reshape the soft power, which has\nthe potential to promote the sustainable development of cities and ethnic cultures. This research aims at how to understand\nand carry forward ethnic cultures in the transformation of Chinese cities through studying creative designs, products and\nservices.\n\nThis research will be conducted in China and the UK. The project includes 6 visits - 3 by China researchers to the UK in\nAutumn 2016, 2017, 2018 and 3 by UK researchers to China in Spring 2016, 2017 and 2018. Each will include site\nvisits and workshops. The latter two (one in UK, one in China) include extended workshops to develop the framework and\nthe final workshop includes Creative Industries representatives from the private sector and government.\n\nThese visits will each result in a Summary Report and contribution to a joint website Gallery and Blog Series. In addition,\njoint summary reports will be produced documenting the emergent understandings of the relevance and role of the internet\nand digital space in the future directions of culturally significant designs, products and practices. Emerging understandings,\ninsights and conclusions will inform the creation and successive refinements of the Framework. A summary report and\nGallery contributions will document the outcomes and insights drawn from the International Studios with students.\n\nThe final project report will provide an overview of the project, the finalised framework, as well as project outcomes,\nconclusions, and identification for future joint research themes and opportunities.\n\nODA Compliance: Ethno-Cultural products and practices have a strong relationship to the notions of 'good work' and\nemployment thus to economic development and growth. This research will contribute to education and knowledge\ndevelopment, among researchers, the students, and private sector and government participants. Wider dissemination of\nfindings through various publications will inform future research directions related to the creative industries, humanities\ncontributing to development and urban transformations.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/N006844/1","grantId":"AH/N006844/1","fundValue":"59493","fundStart":"2016-02-01","fundEnd":"2019-01-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Stuart  Walker","coPersons":["Martyn  Evans","Rachel  Cooper OBE"],"organisation":"Lancaster University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
