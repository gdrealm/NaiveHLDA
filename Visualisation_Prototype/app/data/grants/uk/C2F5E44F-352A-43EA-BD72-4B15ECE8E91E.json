{"id":"C2F5E44F-352A-43EA-BD72-4B15ECE8E91E","title":"Developing knowledge exchange in the live music sector","abstractText":"The purpose of the proposed project is to develop activities to maximise the impact of a three year research project on the history of live music promotion in Britain. In the course of that project we had many conversations with promoters and other participants in the live music sector which enabled us to think more clearly about the importance of academic research findings for their everyday practice. In particular our discussions with promoters thus suggested the need for \n\n-an accessible archive of reliable research data so that each new policy initiative, whether at local or national level, doesn't have to begin with a 'mapping' of the field, the re-gathering of data that has been gathered many times before;\n\n -a consensual understanding of best research practice, drawing on comprehensive critical knowledge of the various academic and other research studies of the UK's music sector; \n\n- music business training programmes providing properly informed teaching of the skills required in the promotional business;\n \n-better public understanding of the live music business.\n\nWith these needs in mind this follow-on project will focus on a variety of knowledge exchange processes: the development of an on-line research based commentary on and forum for the discussion on live music issues; the provision of research reports as the basis of an accessible online data base; the organisation of research panels, workshops and other events; the development of training material. \n\nIn general terms the follow-on project is designed not just to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the dissemination of our own research findings but also to explore the ways in which academic research can be used as a mechanism for improving the public understanding of the live music sector and provide mechanisms for communication between different interest groups within that sector.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/J00474X/1","grantId":"AH/J00474X/1","fundValue":"95251","fundStart":"2012-02-01","fundEnd":"2013-05-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Simon  Frith","coPersons":["Martin John Cloonan"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
