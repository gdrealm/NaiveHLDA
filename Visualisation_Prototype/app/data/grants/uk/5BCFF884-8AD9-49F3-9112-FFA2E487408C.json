Common conditions such as diabetes and herpes infection, as well as treatment with certain forms of chemotherapy, can all cause nerve damage, which may be irreversible. A drug called gabapentin (initially developed for the treatment of epilepsy) is effective in the alleviation of this type of pain (which is called neuropathic pain). However, gabapentin is not equally effective in all patients with nerve-injury pain. We know how gabapentin works in the treatment of neuropathic pain, as it binds to a protein called alpha2delta-1, and the amount of this protein in pain-sensing nerves is increased several-fold in experimental models of neuropathic pain. Our study aims to examine whether different forms of alpha2delta-1 are produced in neuropathic pain conditions. These forms might show altered properties, such as higher or lower ability to recognise gabapentin. We will also investigate whether genetic variability in the gene for alpha2delta-1 may affect sensitivity to gabapentin. If this were the case it might be highly relevant to the development and treatment of neuropathic pain in patients, as it might explain why gabapentin is not similarly effective in all patients. It is also possible that this research will aid in the development of novel drugs in this class, that might have the potential to be more effective in certain patients or in certain conditions.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0801756","grantId":"G0801756","fundValue":"313132","fundStart":"2009-07-01","fundEnd":"2012-06-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Annette Catherine Dolphin","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
