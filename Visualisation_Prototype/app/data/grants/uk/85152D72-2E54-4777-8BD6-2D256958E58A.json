The proposed method will extent two preceding methods by improving them in several important ways. In brief, the most significant improvement is that the proposed method will allow a confirmatory as well as an explanatory analysis of the data. This is facilitated by the use of pseudo-pathways the test statistic will be based on which represent more than mere associations among genes. For this reason these pseudo-pathways contain information exploitable by an explanatory analysis that may enhance an biological understanding of the data beyond the results provided by hypotheses tests alone. This combination ensures an efficient data analysis to obtain the maximum amount of information usable for a functional interpretation of pathological pathways of complex diseases like cancer.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H048871/1","grantId":"EP/H048871/1","fundValue":"101130","fundStart":"2011-03-01","fundEnd":"2012-06-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Frank  Emmert-Streib","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Queen's University of Belfast","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
