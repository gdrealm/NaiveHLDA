{"id":"69929DAB-1B8F-4FC4-88B0-29CCEFDEF8B2","title":"Energy absorbing mooring systems: Risk-based investigation for high intensity typhoon conditions in China (MoTyph)","abstractText":"Wave energy technology in China could potentially contribute 13GW of installed power to the country's energy\nneeds with particular benefit to coastal regions that have limited local energy resources. Commercial wave\nenergy development in China is hampered by low wave power density levels between 2-7kW/m, an order of\nmagnitude less than the UK, yet suffers on average from more than 10 high intensity typhoon events a year,\ncausing extreme wind and wave conditions. This project aims to address the survivability of wave energy converters in Chinese waters during reoccurring high intensity typhoons. The research will explore the development of cost-effective mooring systems.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M019942/1","grantId":"EP/M019942/1","fundValue":"127133","fundStart":"2014-10-31","fundEnd":"2015-08-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Philipp Rudolf Thies","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Exeter","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
