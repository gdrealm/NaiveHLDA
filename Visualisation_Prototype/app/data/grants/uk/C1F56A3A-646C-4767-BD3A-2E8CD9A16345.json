{"id":"C1F56A3A-646C-4767-BD3A-2E8CD9A16345","title":"WORKSHOP: Research Symposium: Logic and Mathematics 09","abstractText":"Logic and Mathematics 09 will be a five day workshop/research symposium to be held at the University of York in August 2009 devoted to the interaction between ideas and techniques from mathematical logic and other areas of mathematics. On the logic side this includes: - nonstandard analysis (the modern theory of infinitesimal and infinite numbers) and its extensions. This theory gives access to ideal structures that otherwise exist only on an intuitive basis- model theory: the study of relationships between the language of mathematics and its logic and the actual world of mathematical objects and structures. Current research focusses in particular on definability theory - the study of objects that can be precisely defined using logical language- constructive mathematics and its logical foundations- reverse mathematics (or proof mining) - the investigation of exactly what logical principles and assumptions are needed for particular mathematical resultsAreas of mathematics that are involved in such interactions include classical mathematical analysis, differential equations, number theory, probability theory, stochastic analysis, algebraic geometry, mathematical physics and mathematical finance.The Symposium will bring together researchers whose work involves interactions between mathematical logic and other areas of mathematics, in order to share ideas and the results of recent work, as well as to explore new avenues of research. An underlying theme is the recognition of the essential unity of mathematics in spite of the fact that the mushrooming of research activity has led to compartmentalization of the subject area. Thus the participants will represent a wide variety of topics within the general theme Logic and Mathematics.The current proposal to the EPSRC is for the support (travel and subsistence) of five participants from overseas (Di Nasso, Jin, Keisler, Loeb, Ross) who have already indicated their willingness to participate, and for subsistence for five further as yet unspecified participants from among those who have indicated that they will participate. It is anticipated that there will be 14 - 18 invited participants, all invited to give a presentation of their current work. Invited participants other than those covered by this proposal will be supported from other sources. Other non-invited participants will have the opportunity to present their work for discussion but there will be a refereeing process.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G057192/1","grantId":"EP/G057192/1","fundValue":"8547","fundStart":"2009-07-27","fundEnd":"2009-10-26","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Nigel John  Cutland","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of York","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
