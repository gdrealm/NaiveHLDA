{"id":"541BE132-D927-4141-B089-341EFC140A2C","title":"Creation of non-volatile organic memory RFID tags (sleepertag)","abstractText":"The SleeperTag project combines leading edge research from the science base with industrial expertise from the industrial partners to develop an RFID tag that can be turned 'off' and 'on' repeatedly without replacing the tag. This breakthrough in tag design using organic non-volatile memory will be applied to the packaging of anti-viral drugs. This will enable suppliers of the drugs (and governments) to identify black market antiretroviral drugs re-entering the UK and Western Europe.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=DT/F002955/1","grantId":"DT/F002955/1","fundValue":"202712","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"William  Eccleston","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
