In the future there will be immense pressure to produce economically valuable materials with much reduced environmental impact. This means the Industrial Biotechnology sector (which is related to, but distinct from the Pharmaceutical Industry) in the UK has a golden opportunity to harness world class science. This proposal links first class academic science with unique expertise available in an innovative small company, Ingenza. The main aim of the project is to develop a bacterial system (cell factory) for the production of novel customizable and highly modified cyclic peptides in significant quantities. Cyclic peptides are found as antibiotics, anticancer agents, in hormone therapy and in immune system modifying agents. In addition to their direct medicinal role, they are also very useful tools in studying biological processes, this second role, as tools, is underdeveloped simply because natural products are hard to make in sufficient amounts. The proposed work will solve these problems by providing a plug 'n' play system in which changes can be made simply and quickly to the 'cell factory' to produce a vast array of cyclic peptides at a useful scale.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/L004380/1","grantId":"BB/L004380/1","fundValue":"58261","fundStart":"2013-05-01","fundEnd":"2015-03-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  In this completed project we successfully used intein technology to ligate synthetic peptides to leader peptides. This creates a new substrate peptide for the patellamide pathway. Of critical importance is that approach allows us to combine chemical diversity with enzymatic processing giving rise to new molecules.

This class of molecules has some very interesting medical properties including reversal of cancer drug resistance. In their current isolated form the molecules are not useful, we need to make variants of them. This project allowed us to make molecules that do not exist in nature.
