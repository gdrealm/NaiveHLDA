We have recently developed and normalised a new preschool attention battery for children aged 3-6 years, or children with a mental age in this range.&nbsp; The current project will use this battery to examine how attention processes are affected in WS and DS.&nbsp; We will explore whether components of attention found to be separable in typically-developing groups are also separable in WS and DS, and whether they show differential levels of impairment.&nbsp; We will also explore how attention processes in these children are related to functions of the dorsal and ventral visual streams. Dorsal stream functioning, involved in visuo-spatial processing and guiding action, is known to be impaired in a number of developmental disorders.&nbsp; We will examine whether this 'dorsal stream vulnerability' is related to problems of attention.&nbsp; Results will provide a much needed insight into the specifics of attention impairment in WS and DS, informing cognitive and developmental literatures and approaches to education for children with these difficulties.\n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2659","grantId":"RES-000-22-2659","fundValue":"79090","fundStart":"2008-01-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Janette  Atkinson","coPersons":["Kate  Breckenridge"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
