JD is of significant economic importance to the management of cattle, sheep and goats due to loss in milk production and the need for premature culling when the disease becomes advanced; the cost has been estimated to be $1.5billion pa. in the USA and &pound;13million pa. in the UK. Current measures to control the spread of JD have been shown to be inadequate and at present more than half of cattle herds in the UK are infected and nearly all herds in some other developed countries, including the USA. MAP is excreted in very large amounts in later stages of infection but can also be excreted even when current vaccines are used. This has led to the spread of MAP into wildlife reservoirs and contamination of environmental reservoirs such as rivers and lakes. MAP is excreted by infected dairy cattle in their milk and is present in supermarket milk as it survives pasteurization. There is an increasingly convincing link between MAP infection and Crohn's disease in humans, MAP has been detected in up to half of normal human intestinal samples and nearly all of Crohn's Disease samples. Currently, commercially available whole cell vaccines do not provide complete protection against JD. They may relieve clinical symptoms but do not significantly reduce the number of animals that are infected or stop excretion of MAP into milk and faeces. By allowing the induction of sub-clinical infection, these vaccines may hide the problem of MAP infection and consequently be counterproductive. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a better vaccine to treat this disease and to understand the way that MAP affects the animal's immune system to cause JD. This project will study a new type of vaccine that has been shown to work in mice. It uses two viruses that will not grow in animals or the environment, to deliver a cocktail of AP antigens called HAV. Although vaccination trials in mice do not always transfer successfully to other animal species, results from preliminary experiments have shown that the prime-boost vaccination method we are proposing to use has been beneficial in conferring a degree of protection against other mycobacterial infections. We will look at the ability of the HAV vaccine to prevent an experimental infection of calves with MAP and measure in detail the cattle's immune system with the aim of understanding how this new type of vaccine might be working. This work will improve our knowledge of mycobacterial disease processes and could therefore also benefit other related research such as vaccines for tuberculosis for example. If the study does show that the new vaccine may be protective it could be a first step in improving the control of this increasingly spreading disease.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/H010718/1","grantId":"BB/H010718/1","fundValue":"235928","fundStart":"2011-09-01","fundEnd":"2013-08-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The major finding from the research is that the HAV vaccine significantly reduces the excretion of M. avium paratuberculosis in the faeces of infected calves. This is important since spread of the organism is largely through cattle to cattle transmission via exposure to infected faecal material. We have defined immune parameters associated with this reduction that can be used to screen vaccine efficacy in the field. This could have a major impact on the economic burden caused by infection with MAP and subsequent Johne's disease. Since MAP has been proposed as the cause of human disease the findings may also translate to human medicine. We have applied for subsequent funding, and engaged in discussions with industrial partners to follow on from this project. We have also developed and presented to the public through various events providing dialogue with animal and human health interested parties.

Calves were vaccinated with the HAV vaccine or control (sham) vaccinated and infected with MAP ten weeks later. Immune responses were assessed up to week 36 post-infection. Tissues were assessed post-mortem for the presence of inflammatory cell populations. Bacterial loads in peripheral blood, in faeces and in tissues taken post-mortem were assessed at the lead institution (St Georges University London). Whole blood cytokine secretion profiles and antibody responses were assessed by subcontractors at AFBI-NI.\n\nSignificant differences between HAV and sham vaccinated animals have been demonstrated. Most importantly there was a highly significant reduction in the number of bacteria present in the gut of the HAV vaccinated animals indicating that the vaccine was inducing protection from infection. There was no shedding of MAP in the faeces of HAV vaccinated cattle whereas infected calves shed MAP regularly. The reduction in MAP burden was associated with altered immune responses. Notably the cytokine expression profiles differed between groups. Differences were noted in the presence of pro-inflammatory cell populations in peripheral blood and gut tissues that appear to be associated with progression to disease in the sham vaccinated cattle, and with protective immunity in HAV vaccinated cattle. Significant differences in MAP killing activity within blood macrophages were noted. The overall conclusion is that HAV vaccination induces a significant degree of protection against infection with MAP and reduces shedding and disease progression. The development of new vaccines that reduce the burden of MAP infection and Johne's disease in ruminants has potential major impact on animal health and the economy. In order to take this research forward a larger scale trial is required to determine the efficacy of the HAV vaccine in a field situation. This would enable the determination of the effectiveness of this strategy for control of infection in a natural setting where calves are potentially continually exposed to Mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis, or which may be infected already at the time of vaccination. An alternative approach would be to test the protective efficacy of the HAV antigens as a subunit vaccine delivered with adjuvant rather than as a viral vectored vaccine. The potential of a single administration vaccine (rather than prime-boost as described in the original project) and determination of the duration of immunity are important future goals. The vaccine could be widely used for reduction or prevention of disease which would be of widespread benefit.\nIn addition, the description of immune responses that correlate with the reduction in bacterial load, or those which are associated with disease progression and intestinal inflammation could be used to further understand responses in the gut that are relevant to other diseases and also to related conditions in other species (e.g. Crohn's disease in humans).
