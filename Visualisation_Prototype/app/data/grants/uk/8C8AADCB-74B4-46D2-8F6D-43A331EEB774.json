These speech-accompanying gestures often represent ideas which a speaker has in mind and is trying to communicate. </p>\n\n<p>This research project investigates language use in social interaction, focusing on how speakers design their utterances for different interlocutors. However, while past research into this issue has focused almost exclusively on verbal communication, this project applies a broader perspective by taking into account the verbal as well as the gestural side of utterances. More specifically, the project will investigate cooperative behaviour in social interaction by examining how speakers use gesture and speech to provide information that matches their addressees' requirements. </p>\n\n<p>Experiment 1 tests the effect of knowledge shared by interlocutors (common ground) on speech and gesture use. </p>\n\n<p>Experiment 2 investigates how speakers communicate in triads when the participants in the conversation differ in terms of their common ground. </p>\n\n<p>Experiments 3 and 4 examine the effect of addressee feedback leading to the repair of utterances on speech and gesture use. </p>\n\n<p>This research will tell us more about how people collaborate in face-to-face interaction and will shed new light on some core aspects of language use.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-061-23-0135","grantId":"RES-061-23-0135","fundValue":"107549","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2008-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Judith Anne Holler","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
