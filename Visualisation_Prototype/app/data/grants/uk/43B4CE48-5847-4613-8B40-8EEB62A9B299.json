{"id":"43B4CE48-5847-4613-8B40-8EEB62A9B299","title":"Expanding the repertoire for piano and live electronics","abstractText":"The repertoire of pieces for piano and electronically-generated sounds has been dominated by works with a soundtrack since the 1950s, where a fixed pre-recorded part accompanies the live performer. Despite the technological developments and also performers' and composers' involvement with live electronics, there is not a significant body of notated repertoire easily available for performance by those other than the creators. This is because of the highly experimental nature of creating these pieces and the technology needed to perform them but with the pervasiveness of laptops and increasing accessibility to other equipment it is now relevant, possible and I would argue necessary to not only enlarge but also actively disseminate newly created repertoire to a larger audience. \\n\\nThe main aim of this project therefore is to create new notated and transferable pieces for piano and live electronics with experts in the field of electro-acoustic performance. I will work with all project partners here to create pieces which investigate the full spectrum of possibilities from 'guided improvisation' to fully composed and from using only simple analogue electronics to using MAX/MSP and other innovative software. I anticipate the pieces will highlight different elements of electro-acoustic performance: technical, compositional, aesthetic and theoretical, as well as a range of performance issues.\\n\\nRelated to this I will also be investigating the use of sensors and also possible future development of the piano. My position as a respected concert pianist specialising in contemporary music and with an extensive experience of working with composers on new music, means I am well placed to both create and disseminate this new repertoire. All of the partners I will be working with are researching various aspects of performance and composition with live electronics and as such are best placed to assist me in developing new approaches to this performance environment. Together we will also endeavour to capture each piece in a notational way that can be transferred to and re-created by other performers. \\n\\nI have divided the process into four sections to direct my understanding and engagement. \\n\\n1.\\nThe first objective of my research is to become expertly competent with a range of electronic equipment, developing methods and techniques for controlling electronics from the piano whilst performing live. There are many physical and logistical questions to be answered and increasing levels of complexity and technological involvement. \\n\\n2.\\nThe next objective is to begin to define my own electro-acoustic language and in doing so, to engage with compositional and improvisational questions in practical sessions with the listed research partners. I wish to explore particular improvisational issues such as complexity, structure, consistency, whether idiomatic results occur particularly with electronics and if so, whether strategies can and should be developed to avoid them. \\n\\n3.\\nMy third objective is to investigate the gestural control of electronics: specifically to explore the use of sensors in increasing performer autonomy in electro-acoustic performance. What I am interested in researching is whether I can control sonic manipulation through gesture with enough complexity in the results and without impacting on my natural approach to the keyboard.\\n\\n\\n4. [Research Partners to include piano technicians and potentially STEIM ]\\n\\nI wish to begin a consultation process to investigate the possibility of eventually designing a new electro-acoustic instrument, the HYPer-piANO. This is the longest term element of this project and will - during the 8 month period - consist of discussion, investigation and possibly laying out some initial design plans. I anticipate that if this process generates real outside interest, I would then applyfor separate research funding to take it further.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/E010083/1","grantId":"AH/E010083/1","fundValue":"16425","fundStart":"2007-05-14","fundEnd":"2008-02-29","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Sarah Louise Nicolls","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Brunel University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
