The factors that influence susceptibility and/or govern its highly variable course remain unknown. Over the past three years, several large genome-wide association studies in multiple sclerosis have been completed, providing an unbiased assessment of the factors that influence susceptibility. At present there are 26 known MS genetic markers, and with the recent completion of the largest GWAS in multiple sclerosis of over 10,000 cases, this list will expand considerably. As our knowledge of the genetic factors contributing to disease susceptibility increases, the next priority is to understand the functional consequences of these genetic variants. One such mechanism may be through the regulation of gene expression. We will recruit a large sample of 200 cases and 200 controls and test all common coding variants in genes lying within regions containing established multiple sclerosis susceptibility variants to examine if there is allele specific expression (ASE) in heterozygous samples. By directly examining for the preferential expression of one allele, this provides a measure of the ?real? effect on expression by reducing the effects of environmental and other factors that can influence gene expression. ASE will be analysed in two subpopulations of T cells (CD4+ and CD8+), which are known to be involved in the disease pathology of multiple sclerosis as well as in 64 brain tissue samples. By looking for ASE in both cases and controls we will be able to examine if the spectrum of ASE differs between cases and controls and in examining both T cells and brain tissue we can correlate observed ASE with a particular cell/tissue phenotype.\nThe susceptibility loci thus far established in multiple sclerosis do not account for all the heritability seen epidemiologically, and it is thought that some of this may be explained by parent-of-origin effects. By recruiting and genotyping both parents of the 200 cases for all the variants studied, we will examine for parent-of-origin effects at loci showing ASE and assess whether these parental effects are restricted to specific cell/tissues.\nThis systematic analysis of ASE across the regions identified from our genome screening work will provide greater understanding of the effects of associated genetic variants on gene expression. Understanding the cells/tissues in which these effects are present will also help to refine disease mechanisms and promote the development of logical new therapies.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1100125","grantId":"G1100125","fundValue":"246471","fundStart":"2012-01-01","fundEnd":"2013-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Stephen James Sawcer","coPersons":["Maria  Ban","Alastair  Compston"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
