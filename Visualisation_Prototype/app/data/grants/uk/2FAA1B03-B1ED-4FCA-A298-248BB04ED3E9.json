We now have a greatly increased knowledge of oxidation of volatile organic compounds at night by their reaction with the NO3 radical. this in turn will lead to a better understanding of how nighttime process affect air pollution in the UK. Organisations such as the UK Met Office can use our findings to input into their air quality forecast models, which provide information to the general public on upcoming levels of air pollution. It is our hope that the research from this project will improve the accuracy of these models. Environment","dataset":"gtr"}
