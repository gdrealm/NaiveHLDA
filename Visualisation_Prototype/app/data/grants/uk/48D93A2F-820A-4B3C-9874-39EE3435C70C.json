In some areas khat leaves or twigs are chewed for their stimulant properties. The study will explore the relationship between ethnic identity and the production, trade and consumption of khat in Uganda.</p> \n<p>The study has five objectives:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>To trace the role of Yemeni and Somali migrants in promoting the spread of khat production and consumption in Uganda</li> \n <li>To gain an understanding of the role of the khat industry in forging or undermining ethnic-based identities in Uganda</li> \n <li>To trace emergent modes of consumption in relation to ethnicity and identity</li> \n <li>To examine patterns of behaviour after chewing khat, in particular the use of alcohol and other substances</li> \n <li>To engage in the Uganda prohibition debate and to trace the origins of the views held by government and civil society</li>\n</ul> \n<p>A range of research methods will be used including: participant-observation of khat markets and consumption settings, collection of oral histories from Somali and Yemeni elders, a questionnaire survey of consumers and a participatory workshop with policy makers.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E021565/1","grantId":"ES/E021565/1","fundValue":"166105","fundStart":"2007-07-01","fundEnd":"2009-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Susan  Beckerleg","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
