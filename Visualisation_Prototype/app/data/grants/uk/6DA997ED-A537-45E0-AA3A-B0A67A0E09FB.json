{"id":"6DA997ED-A537-45E0-AA3A-B0A67A0E09FB","title":"Collective Worship in Schools: An Evaluation of Law and Policy in the United Kingdom","abstractText":"The majority of schools in the UK are currently required by law to organise acts of collective worship for their pupils. Yet, what is meant by 'collective worship'? What is its purpose? How should schools take account of the rights of children, parents and teachers when organising acts of collective worship? What are the legitimate interests of the state in such matters? Do significant differences exist in the way that collective worship is provided in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland? And to what extent is collective school worship capable of helping to develop shared values and cohesive and inclusive school communities in an increasingly plural and multi-cultural society? With the role of religion in public life an increasingly contentious matter for debate in the UK, these are some of the topical questions that this cross-disciplinary Research Network will seek to investigate.\n\nThe legal requirement for state schools to provide acts of collective worship, as well as the fact that the majority of such acts of collective worship during any school term must be of a 'wholly or mainly of a broadly Christian character', has long attracted controversy in the UK. However, perhaps surprisingly, relatively little has been published on this issue - a state of affairs which the Research Network aims to rectify.\n\nThe Network is composed of leading scholars from a range of disciplines including educationalists, lawyers, philosophers and sociologists, drawn from England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. Taking an holistic approach, the Network will examine whether the current laws, policies and practices surrounding the provision of collective worship throughout the UK sufficiently exploit the potential of such acts to (i) enhance individual well-being (ii) foster a sense of a collective school identity, and (iii) create flourishing school communities.\n\nA Steering Group will co-ordinate the activities of the Network. All members of the Network will attend two seminars (in Bangor and Glasgow), where each person will present papers on previously agreed areas relevant to collective worship. These research findings will then be made available to a wider audience at a public conference in Leicester, where a number of eminent figures in the fields of education, law, politics and sociology will speak. In accordance with a primary aim of the Research Network, which is to ensure the creation of meaningful partnerships between HE and non-HE stakeholders, the conference will be organised in such a way as to involve interested parties from beyond academia. These will include the representatives of the four Departments of Education in the UK, faith and secular groups, teaching and educational bodies, relevant governmental agencies, (eg., Standing Advisory Councils on Religious Education), NGOs and human rights organisations. \n\nThe papers presented at the Network's seminars and conference will be published in an edited collection of essays. It is also planned that the inter-disciplinary ties and close working-relationships forged as a result of the activities of the Network will lead to the development of a larger funding bid to facilitate empirical work on the important - yet oft neglected - issue of collective worship in schools.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/K006436/1","grantId":"AH/K006436/1","fundValue":"27261","fundStart":"2014-01-01","fundEnd":"2015-12-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Alison  Mawhinney","coPersons":["Peter  Cumper"],"organisation":"Bangor University","findingsText":" &quot;not applicable this year&quot; &quot;not applicable this year&quot; Education,Government, Democracy and Justice","dataset":"gtr"}
