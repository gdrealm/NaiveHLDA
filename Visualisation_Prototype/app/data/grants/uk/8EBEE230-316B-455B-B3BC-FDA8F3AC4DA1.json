Viral infection also hampers advanced medical technologies, such as bone marrow or liver transplantation. This Centre proposal aims to link groups working on basic virus biology, the response of patients to viruses and the development of new viral diagnostics and treaments.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G9721629","grantId":"G9721629","fundValue":"927754","fundStart":"2001-06-01","fundEnd":"2010-01-23","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Mary  Collins","coPersons":["Wendy  Barclay","Duncan  Clark","JÃ¼rgen  Roes","Jeremy Alexander Garson","Jane Amanda Skok","Paul  Griffiths","R  Coffin","Yasuhiro  Takeuchi","Benny  Chain","Mala Kunti Maini","Gregory John Towers","Chris  Boshoff","Richard Seton Tedder","Arne Nalpon Akbar","Aine  McKnight","Robin  Weiss","Tim J  Harrison","Ariberto  Fassati","Deenan  Pillay","Vincent  Emery"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
