How plants respond to external stimuli such as attack by pathogens/pests or stress conditions depends on the gene content of the plant species and the regulation of expression of the genes. Genes are regulated at many different levels. One important level is where genes are turned on or off or up or down - called transcriptional control. A second level occurs after the gene is transcribed or copied into RNA - called post-transcriptional control. There are many different mechanisms of post-transcriptional control and alternative splicing (AS) is one of the most important. Alternative splicing is where different portions of a gene transcript are joined in different combinations to generate more than one messenger RNA (mRNA) from a gene. The resultant mRNAs can be translated into proteins with different functions or can be targeted for degradation. Thus, AS increases the proteome complexity of an organism and can regulate mRNA levels. Alternative splicing affects all aspects of plant development, viability and adaptability to external conditions including abiotic stress. Nevertheless, AS in plants has been largely over-looked as a major contributor to global gene expression control despite its influence on transcript levels and on generation of differential protein functions. Current estimates suggest that a significant proportion of plant genes (35%) undergo alternative splicing. We have shown that this is clearly underestimated such that substantially more genes undergo AS and many genes have more AS events than have been described to date. In addition, alternative splicing patterns of many genes are regulated by different stress conditions and by altered levels of proteins which are involved in splicing. It is, therefore, essential to have a concerted effort to discover and identify AS events and to develop methods to accurately measure changes in AS at global and gene-specific levels. We will approach this by applying genomics and bioinformatics tools: 454 sequencing, whole genome tiling arrays, an RT-PCR system to quantify AS transcript levels and algorithms for comparing ESTs, to plants experiencing different abiotic stresses and with altered expression of splicing factors. We will identify new, un-annotated AS events, assess the technologies for their potential to provide quantitative analysis of AS and use these tools to study changes in AS under abiotic stress. We will also use these technologies to extend our examinations of the roles of specific trans-acting alternative splicing factors in regulating AS. The proposal is directly relevant to the themes of the ERA-PG call and brings together four research groups already involved in plant alternative splicing research and abiotic stress. The measurable outcomes will be novel, previously undescribed AS events deposited in appropriate databases; techniques for studying changes in AS; a database of AS events with their frequency and consequences; and information on the relationship between transcript levels and AS for many Arabidopsis genes. An overall outcome of this research will be a significantly increased awareness of the importance of AS and the need to consider AS and its consequences in post-transcriptional control of plant gene expression. Knowledge of the complexity and subtlety of all aspects of gene regulation is important in understanding how plants grow and survive and in the prediction of responses to changing environments and such awareness is the cornerstone of future plant breeding policies.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/G024979/1","grantId":"BB/G024979/1","fundValue":"395598","fundStart":"2009-07-01","fundEnd":"2012-06-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"John W Brown","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Dundee","findingsText":" Plants have around 30,000 genes which are expressed at different times and under different conditions. Expression is where a gene is turned on or off or up or down. When a gene is on, messenger RNA transcripts are made which are translated into proteins which can be structural or enzymatic etc resulting in a particular cellular state and ultimately the phenotype of the plant.

The publication of a body of papers in the area of alternative splicing and regulation in response to different conditions has had impact on the plant community. Direct exploitation is unlikely but raising awareness and understanding how AS gives plasticity to expression are important. The same considerations are being applied to crop plants as both genome sequencing and RNA-seq transcriptomics grows. Agriculture/ Food and Drink,Environment","dataset":"gtr"}
