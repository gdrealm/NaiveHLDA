{"id":"5C96F1AB-DDB4-4B80-A769-56DFA7E15F55","title":"Small Items of Research Equipment at the University of Surrey","abstractText":"This application for small scale equipment was developed from responses elicited from ECRs, defined as EPSRC funded postgraduate researchers and postdoctoral researchers, fellows (funded as independent researchers through a range of fellowship grants) and new members of staff (recruited at lecturer grade within the past academic year) and EPSRC first grant holders. The internal process involved emails and briefing meetings for ECRs, culminating in the submission of a one page proposal for the small scale equipment item(s) they had identified. The result was overwhelming, with approximately &pound;2m of eligible applications submitted for this call. This proposal has been constructed using the top quartile of these applications, with funding allocated to defined areas of research excellence which are largely, but not exclusively, in proportion to the current EPSRC funding portfolio of the University of Surrey. \n\nThis proposal seeks to demonstrate how our proposed small scale equipment allocation maps on to the EPSRC shaping capability exercise and addresses the grand challenges facing the economy and society as a whole. In constructing this proposal we have used the input from ECRs and have indicated how the investment supports their research and career development. We have used mini case studies to demonstrate the depth and breadth of activities planned, how the funding will be used and which ECRs it will benefit. These case studies also show, where possible, how the funds will be used innovatively to achieve a greater value from the equipment base. Examples include, developing national capability through funding for an EPSRC national centre and medium scale facility, developing characterisation capability for EPSRC Research Engineers in an EPSRC Industrial Doctoral Centre and improving equipment sharing across the University. \n\nThe purchase of equipments will not only enhance the research capacity of the ECRs directly involved but further encourage the whole research ommunity at the University to work collaboratively across research groups and centres to utilise the new equipment and enhance capabilities.\n\nTo further support the ECRs, the University of Surrey will provide training tailored to the development needs of the individual including workshops in leadership development, bid writing and research impact. The effectiveness of the training will be seen as all supported ECR will produce a mini case study to demonstrate the impact of the purchased equipment on them as researchers, their associated research group and the wider community. These case studies will be sent to EPSRC in the autumn of 2013. \n\nTo ensure maximum benefit to ECRs, all of the &pound;622k (&pound;498k requested from EPSRC as an 80% contribution) will be used to finance small &quot;equipment&quot; with the University bearing the FEC costs associated with technician and academic time to run the grant and install and maintain the small &quot;equipment&quot; and train and develop those who will use it being borne by the University (this accounts for an additional &pound;86k of added value).\n\nWe believe that we have strong project management and financial controls in place to ensure that the majority of the funding will be spent within 3 months of the start of the grant, with all items having been delivered by 31st March 2013.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K031317/1","grantId":"EP/K031317/1","fundValue":"498112","fundStart":"2012-11-01","fundEnd":"2013-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The activities supported by this grant have demonstrated impact in the following areas:\n1. Generating high quality academic research outputs\n2. Producing skilled researchers proficient in state-of the-art techniques transferable to academia and industry\n3. Seeding future bids for research funding\n4. Delivering innovation for industry\n\nA number of journal papers and conference presentations/papers arising from research supported by the grant have been published and are currently in preparation. It is anticipated that the volume of related outputs will grow in coming years, as the supported research matures. \n\nIn addition to the more tangible benefits of facilitating experimental research work in support of PhD projects, the equipment grant has provided an invaluable resource through which the next generation of ECRs and PG students can gain experience and skills which are transferable into future employment in industry and academia. \n\nMany of the ECRS who were beneficiaries of the equipment grant have been involved in preparing bids to industry, the EU and a variety of UK research funders, including EPSRC, for further funding for research projects and fellowships. It is envisaged that this activity will continue amongst the cohort of beneficiaries as well as their successor.\n\nMany of the projects supported through this grant involve collaboration with industry and other research organisations; the enhanced equipment base will ensure the continued viability and relevance of such important interactions, which are of significant economic and societal benefit. Some specific examples of relevant collaborations supported through the grant include:\no Research Engineers working in the Micro- and NanoMaterials and Technologies (MiNMaT) industrial doctorate centre on a research problem defined by their sponsoring company, e.g. design of future commercial X-ray detectors for medical, scientific, security and industrial applications.\no Work on the scale-up of fabrication and novel/reduced cost electrolyte materials for supercapacitors opens up the possibility of commercial exploitation of flow battery technology in large scale electrical energy storage devices.\no Micro-computed tomography facilities are used by external collaborators for imaging of various materials and it will now be possible to attract new collaborations, e.g. with colleagues from the University of Surrey's new Veterinary School and a veterinary practice to assess bone disease.\no Equipment in the Automotive Engineering Group has provided a strategic extension of the equipment base required to attract further research funds in low-carbon vehicle technologies, in particular from industry and through European research projects. \no In the Ion Beam Centre national facility, additional equipment has aided identification of materials with superior secondary electron emission properties, which is important for the design of high resolution detectors for X-ray, electrons and ions. This work has allowed visualisation of the effect of charged particle radiation on living cells and improvement in detection and dosimetry for heavier ions for single cell-single ion radiobiology studies. This is a project of national significance and underpins work with the two new UK centres for proton therapy funded by NHS (?250m). Overall, the items of equipment have significantly enhanced the performance of Surrey's Vertical Nanobeam. \no Activity funded by the grant has also led to enhanced collaboration with NPL, underpinning the participation of Surrey (plus others) in the strategic alliance with NPL and the successful bid to BIS (by Surrey, Strathclyde) for the management of NPL.

The main objectives of the bid were focussed on the development of early-career researchers (ECRs), ranging from postgraduate researchers who are just starting down the path to becoming independent researchers, to holders of named Fellowships, new lecturers or first grant holders. Beneficiaries of this grant are encouraged to use the University of Surrey's tailor-made 'Action Planner Tool for Researchers' (https://researchers.surrey.ac.uk), an online career development tool which helps ECRs and PG students to assess their skills in a number of areas and offers advice and suggests courses to build on current proficiencies. This is complemented by a wide range of training and development opportunities provided by Surrey's Researcher Development Programme, forming part of the University's succession planning strategy. To date, at least one of the post-doctoral researchers who benefitted from the grant has now secured a lectureship at a UK university. The equipment purchased is now being used by a new cohort of PGR students who have succeeded many of the original beneficiaries, building on current successes in the various research groups and centres. Going forward, we will ensure effective continued sharing of the equipment both internally at Surrey and externally with academic and industrial collaborators, using the Academican tool (http://academican.com/).
