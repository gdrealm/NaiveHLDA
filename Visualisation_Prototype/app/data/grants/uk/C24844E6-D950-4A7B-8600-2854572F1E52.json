This project focuses on the Carlisle Indian School, a 'living experiment' organised to prove to white Americans that Indian children could be 'civilized' and educated for citizenship. The school sought to obliterate native cultures and teach children to look, behave and think like white Americans. Carlisle's founder and superintendent, Captain Richard Henry Pratt, commissioned local Carlisle photographer, John Nicholas Choate, to document his project and supply visual evidence of its success. These photographs are as important to the official record as written records and letters, but surprisingly, they have received little attention from historians.\\n\\n'Shadow Catchers at the Indian School: photography, representation and reclamation' will begin with an introductory chapter outlining for readers the theoretical frame of the book and explaining the multi-faceted nature of photographs generally and these photographs in particular. Created to perform a specific function, their meaning neverthless depends on the historical context of their viewing and this has shifted and changed over time. One of the underlying assumptions of my study is that no photograph can be fully understood at any single point in its existence. For example, a picture of an Indian boy, commissioned by white officials to demonstrate to a white audience that Indians were educable, was also sent home to his family to provide proof of his well-being and, more than a century later, that same photograph spanned the generations to supply the only surviving visual evidence of this boy's life at the school for his descentdants. \\n\\nThe main body of the book will be divided into three sections. The first will analyse the familiar before/after pairs of pictures taken at the Carlisle Indian School, as well as hundreds of other photographs of Carlisle students, to ascertain how the transformation process was presented. In particular, it will interrogate how 'savagery' and 'civilisation' were visually constructed through use of the camera, with a special focus on how racial issues were negotiated. The second section will scrutinise photographs of the built environment of the Carlisle Indian School campus --the carefully constructed space where this transformation was to be achieved --to determine how the place where this experiment was conducted was presented to the public (what was being shown and what concealed). The third section will explore firstly, how pupils and parents viewed and used these photographs at the time of their creation; the ways they claimed and adapted them to their own purposes. Secondly, the place Indian families and communities in the twenty-first century have created for these nineteenth century photographs .","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/F005687/1","grantId":"AH/F005687/1","fundValue":"25405","fundStart":"2008-03-01","fundEnd":"2008-06-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  My research has been used in a wide variety of different ways.\n\nIt provided both foundation and frame for the documentary: THE LOST ONES, which has been screened in six countries (see Artistic products section).\n\nMy findings underpinned an international Symposium at the site of the Carlisle Indian School (2012), attended by 290 delegates, Native and non-Native, who openly discussed the sensitive topic of Indian Boarding Schools and their legacies at a time when, in Canada, Truth and Reconciliation Commissions were still collecting painful and controversial evidence (see Collaborations section).\n\nMy work initiated on-going, productive, collaborative relationships between the School of American Studies at the University of East Anglia and both Dickinson College, Carlisle PA, and the Cumberland County Historical Society, Carlisle PA.

Carlisle was a living experiment; a military boarding school organised to demonstrate to white Americans that Indian children could be civilized and educated for citizenship. The prototype for all subsequent Indian boarding schools, in both the USA and Canada, Carlisle sought to obliterate native cultures and teach children to look, behave and think like white Americans. Its founder and superintendent, Captain Richard Henry Pratt, commissioned local photographer, John Nicholas Choate, to document this project and supply visual evidence of its success; over 1,000 Choate prints and negatives have survived. These photographs are primary historical sources and a part of the official record, sharing status equal with written documents and letters. I show how photographs, focusing on student bodies and taken with a specific propagandistic goal, were reframed and reinterpreted by Native parents, by Carlisle students, and also more recently, by descendants of the students.\n\nResearch:\nSmithsonian Institution -National Anthropological Archives \nCumberland County Historical Society\nLibrary of Congress\nNational Archives\nBeinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library My research findings have contributed to and shaped the fast developing field of Indigenous Studies, as well as trans-national discussions of Indigenous boarding schools.\nIn a variety of ways, they have also expanded public understanding of the complex legacies of campaigns to re-educate and 'civilize' Indigenous youth.
