{"id":"2B48B250-D359-4D6D-8BAF-8B0A5ABD34E9","title":"Development of high breakdown, high power InP pHEMTS for millimeter wave frequency applications","abstractText":"Professor Mohamed Missous and his co-workers at the University of Manchester have developed and patented a novel prototype high breakdown voltage (&gt;15V) InGaAs-InP-InAlAs pHEMT (pseudomorphic High electron mobility transistor). These devices, which have been fabricated using Molecular Beam Epitaxy, are ideally suited to millimetre wave applications requiring both high power and ultra low noise, such as defence, security &amp; medical imaging and telecommunications. The purpose of the FOF project is threefold: 1. To design, fabricate and test the new InP HEMT's but at an operating frequency of &gt; 70GHz, which is the required operating frequency for car radar imaging systems and to confirm high breakdown characteristics and thus potential high power. 2. To undertake a detailed market assessment to identify the key commercial applications of the technology, the level of fit between the needs of those applications and the performance of the InGaAs-InP-InAlAs pHEMTs and identify possible licensees for the technology 3. To market the technology to potential licensees or joint venture partners via visits, networking on the conference circuit and articles in scientific and trade journals.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=PP/E00797X/1","grantId":"PP/E00797X/1","fundValue":"90502","fundStart":"2008-01-07","fundEnd":"2009-01-06","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Mohamed  Missous","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
