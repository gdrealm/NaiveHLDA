Third party government in comparative perspective.","abstractText":"<p>The original contributions of this seminar series are (a) to open up informed debate on a major development in the governance and management of UK (and especially English) public policy, namely third party government, and (b) to do so in comparative perspective.Third party government (Salamon 1981) refers to the relocation of public policy formulation and implementation at arm’s length to the institutions of representative democracy.&nbsp; It comprises a variety of institutional forms in which the state acts through intermediary organisations such as quangos, not-for-profits, public corporations, independent regulatory agencies, businesses, and citizen-centred bodies to deliver public purpose.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />The study of third party government opens up questions of democracy, delegation of authority, transparency, and autonomy in the contemporary state.The seminars will draw together a multidisciplinary and international group of academics, together with government and civil society organisations, in a comparative theoretical, methodological, conceptual and empirical analysis of the field, closing with a specifically normative focus on institutional design possibilities for governments and other actors.<br />&nbsp;<br />The aim of the seminar series is to build a new international and multi-disciplinary research and policy/practice community that will take forward the critical generation and evaluation of knowledge about the contribution of third party government to addressing societal challenges.<br /><br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/I002545/1","grantId":"ES/I002545/1","fundValue":"16695","fundStart":"2011-03-01","fundEnd":"2013-02-28","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  Our findings have contributed to discussions of policy and the development of administrative practice in the relationship between government departments, civil society organisations and semi-independent agencies.

There are many ways in which the design and delivery of public policies by business, community and nonprofit organizations can occur. \n\nContracting out of public services is now the norm globally, yet it can have undesirable social and political consequences – especially for marginalised communities. However other forms of third party government drawing on expertise from community organising and co-production can potentially deepen democratic engagement and administrative responsiveness. \n\nWhile the central state is likely to remain the core institution for defining and accomplishing public purposes, evidence from the US and the Netherlands shows that there is much to be learnt from alternative traditions of self-organisation, power-sharing and separate but mutually respectful political institutions. But nongovernmental organizations are not independent of the state. Research from the US revealed that public rather than charitable funding is most important in sustaining a high level of nonprofit activity. The findings of the seminars are being utilised through related AHRC action-research projects and in policy advice projects undertaken with local authorities and third sector organisations.
