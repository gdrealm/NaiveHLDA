{"id":"FC381D79-FDEB-4260-97F9-3D394494BB84","title":"Starlink Manager Grant to support the Centre for Astrophysics and Planetary Science at the University of Kent","abstractText":"In this application we seek support for a 0.6 FTE Computer Manager to support the University of Kent Starlink node and associated PPARC programme computing infrastructure. The research supported by the node is diverse, spanning wavelengths from the millimetre and sub-millimetre to the infrared and optical range. Experimental impact work is also carried out by the planetary science team, that uses presentation graphics and cpu intensive processing power. The group also specialises in millimetre and sub-millimetre wavelength astronomy of star formation regions using mainly SPECX, AIPS, SURF, GAIA and KAPPA for data reduction, and in observational cosmology studies including extragalactic survey science. Theoretical modelling of the observational data is also actively pursued, using both dust and molecular line radiative transfer modelling codes, and bespoke Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics and Photo ionisation codes. During this grant, the system manager will have to support four full time academics (1 Professor, 1 Reader and 2 Lecturers) together with three PPARC PDRA's currently in post plus one Royal Society PDRA. There are currently 9 other research students registered, 3 other technical staff, and 5 other group members. It is expected that the number of postdoctoral staff will increase in the near future / three new PPARC PDRA positions are being sought at this grants round. This proposal continues support originally awarded under the Rolling Grant held for many years by Kent, but now as a standard grant that consolidates all our programmes together. The University of Kent campus has a policy of moving to a wholly to a Windows XP operating system environment and that we have no support for other operating systems (particularly Linux/Unix) / this grant is therefore the only way that we will be able to continue to support access to Starlink hardware/software / and hence this grant is crucial to our continued ability to pursue our already funded PPARC research.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=PP/C000455/1","grantId":"PP/C000455/1","fundValue":"68660","fundStart":"2005-04-01","fundEnd":"2009-06-30","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Michael  Smith","coPersons":["Mark Joseph Burchell"],"organisation":"University of Kent","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
