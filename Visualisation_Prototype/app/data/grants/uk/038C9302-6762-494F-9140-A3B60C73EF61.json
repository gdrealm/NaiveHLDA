Each seminar addressed a different topic, such as energy, security in the hospitality industry, policy and evacuation following a major disaster. Some seminars were video recorded and can be seen at www.lse.ac.uk/complexity (ESRC Seminars). Others can use some of the insights to change policy especially in the energy and security and emergency sectors.
