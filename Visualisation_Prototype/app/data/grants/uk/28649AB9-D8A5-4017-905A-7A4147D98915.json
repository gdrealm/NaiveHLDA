Designed to facilitate the maximum amount of international participation, the seminars will bring together in a 'virtual' forum leading academic researchers and students from demography and other allied disciplines, practitioners in family-centered programmes or involved in the collection of family data in resource-poor settings. Key objectives of the seminars also relate to knowledge exchange and building research capacity through engaging well-established and early career researchers to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>promote interest and knowledge about contemporary topics in family demography internationally</li>\n\n <li>create greater awareness of the strength, scope and opportunities for family demography in Asia, Africa, Latin America and Oceania</li>\n\n <li>foster interdisciplinary academic networking and collaboration involving demographers from different regions.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Further information is on the <a href=\"http://blog.soton.ac.uk/intergen/\" rel=\"nofollow\">seminar website</a>.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J021881/1","grantId":"ES/J021881/1","fundValue":"17070","fundStart":"2013-05-31","fundEnd":"2016-05-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Victoria  Hosegood","coPersons":["Sara Claire Randall","Sabu  Padmadas","Jane Cecelia Falkingham","Maria  Evandrou","Kathryn M.

The presentations, commentaries and blogs can be viewed at:\nhttp://blog.soton.ac.uk/intergen/\n\nWe are planning cyberseminars numbers 2 and 3. These will be run in 2015. We have already been asked to support other research projects by providing a site with which their research materials can be critically reviewed and read by other researchers and partners. Furthermore, the success of the first cyberseminar has led to several other initiatives within the academic, education and practice networks to which we belong also adopting this approach to encourage greater participation by participants in low and middle income countries.
