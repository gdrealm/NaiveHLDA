{"id":"2BE5AFFC-6AFC-4867-9682-FDFBF9FA1D94","title":"Evaluating the effectiveness of the national institutions under the optional protocol to the UN convention on torture","abstractText":"The international human rights community has become increasingly interested in the role of national institutions created by government to promote and protect human rights. Their effectiveness has, however, been questioned. The Optional Protocol to the UN Convention on Torture requires states to appoint national bodies to visit places of detention and make recommendations to governments on measures to prevent torture. This research will examine factors required to ensure such institutions are effective. It will consider how states decide which institutions to appoint, how institutions are likely to operate and how they will interact with bodies established at the international level.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=119221/1","grantId":"119221/1","fundValue":"381553","fundStart":"2006-06-01","fundEnd":"2009-12-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Rachel  Murray","coPersons":["Malcolm David Evans"],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
