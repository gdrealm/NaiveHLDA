We are proposing to observe the simple sugar glycolaldehyde and its isomers in order to understand the physical and chemical conditions in hot molecular cores, sites of massive star formation. Our team previously found glycolaldehyde to be more compact than any other molecule in G31.41+0.31, thereby tracing the densest, hottest inner region of this hot core. Its isomers may also trace these inner regions, allowing us to further probe the conditions at the very centre of the core. Understanding the abundance ratio of these isomers can constrain hot core chemistry and reveal physical conditions and chemical pathways. We are requesting travel and subsistence money for Hannah Calcutt to go observing at the JCMT (note that we have been scheduled in 1 month time and we have only been told few days ago about it).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/L001748/1","grantId":"ST/L001748/1","fundValue":"1774","fundStart":"2013-05-22","fundEnd":"2013-06-21","funder":"STFC","impactText":"  This grant was to support an observing trip for a group member, Hannah Calcutt.
