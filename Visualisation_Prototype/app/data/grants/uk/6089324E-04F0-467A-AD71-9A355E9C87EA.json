They are involved in the provision of core rehabilitative and resettlement services (such as drug and alcohol treatment, employment and training, housing aid and advice) and are recognised as providing a valuable link across the transition from custody to community.</p>\n\n<p>The focus of the seminar series has particular importance in each of the countries represented in this collaboration, where the growing role of voluntary and community organisations in efforts to reduce reoffending has developed as a prominent - and sometimes contentious - issue in recent years. Indeed, in England and Wales this topic has become especially relevant in the context of recent developments around the Ministry of Justiceâ€™s Payment by Results and Social Impact Bond agenda, which has gained international attention as an innovative and unique pilot scheme. The seminar series will be made up of a series of stand-alone events, with each exploring in depth the specific issue devoted to it.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J019801/1","grantId":"ES/J019801/1","fundValue":"21341","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2013-05-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Rosie  Meek","coPersons":["Beverly D Frazier"],"organisation":"University of Teesside","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
