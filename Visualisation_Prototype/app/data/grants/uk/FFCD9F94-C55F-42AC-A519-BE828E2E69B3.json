With BCS data from 2001-2006, this project uses advanced statistical analysis to determine not only which factors (e.g. sex, age, household income) are related to the above outcomes, but also to show if the influence of those factors varies between respondents of different BME status. In other words, it will assess whether being male or unemployed, for example, has a different effect for Afro-Caribbean respondents as compared to Indian or White British respondents.\n<br />\n<br />It will also investigate whether location influences any ethnic patterns uncovered. For example, being a member of a given BME group may be experienced much differently in an ethnically-diverse metropolis than it would in more homogenous areas. As such, the influence that respondent ethnicity has may change by location. This research investigates mathematically these possibilities, identifying various influences over victimisation, fear of crime and perceptions of the CJS, and how they change by respondent ethnicity and location.\n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F00365X/1","grantId":"ES/F00365X/1","fundValue":"76981","fundStart":"2008-01-01","fundEnd":"2008-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Paula Marie Kautt","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
