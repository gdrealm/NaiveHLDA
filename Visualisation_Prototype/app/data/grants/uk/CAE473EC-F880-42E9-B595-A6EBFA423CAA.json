Within the cell, mechanisms sort the components, including proteins, and send them to the correct compartments. Protein sorting is essential for many processes including the control of cell division and correct functioning of the immune and nervous systems. Defects in these processes can lead to disease. Viruses such as HIV take over the cellular machinery required for protein sorting, and use it to escape from the cell. Studies of the yeast cell system have yielded important information on protein sorting, as yeast cells have the basic cellular machinery common to all (including human) cells, and they are fast-growing and easy to manipulate. Our work, using the yeast cell system, aims to understand how one particular cellular protein sorting system functions. The results obtained from this study will provide information about the basic mechanisms of protein sorting which must be&nbsp;understood&nbsp;in order to develop effective treatments for a variety of human diseases.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0601097","grantId":"G0601097","fundValue":"363768","fundStart":"2007-04-02","fundEnd":"2010-04-01","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Katherine  Bowers","coPersons":["Frank Thomas Cooke"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
