{"id":"753B6446-1EDC-4193-87D2-AB794E585FA9","title":"Linking International Macro and Micro Data","abstractText":"<p>In the international data community, users of survey and aggregate data are two very distinct groups that have a tendency not to use both types of data in their research. One of the main reasons for this is a lack of awareness of what inter-related survey and aggregate data is available and how that data could be combined in research applications. These linkages are important to enable researchers to take account of wider influences on individual level responses, to explore how survey data can inform aggregate data research as well as generating new perspectives and research results.&nbsp; </p>\n\n<p>The provision of access to high quality international macro and micro data through ESDS International (<a href=\"http://www.esds.ac.uk/international/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.esds.ac.uk/international/</a>) combined with the availability of multilevel tools means that it now becomes possible to develop a one day course which identifies the potential benefits and issues associated with linking and combining data. The course would be delivered both as a face to face one day course and also made available on-line. The course is targeted at postgraduates and researchers but some units would be of interest to undergraduates.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=PTA-035-25-0020","grantId":"PTA-035-25-0020","fundValue":"76232","fundStart":"2006-03-01","fundEnd":"2007-05-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Keith John Cole","coPersons":["Edward  Fieldhouse","Celia  Russell"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
