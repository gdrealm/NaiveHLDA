Rapidly routinised and normalised, IVF is now the platform technology of a global fertility industry linked not only to a wide range of clinical applications but to the horizon research fields of stem cell science, tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. A stem technique for the 'age of biological control', IVF is also a very personal intervention, intimately interwoven into kinship and family life. It is thus a unique technology offering a distinctive historical case of translational science.</p>\n\n<p>Through a series of three seminars over a two-year time period, the Department of Sociology at the University of Cambridge, in partnership with Christ's College, will host an extended interdisciplinary discussion of 'IVF Cultures and Histories' focussing on the interrelation of three main themes:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>its technological development and visual emergence as an iconic twentieth century technology</li>\n\n <li>the interface between IVF and the media (particularly in its crucial transition stage from experimental technique into clinical practice, 1970-80)</li>\n\n <li>its role as an 'ethical crucible' through which a new 'social contract' was forged between innovative research science and public morality in the late-twentieth century.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L001209/1","grantId":"ES/L001209/1","fundValue":"30327","fundStart":"2013-09-01","fundEnd":"2015-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Sarah  Franklin","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
