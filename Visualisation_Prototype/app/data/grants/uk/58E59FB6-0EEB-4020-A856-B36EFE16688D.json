CANARY has achieved the following world firsts, which are fully consistent with the goals of this funding:\n\nLaser Multi-Object AO (MOAO) demonstrated on-sky\n - this is a technology required for the MOS (Multi-Object Spectrograph) on the forthcoming European Extremely Large Telescope. The technology will allow, for example, a survey of the first galaxies to form in the universe, exploring the mechanisms which give the universe its particular form. It overcomes the effects of atmospheric turbulence on ground-based telescopes and does so over a very wide field of view. Artificial stars, produced by powerful lasers, are used to sense the atmospheric turbulence above the telescope and and to correct its effects.\n\nLaser Tomographic AO (LTAO) demonstrated on-sky\n- this is an atmospheric correction technology required by the UK-led HARMONI first-light instrument on the forthcoming European Extremely Large Telescope.\n\nFull Linear Quadratic Gaussian Conreol demonstrated on-sky\n- optimally removes the effects of windshake on telescope images.\n\nAO feed of a photonic lantern spectrograph demonstrated on-sky\n\noptimal feeding of a new photonic technology spectrograph using adaptive optics\n\nArtificial Neural Net tomographic reconstructor demonstrated on-sky,\n- technology allowing adaptive optics turbulence correction to adapt automatically to changes in the atmospheric configuration\n\nCuReD and HWR wavefront reconstructors demonstrated on-sky\n- new high-speed computational methods for adaptive optics for exoplanet imaging.\n\nMOAO and LTAO are required for the ELT-MOS, ELT-IFU (HARMONI), METIS, and possibly HIRES. This work has secured our position in the MOS and HIRES projects, including the position of AO Systems Engineer and Real-time control lead for the MOS. \n\nThe success of CANARY has secured EU funding (OPTICON) and ESO support for CANARY Phase D (Na LGS Spot Elongation)\n\nWe note that MOAO technology is used in Keck's future NGAO system and LTAO is a workhorse mode of GMT.
