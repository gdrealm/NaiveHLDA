Specifically, I am now working with the two organisations to generate industry specific literature for employers to understand what HR interventions will improve the quality of working life for older workers and facilitate extended working lives.\nOne of the case studies has generate a unique dataset exploring the experiences of older migrants in the UK and employability. The data, generated in partnership with the Hong Kong migrant community group Wai Yin identified several barriers which older migrants face in terms of multiple discrimination, acculturation barriers, and language barriers. We are now working together to develop further projects on second careers for Wai Yin members.

Using qualitative, quantitative and action based research, we are able to show that employer HR policies which broaden choices in terms of working hours, learning, job rotation and health can have a positive impact on older workers' willingness to consider extended and phased retirement options. 2) We have sought to compare age management practices in the UK and Hong Kong. We have found that government in the two countries have taken a largely volunteerist &amp;amp;quot;business case&amp;amp;quot; approach to employer engagement. However, real retirement ages in the UK are rising faster than Hong Kong, in large part because in the former, regulations preventing age discrimination and mandatory retirement have restricted employers' ability to shed older workers.\nIn addition to meeting these two objectives, we were able to add a third in exploring the experiences of older migrants and e barriers which they face in terms of employability in later life. We found that they employment barriers in terms of multiple discrimination, acculturation and language. We also found that ethnic community organisations can play an important role in supporting members back into work. We are now working with the DWP, ENEI and Age Action Alliance to use the UK survey data for employer engagement. Specifically, we are developing industry specific literature which will inform employers about the interventions which will enhance older workers' quality of working life as well as encourage phased retirement and/or extended working life.\nWe have also invited academics from both the UK and China (including Hong Kong) with an interest in age and work to explore the survey data with us through two workshops at Newcastle and Lingnan Universities. The aim is to use the data as the basis for an international network of academics from the two countries with a focus on extended working lives from an East/West perspective. Finally, we are working with Wai Yin to develop further work on employability and older migrants with a focus on the role which community groups like Wai Yin can play in helping older migrants overcome employment barriers later in life.
