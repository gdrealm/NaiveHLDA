Previous research shows that the availability of social networks improves the quality of life of older people. Nevertheless such an approach to social policy can have unintended effects. Informal and family based social care can contribute to the deterioration of the health of carers and disrupt their career. This implies that government must maintain a careful equilibrium between sustaining social network care and providing accessible care services that can work in partnership with these networks.</p>\n\n<p>This research will use multi-variate analysis of secondary data and comparative social policy analysis.&nbsp; A sub set of data will be taken from the International Social Survey Programme (ISSP) using respondents aged 50 and over from 18 countries that are members of the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). </p>\n\n<p>Analysis will explore patterns of social networks.

Respondents from the former group tended to have greater levels of family contact, a smaller number of friends and less likelihood of involvement in social organisations. Social network patterns in Japan, being the only Asian country in the sample, differed from both these clusters, having the highest proportion living in multiple person households, but a low level of contact with family with whom they did not reside. \n\n \n\nIn all countries the majority of respondents (74%) saw a close relative at least once a week, although the country average varied between 89% in Spain and Italy to only 66% in New Zealand. All countries agreed on the importance of the spouse as a source of support although rates of marriage and widowhood varied considerably\n\n\n\nGender differences\n\nAcross all the countries, women had on average greater frequency of contact with family than men, whilst overall men had higher social participation rates than women even when controlling for age. In most countries, men also reported more close friends on average, but paradoxically men were also more likely to report having no close friend, and to see their closest friend less frequently than women.\n\n\n\nAttitudinal variations\n\nThe ISSP included a number of attitudinal questions, including whether adult children have a duty to look after elderly parents. Countries with higher levels of family contact were more likely to have above average levels of agreement with this statement.\n\n\n\nPaid employment\n\nLevels of close family contact were on average marginally lower among employed persons. Working was found to have a positive effect on non-familial social networking, in particular involvement in social and community groups. No evidence was therefore found that working in older life undermines the increased social networking that is often aspired to through retirement and voluntary early retirement. Paid employment was more likely amongst the non European sample, and northern Europeans.\n\n\n\nSocial expenditure on care\n\nA negative association was found between social expenditure on care in countries and the average level of family contact, and between expenditure and the proportion living in multiple person households in each country. However, this association was dependent upon the extreme cases of regimes with particularly high and low expenditure. When these are excluded from the analysis, this association is not evident. On the contrary, to some extent, it can be argued that strong family networks within countries are not necessarily incompatible with comparatively generous public social care provision. Austria is an example of a country with strong family networks accompanied by higher levels of expenditure. Over 81% of the sample in Austria saw an adult child at least once a week, compared to an average of 73% in the 18 countries. Austria had above average OECD expenditure on long term care as a proportion of the population over 80 in 2001 and a developing profile of social care services.\n\n\n\nImpacts on policy and practice\n\nThe research findings illustrate the importance of extending community based social care policy and provision in the UK that is able to support and strengthen local family and community networks. Policy needs to facilitate caring from family, friends and communities, and promote flexibility to support differing situations in accordance with the context and preferences of users. Such policies also need to have a wider ranging impact in term of the proportion of the older population they can assist (as happens in Austria) and not be restricted to small sub groups of the population. Japan, like the UK, has less policy activity to support informal care. Policy makers need to consider the interaction of employment and retirement policies and their impact on caring activities, especially for women. Continued employment has social benefits, but pressures on people to persist in employment may be counterproductive to caring, and put increased pressures on women in particular.
