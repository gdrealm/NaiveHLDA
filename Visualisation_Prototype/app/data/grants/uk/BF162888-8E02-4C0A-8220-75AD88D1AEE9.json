Over the period 2013-2015 we will make high-fidelity laboratory experiments to assess the applicability of adaptive optics correction down to visible wavelengths, and exploit data from vertical turbulence profiling equipment to study the effects of low-altitude turbulence on telescope performance. We will also continue our joint programme with ESO to develop the next generation of real-time control systems for future adaptive optics systems, and undertake a development programme using our in-house manufacturing capability to deliver high-precision large-diameter diamond-machined optics for next-generation instruments. We will explore the application of photonics technologies to improving the versatility and efficiency of future astronomical spectrographs using fibre switches and image-stabilising optics. Our rolled up high energy astrophysics programme will use data from new hard X-ray satellites to study extreme accretion flows around compact objects, and will develop an outreach programme for the next-generation high energy gamma ray facility, the Cherenkov Telescope Array.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/K000861/1","grantId":"ST/K000861/1","fundValue":"1207180","fundStart":"2013-04-01","fundEnd":"2014-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Ray Martin Sharples","coPersons":["Gordon  Love","Jeremy  Allington-Smith","Chris  Done","Richard  Wilson","Timothy Paul  Roberts","Richard Michael Myers","Simon Leo Morris"],"organisation":"Durham University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
