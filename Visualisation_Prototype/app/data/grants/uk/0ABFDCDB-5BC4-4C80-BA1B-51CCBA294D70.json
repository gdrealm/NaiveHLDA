Amongst such changes is vowel prosthesis which involves the appearance of vowels at the beginning of words, e.g. Latin SPINA becomes Spanish espina. The project will explore the operation of the different types of prosthesis in Romance and their likely rational. The associated research will draw on philological finding and linguistic theory, yielding results that will increase knowledge of the history of Romance and contribute to general linguistic.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=111847/1","grantId":"111847/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2006-03-01","fundEnd":"2006-06-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Rodney  Sampson","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
