The capacity for self-governance is commonly seen as a crucial component of moral and psychological maturity, while the cultivation and preservation of the conditions for individual self-determination has been a central ambition of broadly liberal political arrangements. Recent legal developments have reinforced this long-standing tradition while also applying it in novel ways. The right to autonomy (often under the heading 'the right to privacy') has come to occupy a central place in European human rights law and in landmark decisions of the US Supreme Court, while in the UK legislation such as the Mental Capacity Act of 2005 has made key legal and medical decisions turn on the question of whether a patient has 'mental capacity' - the capacity to make a decision for him- or herself. A guiding thread in all this is a conception of what we shall call autonomous judgement: the capacity for self-determination in making decisions.\\n But while these ideas have become familiar at the level of moral and political rhetoric, both in theory and in practice they present fundamental difficulties. What does it mean to be autonomous in the making of decisions? To what extent must an autonomous decision be a rational one? How can or should a clinical or legal practitioner, care-giver or social worker determine whether a particular judgement (as, for instance, about the discontinuation of medical care or the disposition of property) has been undertaken autonomously? Such determinations can have dramatic real-world consequences-in determining whether a patient should be force-fed, for instance, or whether an executor should implement a will. But the proper basis for such determinations is far from clear. Indeed, in what sense can an act of judgement be a matter of self-determination at all, given that one of the ideals of good judgement is that a judge's decision should be determined by the best evidence? \\n Deciding for Oneself is a three-year interdisciplinary research initiative based in the Philosophy Department at the University of Essex. Our fundamental aim is to clarify the nature and value of judgemental autonomy, both for its own sake, and in order to provide orientation for those who must apply this notion-whether as parents, medical practitioners, legal professionals, or simply as citizens. \\n Our approach to these issues is in equal measures theoretical, practical, and historical. A crucial element of our methodology is to bring together philosophers working on the theory of autonomy and judgement with working professionals in the law, psychiatric medicine, and social policy. Philosophical theories can be tested and strengthened by application to real-world challenges, while practitioners can make use of philosophical approaches to find a way through some of the vexing challenges endemic to these issues. Our historical approach in turn holds out promise for illuminating both the theoretical and practical issues. A number of contemporary challenges regarding judgemental autonomy are best diagnosed and addressed with reference to the contested history that produced them. One important element in this will be to engage the critics who have objected to the very ideal of autonomous judgement.\\n Research will be conducted in large part through a series of interdisciplinary workshops, public lectures and international conferences, many of which will be open to the public. Among the research outputs for the project will be a website, 'Green Paper' technical reports, and a curriculum for a Knowledge Transfer 'Master Class' for the dissemination of results. In addition there will be a series of more conventional academic outputs, including a monograph, research articles and collections of essays. Above all, our aim is to cultivate an interdisciplinary network of researchers and practitioners will advance expertise on the challenges intrinsic to the ideal of judgemental autonomy.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/H001301/1","grantId":"AH/H001301/1","fundValue":"327233","fundStart":"2010-04-01","fundEnd":"2013-03-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  1. The Essex Autonomy Project has produced a growing body of interdisciplinary research on the legal/psychiatric concept of &quot;mental capacity.&quot; That research is now directly impacting the conduct of so-called &quot;capacity assessments&quot; by medical professionals and social workers acting under the Mental Capacity Act of 2005, and is advancing the understanding of mental capacity among policy makers and government officials. Both in the UK and in many other jurisdictions, the law distinguishes between those possessed of &quot;mental capacity&quot; and those who are lacking in such capacity. Adults who have the capacity to make a particular decision for themselves (e.g., a decision about whether to accept or refuse medical treatment) generally have a right to do so. But those who lack capacity for a particular decision generally lose that right. This raises theoretical, ethical and practical problems about the meaning of &quot;mental capacity,&quot; about what is involved in &quot;making a decision for oneself,&quot; and about how to assess the ability of individuals to do so. By examining capacity assessments from a philosophical and phenomenological perspective new insights have been drawn from the practical process of assessment and the implications this has for patient consent or refusal of medical treatment. Professor Martin and Dr Freyenhagen have trained psychiatrists in their findings and have undertaken consultative roles with the Maudsley teaching hospital, leading to the development of a richer understanding of the factors involved in capacity assessments. \n\n\n2. This research has led to improvements in the training of health and social care practitioners in the area of best interest decision-making. The research project worked closely with practitioners in the field of clinical and psychiatric medicine, health and social care, the law and the police through a series of workshops and on-site consultancy and produced a series of training modules to help practitioners think through the philosophical and ethical dilemmas of their work. The \n number of practitioners attending workshops increased as the project developed and there is evidence that results from the project being adopted by practitioners involved with the implementation of public policy and the legal standards associated with the Mental Capacity Act (2005). EAP research has clarified and explored questions that arise in the implementation of the UK's Mental Capacity Act. Their research in this area has resulted in a series of engagements with policy makers, mental health advocacy groups, senior members of the judiciary, and social-care, healthcare, and legal practitioners. Through these engagements the EAP has guided and informed policy debate and discussion of how best to implement the legal standard of best interests. The EAP has also deverloped a body of online resources for policy makers and practitioners concerned with the legal concept of best interests decisions. The EAP website hosts Green Paper Reports, Briefings, and Research Articles, each of which present EAP research in a form accessible and relevant to the concerns of practitioners. Feedback from practitioners has been extremely positive, and practitioners have particularly commented on the value of linking practice with current philosophical research and legal case studies allowing them to reflect on the ethical and philosophical implications of their decisions. \nMany of the practitioners who have attended EAP workshops are in a managerial or training position in their organisation and we have received feedback that the ideas propagated by EAP research is filtering into training and developement at a local level. For example: &quot;[The] EAP has been really helpful to me in training. I have revised the training materials to reflect the learning from the workshops and summer school. I train adult 'safeguarding leads' in the application of the MCA. I have revised the materials to raise questions of procedural/ substantive autonomy, particularly in relation to vulnerability. This has helped leads to identify when the safeguarding procedures do and don't need to be triggered. I've had feedback that this helped one social worker deal with a very contentious decision regarding whether or not a woman with HIV should undergo an caesarean. The social worker advocated a decision in line with the woman's expressed values and wishes against the medical team. The social worker reported how the work on value and best interests assisted her. I put this down to a change I made in my training following the EAP workshops.&quot; John Leighton, Social Care Institute of Excellence.

Decision-making capacity (DMC) therefore cannot be assessed without taking into account the relationships in which the decision-maker stands to others in her decision-making community. DMC can never be reduced to neurophysiological categories, and psychological metrics such as the MacCAT(T) run the risk of focusing attention too narrowly on individual cognitive performance.\n\nThe Interests of One and the Interests of Others: The law mandates that decisions made on behalf of a person lacking decision-making capacity must be made in the best interests of the patient. But assessing the best interests of one person often requires that the interests of others be taken into account. It is therefore not correct to insist that the best-interest decision-maker should disregard the interests of others.\n\nHidden Ethical Substance: The aspiration to liberal neutrality meets an intrinsic limit in the assessment of decision-making capacity in persons suffering from psychiatric disorders. Normatively neutral accounts of autonomy, when applied to the challenges of assessing decision-making capacity in persons with schizophrenia or anorexia nervosa, systematically yield &quot;false positives.&quot; The substantial ethical commitments at work in the assessment of DMC should not be hidden, but should be brought out into the open for public discussion and democratic debate.\n\nTemporal Abilities and Decision-Making Capacity: The statutory abilities comprising decision-making capacity are underlain by a set of temporal abilities that vary in the population of persons diagnosed with depression. Loss of temporal abilities (particularly the ability of an individual to project herself into a variety of self-implicating and normatively variable futures) puts decision-making capacity at risk.\n\nAntinomies of Autonomy: The current state of mental health law in England and Wales exhibits a set of systematic antinomies. This should not be seen as a flaw of the legislation; the antinomies in law reflect an underlying antinomial structure at work where the vocations of care are practiced and regulated in a broadly liberal legal environment. The distinction between functional and dysfunctional decision communities needs to be refined and lessons drawn for applying this distinction both in legal and medical contexts, and in distinguishing between due and undue influence.\n\nThe research findings of this project with regard to (a) the assessment of decision-making capacity and (b) the assessment of best-interests, can inform practice and public policy in law, medicine and social care. Our own training activities, public policy engagement, and collaboration with public bodies (including mental health charities) constitute important steps in this direction. Further work in improved training and a revised Cope of Practice to the Mental Capacity Act are natural next steps.
