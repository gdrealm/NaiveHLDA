These conditions are associated with the release into the lungs of substantial quantities of an enzyme called tryptase. This has become a new target for drug development. \nThere are multiple forms of tryptase, prominent among which are the alpha and beta forms. We propose to investigate the degree to which asthmatic patients may exhibit genetic differences in the tryptases they possess. The relatively little studied alpha tryptase will be purified and its properties compared with those of beta tryptase. \nThe pattern of release of tryptases from cells will be studied, and the extent to which they are released into blood or fluids lining the lung examined. We shall carefully investigate the ability of the different tryptases to alter the function of cells to promote inflammation and structural alterations in the lung. These studies should advance understanding of fundamental processes of allergic disease and on the new approaches to treatment directed against tryptases.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0500729","grantId":"G0500729","fundValue":"144940","fundStart":"2006-04-24","fundEnd":"2009-11-23","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Andrew Finlay Walls","coPersons":["John William Holloway"],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
