{"id":"40530501-638F-4BE4-91DD-D7B8D3D90D89","title":"Communities within spaces of flows","abstractText":"The Communities within Spaces of Flows project is situated in a period of public sector spending cuts in which services are stretched and there has been a government call for a return to localism to address well-being needs (Localism Act, 2011; The Scottish Government, 2009). This idealistic desire to involve people in local decision making and community empowerment is at odds with the evolving concept of community where the place related connectivity of traditional communities has been replaced by more dispersed social networks maintained by technology and new mobility patterns. The networks of interpersonal ties that provide sociability, support, a sense of belonging and social identity are now less likely to reside in place and are less able to react to local need. At the same time there is growing recognition of the importance of integrating digital technology and health (Tinder Foundation, 2011) and a need to find new mechanisms to support an ageing population with increasing accessibility needs (Musselwhite &amp; Haddad, 2010).\n\nThe Connectivity and Conflict in Periods of Austerity project has illustrated how those with access to network capital (i.e. the resources, such as cars and mobile technology, needed to sustain and generate social capital) are best placed to exert influence on their localities while others remain excluded. This provides the grounding for this follow-up project with its revelations about middle class political activism and its effects on public services while other groups are marginalised. This poses fundamental questions about public engagement and people's ability to take control of their own well-being. This application for follow-up funding therefore explores important questions about technological interventions and their role in community well-being, fostering responsibility for place and local connectivity. The project will reflect on the fit of a combination of AHRC Connected Communities funded technologies, in addition to a collaborative travel App developed by the Sixth Sense Transport project (EPSRC Digital Economy funding, EP/J004650/1) (Davies et al. 2012), to extend and enable place based community support networks to obtain health and well-being gains. The project builds on the previous good working relationship with Wester Hailes and considers how the work of the Connected Communities groups might complement the more traditional patient/GP relationship and help produce measurable improvements in health.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/L013258/1","grantId":"AH/L013258/1","fundValue":"31975","fundStart":"2014-02-01","fundEnd":"2014-10-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  Although the project was comparatively short (6 months) the field study and subsequent findings have proven critical for a series of next steps:\n\n1. The research revealed a difficulty in fostering reciprocity in social networking platforms that involve material / physical exchanges. People tend to feel indebted to others and prefer not to enter such a debt. This has critical repercussions for the Internet of Things 2.0 which anticipates a social dimension to the objects that will become connected to the internet. This finding has informed a series papers and workshops to explicate this condition. (Dickinson et al (2014) Fundamental challenges in designing a collaborative travel app. Transport Policy; Speed et al (2014) Locating the Flow, ISEA 2014; Dickinson et al (2014) Communities within Spaces of Flows: a breakout session using the LinkLocal smartphone app to move objects around the city. AHRC Connected Communities Festival 2014, Cardiff 1-3 July)\n\n2. To better understand the background for the problem of reciprocity within social material networks, design work has begun on exploring how the apparent agency of objects within an Internet of Things might be attuned to deal with this problem: perhaps objects can identify that we need help, and will ask for help on our behalf; designers should better understand the social values at play within a social value constellation to understand how to promote engagement. This question was a guiding force in the development of the Exploring incentivisation in design workshop at NordiCHI14 involving participants from a wide variety of fields including STS, HCI, Architecture, Design (Speed, C. et al (2014) Exploring incentivisation in design. NordiCHI 2014).\n\n3. The challenge of developing digital platforms that are informed by a social value constellation that affords a model of reciprocity has become the focus of a responsive mode grant to the ESRC entitled: Reciprocity in the Internet of Things. With a focus upon communities where people need help but find it hard to ask. This will include health groups and communities. The project would explore reciprocity in everyday practices using design interventions involving objects and people as actors. Submission before end of 2014.

Historically identified as a deprived area, the study involved working with residents to rebrand an existing iPhone application developed on the Sixth Sense Transport project (EP/J004650/1) and deploy it as a collaborative tool for sharing resources across the community. \n\nKey findings from the study revealed that:\n1. Social networking / logistic applications require a critical mass to work in order to foster models of reciprocity. (Dickinson et al (2014) Fundamental challenges in designing a collaborative travel app. Transport Policy)\n\n2. The trial of a rebranded logistics application for tourism showed promise with regard to community users communicating with one another and sharing information. (Dickinson et al (2015) Collaborative Travel Apps, Reciprocity and the Internet of Things, UTSG)\n\n3. There was a significant bias in the community to offer help rather than ask for help. However altruistic, this bias inhibits the flow of sharing within a network. (Dickinson et al (2015) Collaborative Travel Apps, Reciprocity and the Internet of Things, UTSG)\n\n4. Incentive schemes can fail if there are perceived conflicts in the value of participation. The trial worked with members of the community Time Bank scheme who were upset by introduction of financial incentives which in conflict with the ethos of the Time Bank. (Hibbert et al (2014) Exploring incentivisation in design, NordiCHI14) 1. Reciprocity: The trial corroborated evidence that the team has identified in the Sixth Sense Transport project (EP/J004650/1) that when offered a platform for sharing, communities in the UK are extremely keen to offer help to fellow residents, but deeply reticent to ask for help. This finding offers a critical finding to inform the development of digital projects, services and platforms that rely on a model of reciprocity in which asking for help should be equal to offering help. \n\n2. Incentives: In an effort to instigate more offers of help, the team introduced an incentive scheme that would reward participants (both helper and person in need of help) if a transaction had taken place. Whilst evidence of financial incentives had proven their effectiveness in other field studies, the use of money to promote exchange was found to be insulting to the participants who had signed up to the trial though the local Time Bank. It was felt that financial incentives were not in the spirit of the project, and peoples time and involvement were based upon the ethos of the Time Bank. This finding proved valuable at the Exploring incentivisation in design workshop at NordiCHI14 and will be explored further though a subsequent publication that explores how the design community should consider how to design through value (ACM Interactions, Spring 2015 in preparation.)
