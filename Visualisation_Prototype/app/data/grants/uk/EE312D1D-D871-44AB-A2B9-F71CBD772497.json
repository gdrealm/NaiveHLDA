As part of this collaboration the response of a filamentous fungus (Aspergillus) to growth on a variety of carbon feed stocks has been examined through analysis of the genes that the fungus expresses. This has shown that the fungal response is substrate specific a finding that may have implications for the use of these feed stocks as sources of bioenergy. Since the fungal response to different feed stocks appears to be substrate specific this implies that these results could be used by the bioenergy industry to develop tailor made enzyme cocktails for the breakdown of different substrates and thus improve the efficiency of the bioenergy production process Agriculture, Food and Drink,Energy","dataset":"gtr"}
