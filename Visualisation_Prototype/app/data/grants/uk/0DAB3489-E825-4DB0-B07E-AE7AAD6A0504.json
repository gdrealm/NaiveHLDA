{"id":"0DAB3489-E825-4DB0-B07E-AE7AAD6A0504","title":"Nu Views","abstractText":"The aim of our project is to develop a new type of hand-held camera combining gamma ray and optical imaging, (which we have called the 'NuViews') particularly suited to intra-operative use. We aim to construct a laboratory prototype system, suitable for preliminary tests in the clinical environment, and will commission a market assessment to clarify the future commercialisation and generation of new IP. The successful project will have two main deliverables: a) A working laboratory prototype camera that can be further developed towards a full commercial system and b) a clear understanding of the commercial market. From this strong position the technology will have a clearly identified route to market and an increased potential for future commercialisation and generation of new IP.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/I003274/1","grantId":"ST/I003274/1","fundValue":"117950","fundStart":"2011-11-28","fundEnd":"2013-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"John Ernest Lees","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Leicester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
