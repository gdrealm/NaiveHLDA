It will 3D scan Greek and Roman mask miniatures relating both to comedy and tragedy, and reproduce them at life-size by rapid prototyping. The project will use 3D motion capture to record experimentation with these masks practitioners of Asiatic and European traditions, and will situate the results in 3D modelled ancient theatre spaces.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=119391/1","grantId":"119391/1","fundValue":"312496","fundStart":"2006-03-01","fundEnd":"2009-10-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Richard  Beacham","coPersons":["Hugh  Denard"],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
