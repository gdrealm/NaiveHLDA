{"id":"400AD967-5287-4D46-B1B8-807144F593E2","title":"Expanding the ComBase database and developing new tools for its modelling toolbox","abstractText":"The ComBase DATABASE hosts tens of thousands of records. One record represents a growth or survival curve of a foodborne pathogen in a given environment. This environment is characterised primarily by temperature, pH, water activity; but also by other secondary factors like atmosphere, additives, etc. The data were from either the scientific literature or donated by food microbiology laboratories. Using mathematical modelling and programming techniques, software tools have been written at IFR and implemented in the MODELLING Toolbox of the ComBase web site. Help and TRAINING systems were developed to provide the necessary guidance on how to use these tools and interpret their outputs. In this proposal, we would add more datasets to ComBase. The nature of these new data will also be more complex: they will include data obtained when environmental factors change during the observation time. This dynamic environmental factor can be either the temperature (e.g. during thermal treatment), water activity (e.g. during drying after manufacturing) or pH (e.g during fermentation). Many such datasets are already available in large quantities (ca 5000 records) via our collaborators, but their re-formatting for the ComBase format, verification, processing and modelling needs computational and mathematical expertise.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/G022674/1","grantId":"BB/G022674/1","fundValue":"238308","fundStart":"2009-09-01","fundEnd":"2012-08-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The database which is the basis of the ComBase system (www.combase.cc) has been enhanced by ca 20%.

The highly accessed www.combase.cc hub not only provides users access to raw data but also MODELLING tools to analyse those data and using the gained information for research (academia), formulating safer foods and food processing environments (industry) and risk assessment (regulation).\n\nHELP and TRAINING systems were developed to provide the necessary guidance on how to use these tools and interpret their outputs.\n\nIn this project, we added more data to ComBase. Besides, their nature can now be more complex: they can include those observations when environmental factors changed during the observation time. This dynamic environmental factor can be either the temperature (e.g. during thermal treatment), water activity (e.g. during drying after manufacturing) or pH (e.g. \nduring fermentation).\n\nThe web site was also put on a technically more sophisticated and sustainable basis. The database was transferred to a modern organisational platform (SQL); partners can now add information to the web site, and the the applied mathematical modelling tools are also more sophisticated. The IMPACT of the database doubled during the three years of the project, either in terms of the number of visitors on the web site or the number of trainees on ComBase workshops, or the citation in scientific literature.
