This project conducted by Prof Neil J Mitchell, University of Aberdeen, and Dr Sabine Carey, Nottingham University, will fill this gap in the study of conflict, human rights violations and government agents by establishing an extensive database on pro-government armed groups, militias, irregulars, death squads and paramilitaries. The data will be collected using electronic databases and documents in the British Library and SOAS Library on pro-government armed groups across all countries from 1981-2007.&nbsp;The quantitative and qualitative analyses will contribute to our understanding of the role of accountability, the importance of the choice of agent in conflict and human rights violations and the conditions under which these groups form and fail. In addition, by focusing on these organisations, the project will enable researchers and policymakers to obtain a more comprehensive estimate of the repressive apparatus of a country than that provided by relying on the size of formal security forces.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E011756/1","grantId":"ES/E011756/1","fundValue":"180741","fundStart":"2007-09-01","fundEnd":"2009-11-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Neil  Mitchell","coPersons":["Sabine  Carey"],"organisation":"University of Aberdeen","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
