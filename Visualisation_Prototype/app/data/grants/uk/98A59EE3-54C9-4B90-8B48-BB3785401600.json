In its milder forms, in fact, an absence seizure may simply consists of a sudden and brief interruption of consciousness (i.e. the sufferer appears to be ?absent? from surrounding activities) and some minor facial, arm or leg movements, explaining why almost up to the middle of the last century this disease went largely undetected and often unrecognized as a proper neurological disease. Absence epilepsy is a genetic condition that can occur in children as young as 2 years of age. In milder cases, seizures may spontaneously disappear in the late teens, but in the vast majority of severe cases they can occur up to 200 times per day, and are accompanied, or develop into, convulsive epilepsy. Whereas there are medicines capable of abolishing or reducing the daily frequency of absence seizures, their use is not effective in all sufferers, is associated with a number of unwanted side-effects (particularly in children), and is not advisable in women of child-bearing age. While pro-active counselling of partners from families with a history of absence seizures has been welcome worldwide, our ability to cure this disease, and thus to reduce its educational, developmental and financial burden, is compounded by the large number of different genetic mutations that are responsible for this disease and by our poor understanding of the intricate brain alterations that lead to the expression of these seizures. This project, will aim to characterize the way communications between different types of specialized cells in the brain (called neurons) alter their electrical activities during absence seizures. We will focus on two areas of the brain (called the cortex and the thalamus) that have been shown by non-invasive imaging of epileptic patients to be the key regions where absence seizures originate. Moreover, we will investigate whether the passage of calcium ions through specific pores in these neurons is of importance for setting in motion the abnormal electrical events that lead to absence seizures. This research will potentially lead to novel avenues of therapeutic intervention for absence seizures, and partly fill the gap left by the lack of support from the private sector due to the small size of the market for novel drugs for this disease compared to the neurological disorders of old age.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0900671","grantId":"G0900671","fundValue":"336040","fundStart":"2009-11-01","fundEnd":"2012-10-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Vincenzo  Crunelli","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
