{"id":"4DEADD34-A37A-4597-9171-9CB3F4B31E72","title":"Understanding the effect of public policy on fertility: Secondary data analysis","abstractText":"<p>In the light of falling birth rates, this project asks whether government policy can have an influence on fertility decisions. It will do so by looking at the effect of recent government reforms (the introduction of working families tax credit and the child tax credit) that increased financial support for children.&nbsp;While the stated objective of these reforms was to reduce child poverty, they also changed financial incentives to have children – and did so differentially across different households.</p> \n<p>To set recent changes in context, the project will first use a time-series of cross-section data from the Family Expenditure Survey (1968-2002) to document key trends in fertility over time. In particular, it will look at cohort patterns in fertility by mother’s education.</p> \n<p>Secondly, the research will use data from the Labour Force Survey and the British Household Panel Survey to examine the effect of recent reforms, comparing changes in fertility before and after the reforms across the differentially-affected groups in the population.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-163-25-0018","grantId":"RES-163-25-0018","fundValue":"46259","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2006-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Sarah Louise Smith","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
