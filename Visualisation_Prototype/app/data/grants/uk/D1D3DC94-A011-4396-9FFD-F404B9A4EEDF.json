Forecasting models are developed based on different assumptions about the economic structure and the statistical properties of the macroeconomic data.</p>\n\n<p>Recently, structural models, called Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium, became popular in central banks as a tool to deliver both macroeconomic forecasts and policy analysis. However, the academic literature provides evidence on the shortcomings of these models in predicting the drop in output observed in the recent recession. In contrast, academics have argued that a statistical model, called Dynamic Factor Model, may have being able to predict the severe downturn. Additional competitors recently proposed in the literature are Bayesian Vector Autoregressions and Mixed Data Sampling Models.</p>\n\n<p>However, little is known about the relative performance of these state-of-art models when forecasting under macroeconomic uncertainty. From the point of view of the economic decision maker, it is hard to ascertain if the most adequate set of forecasting models (or a model) is being used.</p>\n\n<p>The main output of this research project is a evaluation of the relative forecasting accuracy of state-of-art macroeconomic forecasting models, including their performance during the recent downturn.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K010611/1","grantId":"ES/K010611/1","fundValue":"323312","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Ana B Galvao Soares Ferreira","coPersons":["Andrea  Carriero","George  Kapetanios"],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
