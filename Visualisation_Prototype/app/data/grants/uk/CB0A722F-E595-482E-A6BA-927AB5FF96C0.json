For example, if a subject watches a flashing screen the areas that process visual information respond, leading to an increase in blood flow. FMRI is extremely powerful because it is completely non-invasive and allows the repeated study of participants. However, it has two main drawbacks: it is an indirect marker of brain function, reliant on blood flow rather than electrical activity, and it is slow, since the changes in blood flow take several seconds to occur. This is much slower than the dynamic processing of the brain itself, as can be seen by attaching electrodes to the scalp and measuring the electric fields produced by the firing of active cells, a technique called electroencephalography (EEG). EEG shows that that the brain changes state on a timescale of milliseconds. So although fMRI is very powerful for locating which brain regions are involved in a task, more detailed information about the order in which they respond cannot easily be revealed.One way around this problem is to combine fMRI with EEG (EEG-fMRI), recording from electrodes while in the scanner. It is only in the last few years that the equipment and methods of analysis have been developed to accomplish it safely and effectively. The benefit of EEG-fMRI, compared with either technique alone, is that accurate timing and spatial information are both available, potentially providing a much more complete view of brain function. EEG-fMRI is increasingly widely used, but many questions remain to be answered, particularly concerning the best way to combine the two data sets. Until recently, EEG and fMRI data were usually averaged separately and compared across experimental conditions. However, a new method takes advantage of the variability that is observed in the EEG signal from stimulus to stimulus and uses it directly to integrate EEG and fMRI. Initial studies have shown considerable advantages over the standard analysis, consistent with previous work in EEG using categorisation and grouping of responses which suggests that a considerable amount of physiologically useful information is lost by averaging. This approach can also help to characterise more fully the relationship between EEG and fMRI themselves, which has been addressed using electrodes placed within the brains of anaesthetised animals, but which requires further validation in awake humans. The research not only has project-specific scientific goals, but also general methodological goals, relevant to the broad neuroscience community. The aim is to examine the relationship between EEG and fMRI responses to individual sensory events, focusing on the development of improved methods to understand the causes of variability in the response to repetitive stimuli, and hence improving characterisation of the dynamic function of the human brain. The project will perform four separate experiments using visual, auditory, motor and pain stimuli in order to characterise differences due to sensory modality, capitalising on inherent differences in the temporal dynamics of responses to constrain modelling methods. New analysis methods will be applied that utilise more fully the information available in the EEG and allow examination of its correlates in fMRI. The development of new techniques to utilise small differences in the brain's response from stimulus to stimulus is crucial to pinpoint the when and where of brain function, and in the future will open up new avenues of research to study more complex cognitive functions, such as learning, and brain diseases. This project will lay the groundwork that is necessary to understand the link between the two most widely available non-invasive techniques for studying the human brain, as well as providing insights into the way in which basic sensory information is processed.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F023057/1","grantId":"EP/F023057/1","fundValue":"452943","fundStart":"2008-03-01","fundEnd":"2011-02-28","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  We demonstrated news ways in which the brain imaging technique EEG-fMRI could be used to explore brain function. In particular, our publications highlighted new methodological techniques for acquiring and analysing the data, with a particular focus on understanding inter- and intra-individual variability. This is a relatively new topic for brain imaging, and one that is particularly relevant in the clinical domain, where decisions need to be made about individual patients and not groups. We are working with clinical collaborators at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham and the Barberry National Centre for Mental Health to apply these techniques in patient populations, particularly in those with epilepsy, but also sleep and neuropsychiatric disorders.

EEG-fMRI is a very promising technique which has the potential to provide much greater detail about how the brain responds to internal or external stimuli than other existing methods, or either of the techniques in isolation.The project addressed and provided new insights and tools associated with the two main challenges which which must be overcome before EEG-fMRI achieves its potential. \n\n\n\nOn the one hand, recording EEG in the MRI scanner introduces arefacts and makes the data considerably more noisy. This makes intepretation difficult and prevents successful combination of the EEG and fMRI data. We introduced a new method for cleaning the data, functional source separation (FSS). FSS is a semi-blind source separation technique which is able to identify the brain sources responsible for a particular part of the scalp EEG signal. We demonstrated (Porcaro et al 2010) that FSS out-performs other common methods for artefact removal. Furthermore, we showed (Porcaro et al 2011) that FSS can be used to investigate the relationship between different parts of the EEG signal, which may help to shed light on their respective links with fMRI. This work was subsequently supported by a Royal Society grant.\n\n\n\nSecondly, even with clean EEG data it is not clear how to integrate EEG and fMRI to achieve a better method, or how the two signals relate on a trial-by-trial basis. We looked to tools based on information theory, which have previously been used to characterise invasive electrophysiological signals, and provided a new conceptual framework for EEG-fMRI integration (Ostwald et al 2010, 2011a,b). This has lead to an additional project grant supported by the Hadwen Trust. EEG-fMRI has considerable promise as a clinical tool, particularly in the management of epilepsy and sleep disorders. We are working closely with clinicians on both of these aspects, and the developments we made in the work supported by the EPSRC feed directly into this. We have developed new tools to improve data quality and to combine the data sets, as well as much greater understanding of how these two measures of brain function are related. This is a prerequisite for clinical use. Better EEG data quality and improved methods for EEG-fMRI integration can provide new tools for clinical use, particularly in relation to epilepsy and sleep disorders. We are actively investigating both of these areas in collaboration with clinical colleagues at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital and Barberry National Centre for Mental Health in Birmingham.
