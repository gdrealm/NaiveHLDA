{"id":"7A4A34E7-D385-4BB3-8A73-AA567FD9B8BA","title":"Informatics tools for analysis of quantitative proteomics data","abstractText":"The science of proteomics aims to characterise the proteins present in cells and tissues on a potentially genome-wide scale, offering opportunities to advance biomedical science by identifying changes in the proteome linked to biological function and disease. However, until recently, it has been a largely qualitative science - a protein is either there or not. Techniques are now being developed in labs including those supporting this bid which allow differences in protein levels to be quantified using mass spectrometry as the analytical technique. Unfortunately, the appropriate software tools for processing this information in a simple manner are not readily available to academic groups, and those tools that are suffer from problems (they are specific to one technique, difficult to use, and don't write out the results in standard formats for submission to databases). We plan to address this by developing a single software solution which unifies many of the formats and enable or speed up data capture and analysis in this area","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E024912/1","grantId":"BB/E024912/1","fundValue":"99103","fundStart":"2007-05-07","fundEnd":"2008-08-06","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  in the openMS software suite and by users of this tool Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology ","person":"Simon  Hubbard","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":" We developed a prototype software tool for processing mass spectrometry data.
