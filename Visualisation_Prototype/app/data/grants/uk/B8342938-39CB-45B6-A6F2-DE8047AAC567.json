{"id":"B8342938-39CB-45B6-A6F2-DE8047AAC567","title":"Development of new generation handheld and backpack neutron detectors","abstractText":"Transuranic elements like Plutonium are radioactive materials which spontaneously emit neutrons. A neutron detector is therefore a crucial tool to detect illicit trafficking of radioactive materials that could be used to make nuclear or dirty bombs. It is also an important tool for radio-protection at nuclear facilities. Currently most neutron detectors in use are based on Helium-3 gas tubes. The current shortage of Helium-3 means that the supply can no longer meet the demand. \nAlternative technologies are needed in order to replace Helium-3 systems already deployed. This project aims to replace successfully Helium-3 detectors used as hand held and backpack system by a new technology based on layers of neutron sensitive material mixed with highly efficient scintillator. The technology is easily scalable and the design flexible enough to meet a wide range of detector requirements.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/L000113/1","grantId":"ST/L000113/1","fundValue":"93576","fundStart":"2013-07-01","fundEnd":"2014-10-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Antonin  Vacheret","coPersons":["Alfons Josef Weber"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
