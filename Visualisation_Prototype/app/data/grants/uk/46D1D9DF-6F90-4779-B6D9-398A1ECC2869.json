The research draws together concepts from disciplines of political science, innovation studies, and sociology of biomedicine and healthcare, to provide a new evidence base of these emerging developments. Building on the platform of an ESRC Rising Powers Network project, the research focuses on relations between India, China and the UK, in the global context of US, EU and South East Asian scientific and economic influence. Focusing on four case studies, the research will:</p>\n\n<ol>\n \n\n <li>Describe the primary components and directions of China and India's innovation policies, strategies and actions</li>\n\n <li>Analyse how these strategies align with or depart from those employed by the developed economies of the UK, EU, North America, and Japan</li>\n\n <li>Assess the extent to which the Rising Powers strategies engage with, challenge or confirm existing cross-cutting regional and global governance institutions and actions in both private and public spheres</li>\n\n <li>Evaluate the implications for UK policy around these priority strands of biomedical economy and health policy.</li>\n\n</ol>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J012521/1","grantId":"ES/J012521/1","fundValue":"469198","fundStart":"2012-08-01","fundEnd":"2015-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Brian  Salter","coPersons":["Stuart James Hogarth","Alex  Faulkner"],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
