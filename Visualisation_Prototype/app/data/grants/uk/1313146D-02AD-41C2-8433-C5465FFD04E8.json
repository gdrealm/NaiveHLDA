{"id":"1313146D-02AD-41C2-8433-C5465FFD04E8","title":"Nanoscale Imaging of Microbial-Mineral Interactions (NIMMI)","abstractText":"Microbial processes mediate the redox state of many metals and radionuclides, which in turn controls their mobility in the environment and the stability of a wide range of mineral phases. Organics are also influenced by these processes, acting either as electron donors for metal/mineral reduction, or as competing electron acceptors, for example in the case of chlorinated solvents. Advances in molecular ecology, genomics and post-genomic technologies have given us significant insight into the diversity of the organisms responsible for these important processes, and the underpinning physiology, often at a genetic level. In parallel, developments in nano-scale imaging and spectroscopy now offer the potential to reveal how these biological processes impact on the geosphere at an atomic-scale. The aim of this project is to gain a deeper understanding of key microbial-mineral interactions at the nano-scale using a combination of new state of the art synchrotron imaging techniques, including STXM, alongside microbiological, microscopy, geochemical and modelling approaches. Three complementary and interlinked systems of major environmental importance are the foci of this investigation. First, we will address the microbial reduction of insoluble Fe(III) oxyhydroxides, which plays a major role in many coupled biogeochemical processes in subsurface environments, to identify the nano-scale processes controlling this ubiquitous form of anaerobic respiration. Next, we will focus on the reductive mobilisation of As(V) sorbed onto Fe(III) oxyhydroxides, to identify the mechanism of this bioprocess thought to be catalysed by Fe(III)-reducing bacteria, and threatening the lives of tens of millions worldwide. Finally, the bioreduction of U(VI) in Fe(III)-reducing systems, which potentially limits uranium solubility, will also be studied as it has considerable relevance to the management of our existing soil contamination and our legacy nuclear waste, but is poorly understood at a mechanistic level.\nThrough this programme, the applicants aim to obtain definitive evidence to help us understand the precise mechanisms of these important processes, which have been studied for more than a decade by many groups world-wide, but remain elusive. Impact will be across a broad scientific community, underpinning more robust conceptual and numerical models in very high profile areas including contaminant bioremediation, trace metal/metalloid biogeochemistry and the safe long-term stewardship of our legacy nuclear waste. Stakeholder engagement will be through strong links that already exist between Manchester and key centres involved in land and water quality and nuclear waste disposal, in the UK and worldwide. We will also enable the transfer of soft x-ray and STXM expertise from synchrotron facilities in North America and Europe to the UK Diamond synchrotron (beamline under construction), while training of key personal in the UK to make maximal use of these exciting and powerful new world-class facilities.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/J024732/1","grantId":"NE/J024732/1","fundValue":"435359","fundStart":"2013-01-31","fundEnd":"2016-06-30","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  Project is ongoing, and we are developing interactions with a range of stakeholders outlined in our pathways to impact.

This involves making a thin film of ferrihydrite on the appropriate sample holder (e.g. glass for brightfield/fluorescence microscopy or gold grids for electron or x-ray microscopy.) by spray coating or spin coating. These samples can then be incubated anaerobically with Fe(III)-reducing bacteria and later removed for imaging. This system preserves the spatial arrangement of bacteria and so will give a more accurate impression of the bacteria mineral interface compared with mineral / bacteria slurries previously studied.\n \nImage analysis method for automated counting of bacteria from micrographs:\nWe developed a new method for quickly estimating the number of bacteria in micrographs. Previously this has been very difficult, especially in mineral, soil, sediment and water samples due to the turbidity. However we have combined fluorescent labelling of cells with epifluorescent imaging and subsequent analysis using the open source software imageJ to allow monitoring of cell populations over time in previously opaque samples.\n\n Cryo-electron tomography study of metal-reducing bacteria:\nHigh resolution 3D images of Geobacter sulfurreducens cells and associated Fe minerals were acquired using this technique, however there were some difficulties with reproducibility. The samples had a mixture of Fe bearing minerals and bacteria, but in many cases the mineral layer was too thick to allow penetration of the electrons through the sample to the detector and so it was not possible to record images. This is a difficult constraint of applying the technique to mineral samples such that it may not be tenable to pursue this further. Cryo-electron tomography is suitable for imaging bacteria in liquid culture and the results from these samples are very promising and may be useful for another study where it would be beneficial to characterise bacterial nanostructures.\n\nCryo soft X-ray tomography of bacteria\nWe have collaborated with a team led by Liz Duke at Diamond Light Source where they are developing a new microscopy which uses soft x-rays, can produce 3D tomography images and is useful for imaging biological samples. We imaged some metal reducing bacteria using and found some interesting patterns of x-ray absorption in the cells, opening up new research avenues. There has been very limited research on bacteria using this technique and it may have useful applications in imaging environmental microbial samples. We are also working closely with RAL on imaging U(VI)-reducing bacteria as part of a new collaboration with Manchester radiochemists. The system for imaging minerals and bacteria could be used to research a wide variety of iron biogeochemistry questions. Amorphous minerals or sediments could be converted to thin films that would support bacterial activity and then studied using a suite of imaging techniques, combined with chemical analysis to get a fuller understanding of these obscure processes. Likewise, the method for automatically counting bacterial cells from images will have broad application in many areas of microbiology where bacteria are growing on surfaces of minerals, plants, tissue or in biofilms and need to be counted.\nIn the longer term when this research is extended to studying the fate of toxic elements in the subsurface, there will be broader implications in environmental planning, the nuclear industry and in science policy.
