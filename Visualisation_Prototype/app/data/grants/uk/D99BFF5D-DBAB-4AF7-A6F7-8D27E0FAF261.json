{"id":"D99BFF5D-DBAB-4AF7-A6F7-8D27E0FAF261","title":"Rumination, anxiety and neural activity","abstractText":"<p>Rumination is a preoccupation&nbsp;that involves&nbsp;recurring thoughts about possible solutions to a specific problem or situation (Martin &amp; Tesser, 1996). It is considered the cognitive correlate of anxiety, when rumination is excessive, with a specific neural basis (Gray &amp; McNaughton, 2000).&nbsp; Anxious people engage in more extensive analysis when weighing up risks associated with different solutions (e.g., personal problems). Understanding the neural processes underlying rumination may lay foundations for interventions using neurofeedback to reduce anxiety. Such neural processes can be recorded from the scalp using EEG. </p> \n<p>However, there is very little human data that describes neural correlates of anxiety that could be useful in a neurofeedback protocol. Specifically, Gray and McNaughton's (2000) description of the Neuropsychology of Anxiety is derived largely from animal data. Therefore, as a precursor to developing an anxiety reduction neurofeedback protocol, we aim to describe the neurological correlates of anxiety in humans.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-1444","grantId":"RES-000-22-1444","fundValue":"44007","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2006-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Soren Bo  Andersen","coPersons":["Roger Anthony Moore","Philip Joseph Corr"],"organisation":"Swansea University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
