This has resulted in the reform of laws and the creation of new public bodies with a remit to prevent crime. It has also changed the way we do social policy. Many authors feel that we have become too obsessed with crime and its control. There are some academics that think that these changes are very widespread and affect, not only the UK and the USA, but also most other industrialised countries. However, we do not really know the historical experiences of these other industrialised countries regarding legal and policy reform on crime prevention. This research aims to focus on the Spanish case to illustrate whether it has also adapted its response to crime in similar ways to those encountered in England and Wales or the USA. \\n\\nSpain is often discussed as a successful transition from a dictatorship into a modern democracy. Yet we know very little about the development of security policies, the factors that shape them, and the degree to which they have matched international trends. Learning about the Spanish case may give us a better sense of the range of policy choices that are available to us in the UK. For example, the dictatorship past has given Spaniards a very different attitude towards the civil liberties that crime control policies in the UK and the USA often sacrifice for the sake of achieving security. On the other hand, both the UK and the US have devoted a significant amount of their government budgets to testing and experimenting different ideas for crime prevention. In these countries, there is a debate about policy impact that is absent in the Spanish context. Equally Spain is slowly becoming a more diverse country with an economic model increasingly similar to our own. Therefore, a comparison of policy paths taken between Spain, the UK and the USA may be of mutual benefit to politicians and citizens from each of these countries.\\n\\nTo do these comparisons, the author will read the work of Spanish, American and British academics, as well as policy documents from these countries, and consult with policy advisors and other experts. The result of the work will be a book and two journal articles. The author also aims to discuss his results with policy makers and politicians.\\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/H00582X/1","grantId":"AH/H00582X/1","fundValue":"28047","fundStart":"2010-09-01","fundEnd":"2010-12-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Juan Jose Medina Ariza","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
