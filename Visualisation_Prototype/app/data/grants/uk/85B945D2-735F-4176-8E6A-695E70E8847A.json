Once established, depression puts people at increased risk of other medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease and memory problems. In our study we wish to explore the idea that depression and these other medical conditions are linked by increased secretion of a stress hormone called cortisol. We believe that the increase in cortisol secretion happens for many years before the illnesses actually occur. Increased cortisol secretion could theoretically account for why people become depressed and then develop the related medical conditions. If this is the case it might be possible to devise new methods of treatment which would prevent the development of both depression and its medical complications by lowering cortisol before the illnesses have become apparent.\nWe have recently found that young people at increased risk of depression through having a family history of the illness secrete too much cortisol before they have any evidence of depression or any other medical illness. If our idea is correct then we would expect the same young people to have evidence of abnormalities suggesting they are at risk of the medical conditions linked to depression. For example, they may show decreased efficiency of handling glucose (vulnerability to diabetes), changes in the elasticity of blood vessels (vulnerability to blood vessel disease) and smaller volume of a brain structure called the hippocampus (vulnerability to memory problems). This is what we will test in the present study.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0900576","grantId":"G0900576","fundValue":"449443","fundStart":"2010-01-01","fundEnd":"2012-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Philip John Cowen","coPersons":["Zola  Mannie"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
