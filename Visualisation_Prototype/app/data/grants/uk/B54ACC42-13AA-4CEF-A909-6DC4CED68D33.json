After 70 days exposure, although growth was greater in fish raised at the high temperature and CO2, they also had reduced aerobic scope (i.e. reduced capacity to perform energetically costly activities). The aquaculture industry should be interested in our findings, in relation to rearing conditions now and in a future of climate change, and how these may influence early life stage growth, survival and fitness quality of their fish. Our data are also relevant to the wild-capture fishing industry, as reduced aerobic scope in juveniles could translate into reduced survival and stocks of the larger fish desired for human consumption.
