To win observing time on a world-class telescope is no mean feat, as astronomers often propose so many ideas to use these telescopes that there should be more than 5 times more nights in a year than there actually are to execute these ideas. In practice, only the best proposals will be granted time. This proposal requests funding for Leeds astronomers to travel to these world-class facilities and conduct their observations.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/J003018/1","grantId":"ST/J003018/1","fundValue":"35141","fundStart":"2012-06-24","fundEnd":"2014-10-23","funder":"STFC","impactText":"  The grant is to fund travel and subsistence of Leeds astronomers to conduct (competitively won) observations at the world's leading telescopes.\n\nThe research carried out feeds directly into efforts funded by STFC Rolling and consolidated grants awards and their associated impacts.\n\nIn addition, the observations have led to publications, increased\ncitations, while also contributing to\nfuture grant awards.
