{"id":"E04E95F7-7F27-48E4-A62F-AF246323B896","title":"Water at Interfaces Workshop","abstractText":"In September 2008, a successful Faraday Discussion was held at Heriot-Watt University on the topic Water: from Interfaces to the Bulk . The discussion highlighted many of the key areas of activity and dispute concerning the most important molecule on the planet. Three topics that generated extensive and often heated debate concern the structure and dynamics of water at interfaces:(i) water at metal surfaces,(ii) ions at interfaces (in particular the vexed question of whether the surface of water is acidic or basic),(iii) dynamics of water at biological interfaces.As a follow up to the Faraday Discussion a Workshop is planned on January 11-12, 2010 to discuss these three topics and to identify ways forward, through networks and collaborative research projects. The workshop will be by invitation only to leading UK and European researchers in the field and will be held under the auspices of the Institute of Advanced Study at Durham University.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H044884/1","grantId":"EP/H044884/1","fundValue":"7812","fundStart":"2010-01-01","fundEnd":"2010-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Colin David  Bain","coPersons":["Martin Robert McCoustra"],"organisation":"Durham University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
