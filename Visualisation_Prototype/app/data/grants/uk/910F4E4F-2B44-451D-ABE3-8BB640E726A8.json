Many skills improve gradually over time, and a key component of this improvement occurs during sleep. This means one may learn a new skill, like playing a piece on the piano, to a certain level one day and then find one's performance noticeably improved overnight. Important new discoveries about which skills improve with sleep and how such consolidation occurs in the brain have recently brought this field to the forefront of neuroscientific enquiry. These new findings are critical to our understanding of learning and to the development of optimal training strategies. Our research has recently extended knowledge of sleep dependent consolidation into a new domain by showing that temporal skills such as tapping a rhythm can consolidated during sleep. The work proposed here will build upon this finding at behavioural and neural levels. Behaviourally, we will further characterise temporal consolidation and determine whether it occurs for both movement timing and perceptual timing. Neurally, we will characterise the network of brain activity involved in these tasks, show how its function is altered by sleep, and determine how these alterations differ for movement timing and perceptual timing. Brain Networks: When we improve at skilled tasks, the brain activity associated with performing them actually changes. These changes are not all due to improved performance. Instead it seems likely that reorganisation of brain networks can actually lead to better performance, perhaps because it allows more efficient processing. In the past it was difficult to study networks of activity in the human brain because we had no way to measure them. The recent development of techniques for analysing connectivity between brain regions has changed this. It is now possible to visualise the activity of a network and to determine which areas act upon each other and how strongly they are connected. Our work will capitalise upon this new technology to study the brain network used in processing temporal rhythms before and after sleep. First, we will show how patterns of activity associated with temporal tasks are reorganised as a result of sleep. Second, we will determine which phases of sleep are most important for each of the observed changes. Third, we will explicitly test these findings by selectively inhibiting specific sleep stages and checking to see whether this prevents changes in the network. Reactivation during sleep: Studies of the sleeping brain have shown that the areas used to perform a newly learned task reactivate during specific phases of sleep. This reactivation has been linked to the extent of behavioural improvement the next day, suggesting that it is important for reorganising the network. To date, studies of reactivation during human sleep have used a technique called Positron Emission Tomography which has quite limited spatial and temporal resolution. We will study reactivation of the rhythm processing network during sleep using Magnetoencephalograpy (MEG), a technique which gives excellent resolution in both time and space. Because MEG is silent and non-invasive it will allow us to monitor brain activity while people sleep. We will be able to determine whether the rhythm processing network reactivates during sleep, which phases of sleep show this type of activity, and how such reactivation relates to subsequent improvement in performance. Because of the good temporal resolution offered by MEG, we will also be able to track changes in the network as it evolves over a period of seep. Overall, this research will improve our understanding of how skilled behaviour consolidates during sleep. This information will be of immediate practical value for the development of optimal strategies in skill learning.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F003048/1","grantId":"BB/F003048/1","fundValue":"329141","fundStart":"2008-06-16","fundEnd":"2011-07-15","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Penelope  Lewis","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
