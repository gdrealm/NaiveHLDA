Our team uniquely brings together technological expertise with proven UK practitioners in sustainable forestry, combined with relevant local actors and a team coach. Our long term vision is to demonstrate how carbon in forests can be used to aid poverty alleviation in Malawi, and to use this as a model for other developing countries. We will do this using NERC science exploited by UK private enterprise. We will position a team of 4 UK businesses to establish a competitive advantage in forest mapping for carbon management and sustainable forestry. We will also exchange knowledge between Northern and Southern partners, and thus build indigenous capacity as well as UK capacity.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/G524595/1","grantId":"NE/G524595/1","fundValue":"3265","fundStart":"2009-07-20","fundEnd":"2011-07-19","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Iain  Woodhouse","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
