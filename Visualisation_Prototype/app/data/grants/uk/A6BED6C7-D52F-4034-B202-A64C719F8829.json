The processes by which this disease progresses to severe symptoms are poorly understood but with 1-2 million deaths every year from malaria, mainly in children under five in sub-Saharan Africa, their elucidation is a priority. Of the four species of the human malaria parasites, Plasmodium falciparum is unique in being able to promote the attachment of infected red blood cells to cells lining small blood vessels in the host. It is thought that this adhesive property is associated with the development of life-threatening symptoms.\n This study sets out to examine how malaria parasites from clinical samples bind to human cells and to understand the attributes of P.falciparum that allow it to do this. One of the problems is that unlike most pathogenic organisms, P.falciparum is able to stick to a range of host receptors so part of the question being addressed is whether one of these, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (or ICAM-1) , is particularly involved in the progression to severe disease rather than the mild symptoms seen in most infections. \nWith the resources generated from the clinical study we will be able to examine the molecular events taking place during sequestration, leading to the identification of the binding site on the P.falciparum-infected red blood cell and the development of new interventions aimed at preventing severe malaria. By understanding how infected red blood cells and host cells interact, we can design chemicals that will interfere with this process for the treatment of acute malaria infection, but also we will be able to investigate whether children can be immunised against types of malaria parasites that cause severe disease. The latter ?anti-disease? strategy would reduce mortality from malaria while allowing people in malaria endemic countries to still develop the naturally-acquired immunity that protects them throughout their adult lives. \nBoth the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM) and Kenyan sites are commited to the involvement of people from developing countries in research, in terms of technology transfer and education and also in communicating their results to the community at large. Both have a strong and long-term commitment to ?promote improved health, particularly for people of the less developed countries in the tropics and sub-tropics?
