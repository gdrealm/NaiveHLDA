{"id":"B7556BF4-C901-4435-AA0A-A08AFF983D09","title":"Systems training in maths informatics and computational biology (SySMIC)","abstractText":"Amongst others Sir Martin Rees, the President of the Royal Society, has stated that 'the problems of physics are the problems of scale, the problems of biology are the problems of complexity.' This keen insight captures a profound truth about the traditional divide between scientific disciplines. Traditionally mathematics and computing have been powerful allies in the elucidation of the problems of physics but while effective in biology they are not so widely used. For most of modern history the complexity in living systems has not been routinely unapproachable with mathematics and computing - either too little biology was well enough described, the appropriate maths tools did not exist or the performance of computers was too slow. This has all changed recently and now it is time to take maximum advantage. While the BBSRC and other agencies in the UK and institutions around the world have made great investments in specialist research centres it is now time to mobilise the larger mass of UK bioscientists. Biologists of all disciplines, working from the scale of atoms and molecules to that of living ecosystems, must make their contribution and provide their hard-won biological insight to complement the efforts of mathematicians, computer scientists, physicists and engineers who are already exploring the new territory in the emerging discipline of systems biology. To be effective biologists must learn to speak the common language of the physical and engineering science - applied mathematics and computing. They must learn to apply their skills without hesitation and to engage with the other scientific disciplines enthusiastically - SysMIC will start to make this possible. The SysMIC project's over riding aim is to enable rapid and effective 'up-skilling' of a large body of biologists and to accelerate their entry into systems biology and drive the successful study and manipulation of complex biological systems.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I013660/1","grantId":"BB/I013660/1","fundValue":"146379","fundStart":"2011-09-01","fundEnd":"2016-08-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The project educates new generations of researchers in systems biology in the use of mathematics and statistics.

","person":"Uwe Gebhard Grimm","coPersons":["Robert David Saunders","David  Morse"],"organisation":"Open University","findingsText":" The grant supports the development and delivery of a comprehensive online course in mathematics and computational methods used in systems biology. It is being developed by a consortium of researchers at UCL, Birkbeck, Edinburgh and the Open University. The course consists of three modules: Module 1: Basic Skills, Module 2: Advanced Topics and Applications, and Module 3: Project Work. The software used in this course is MatLab. The first cohort of students started on the Module 1 in January 2013, while the second and third modules were being developed. Module 2 has been completed and the first cohort of students has started. Modules are being revised following feedback from students. As of October 2013, over 500 students had entered the course, rising to over 800 by mid 2014. New Moodle tools have been developed to monitor cohort and individual progress. We recently started to convert MatLab code into Python to be able to offer the course with different software. Further plans under development concern finalising module 3 projects, preparing an additional entry module and publishing modules in book form.\nUnfortunately there is no appropriate category in the list of outputs provided by researchfish, so it is a bit difficult to provide comprehensive information using this system. It is conceivable that the material could be adopted by industry for training employees. This possibility is being investigated by the SysMIC consortium. The course is mainly directed at BBSRC-funded research students in the first instance, but may be made available to a wider audience at a later stage. This may include academic institutions in the UK and abroad, as well as the non-academic sector. We are currently discussing plans on how to keep the course running and to develop it further after the end of the initial funding period.
