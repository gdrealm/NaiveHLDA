In terms of psychological processes, the methods employed will reveal a fine-grained temporal structure of these basic components of reading. Although computationally complex, the proposed approach relies on key features which contrast with traditional techniques and which provide greater statistical reliability. </p>\n\n<p>There are novel findings which can only be obtained by using this methodology. First the results will help to discriminate current and contentious hypotheses about how a reader's visual attention is allocated during reading (serial versus parallel). Second the results will provide a detailed time course of eye movement motor programming. Finally the results will further inform theories of reading and reading disorders. From a neuroscience perspective, this approach will help reveal the cerebral dynamics of natural reading.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-1900","grantId":"RES-062-23-1900","fundValue":"226624","fundStart":"2010-02-09","fundEnd":"2012-08-08","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Sara Crescentia Sereno","coPersons":["Guillaume Alexis Rousselet","Cyril Raymond Pernet"],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
