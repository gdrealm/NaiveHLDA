The Southampton expertise will enable the assembly, for the first time, of an integrated device consisting of microlitre sampling, integrated advanced microfluidic and electrochemical sensing systems, wireless communications and the capability for targeted remediation (fluidic control and/or chemical inhibition) at corrosion affected areas. In addition, the device will be able to perform self-diagnostics to ensure judicious maintenance.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F004362/1","grantId":"EP/F004362/1","fundValue":"840232","fundStart":"2008-01-01","fundEnd":"2011-06-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Thick film sensor developed in this project have been used to apply and be award a BBSRC grant - Robust, Ion-Selective Thick-Film Sensors for Long-Term Field Deployment BBSRC value &pound;125000 ref BB/J021210/1 Healthcare Cultural,Economic","person":"Robert James Knoyle  Wood","coPersons":["Nick  Harris","Julian  Wharton"],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
