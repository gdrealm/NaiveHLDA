Improvements in quality and delivery of information from the 2011 Census The project has directly influenced some aspects of ONS policy and practice to improve their management and delivery of information from the 2011 Census. Examples include the use of simpler and more consistent categorisations of variables, retention of cell numbering within census table frameworks and data outputs, and the production of bulk outputs to a widely accepted text format, rather than an obscure SDMX variant as originally proposed by ONS. These improvements will benefit users of 2011 census information across all sectors including the academic/scientific sector, and achieve impacts in greater and better quality research and decision making based on its use. These impacts also extend to 2011 census outputs produced by the other UK census agencies through ONS' lead. InFuse 2011 The benefits of InFuse 2011 described previously now extend beyond the academic sector following its launch in July 2013 as a public service. This has extended the range of impacts that InFuse 2011 is able to achieve by making the 2011 census aggregate outputs easier to find, understand and use to everyone.

The project will continue to achieve indirect impacts on all users and uses of 2011 census aggregate information due to its influence on improvements in the quality and delivery of the aggregate outputs from the 2011 Census. InFuse 2011 continues to be provided as a public service by the UK Data Service.
