The process involves matching the speed of the eye to that of the target, thereby minimizing movement of the image on the retina and reducing blur. Such anticipatory movements are essential to allow us to overcome delays in visual processing, which otherwise impair tracking ability. Previously, we have shown how such anticipatory movements may be generated by using repeated presentations of identical motion stimuli. This creates a high expectancy of impending target motion and allows smooth anticipatory movements to be developed. The velocity of these anticipatory eye movements is proportional to future target velocity, implying that working memory is used to temporarily store velocity information gleaned from prior experience. Similar anticipatory tracking movements of the head have been found when tracking with head and eyes together. \nAll our previous work in this area has been confined to tracking simple movements along the horizontal axis. In the proposed experiments we plan to investigate how the system operates in more realistic conditions where objects move horizontally, vertically and toward or away from the observer. We will investigate how the brain develops anticipatory control of head and eye movements. We will also determine which areas of the brain are involved in the storage and generation of anticipatory movements by using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to record brain activity as human subjects carry out predictable and non-predictable tracking tasks with the eye. In particular, we intend to investigate brain activity when tracking a sequence of such movements in which each component has different speed and direction. Sequence learning is a simple form of motor programming that allows subjects to learn repetitive sequences of movements, such as typing. We have found previously that subjects can learn to generate anticipatory movements to sequences during simple horizontal movement after only one or two presentations, but we expect that when the sequences involve both horizontal and vertical movements more repetitions will be required, because this places greater demands on working memory. \nGenerating anticipatory activity is fundamental to normal motor behaviour and is often disrupted in patients with motor disorders such as Parkinson?s disease or cerebellar degeneration. Findings from the proposed experiments will provide greater understanding of motor control and thus lead to improvements in diagnosis, monitoring of drug treatment and rehabilitation.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0601572","grantId":"G0601572","fundValue":"549945","fundStart":"2007-10-29","fundEnd":"2010-12-28","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Graham Robert Barnes","coPersons":["Stephen Ross Williams"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
