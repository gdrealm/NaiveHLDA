{"id":"6BEF7CDC-D240-4207-AE8F-6F13F8B72818","title":"Spatio-Temporal Systems Estimation, Modelling and Analysis","abstractText":"Systems where the dynamics at any point depends upon the dynamics back in time and the dynamics at neighbouring spatial locations are ubiquitous. These space-time or spatio-temporal systems represent an enormous class of highly complex dynamical systems that have been largely ignored in studies to date. It is the spatial interactions over a neighbourhood of influence that together with the temporal dynamics combine to produce evolving patterns of complex interacting behaviours. Real life examples of spatio-temporal systems are easy to find and range from neuro-imaging applications to stem cells and reaction diffusion systems. The main objective of this research study will be to derive generic systems identification and parameter estimation based procedures to identify models of these complex systems, to develop model validation methods for this model class, to investigate characterisation based on invariant dynamic measures, and to apply the results to a range of both simulated and real spatio-temporal systems.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G042209/1","grantId":"EP/G042209/1","fundValue":"480313","fundStart":"2010-01-04","fundEnd":"2014-06-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  We have applied our algorithms to several real systems including neutrophil, stem cells, crystal growth and several others with great success.
