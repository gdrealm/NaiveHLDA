Even systems with relatively few components might be so complex that their properties can be calculated neither analytically nor numerically. Moreover, even experiments may yield little information about the systems. This becomes even more dramatic if many particle systems are considered, e.g. condensed matter systems such as electrons in a metal. In particular, if interactions between the particles are strong, the quantum properties are very difficult to determine and to characterize experimentally and theoretically.One approach to gain information about complex quantum systems which are not easily accessible is to mimic - or simulate - them. Here, the original system parameters are replaced by ones which can be more precisely monitored and manipulated. In recent years it has turned out that gases of ultracold atoms are particularly useful to perform this task. Electric, magnetic and optical fields are used to create potential landscapes in which the atomic motion takes place. For example, counter propagating laser beams give rise to a periodic potential which is equivalent to the scenario encountered by electrons in a crystalline solid. Moreover, the interaction between the atoms is tunable by applying small magnetic fields (using the so-called Feshbach resonances). Here, attraction, repulsion or even no interaction is achievable. Ultracold atoms thus can serve as a building block for a quantum simulator of condensed matter systems where the atoms assume the role of the electrons. One major achievement of such a simulator was the study of a phase transition in a gas of ultracold atoms in an optical lattice from a Mott-insulator to a superfluid. In the former case the atoms are tightly trapped in the individual lattice sites whereas in the latter case a non-classical state is formed which extends over the entire lattice.In the proposed work we theoretically investigate a quantum simulator which mimics mesoscopic systems on fast timescales. This interdisciplinary research project is of direct relevance to condensed matter physics, molecular physics and ultracold chemistry. It will deepen our understanding of physical processes that take place in molecules, clusters and small spin chains. The basic building-block of the quantum simulator comprises atoms or ions held in traps with a spacing of several micrometers - large enough for laser beams to intreract with (address) individual atoms. In this simulator, the ultracold atoms define an underlying lattice structure in which the electronic dynamics takes place. This is directly analogous to a crystalline solid or a molecule. However, unlike in a 'conventional' molecule individual nuclei can be manipulated.The aim of the project is to explore these systems, to characterize their properties and to illuminate their potential to simulate mesoscopic systems. This opens a doorway to direct monitoring of fundamental physical processes, such as charge transfer, which normally take place hidden from the observer's eye. A key feature of the proposal is a strong interaction with the experiments.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H024069/1","grantId":"EP/H024069/1","fundValue":"100979","fundStart":"2010-04-19","fundEnd":"2011-10-18","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  This is basic research and the findings have impact on the current developments of research on atoms in highly excited states.

In the laboratory such systems are routinely prepared and recent results have offered a spectacular perspective on the workings of quantum mechanics in many-body systems.\n\nThe aim of this research was to theoretically study ensembles of atoms and ions that are arranged on a regular lattice. For atoms such lattices can be achieved by using tailored laser beams. In the case of trapped ions the Coulomb repulsion of equally charged particles naturally leads to an almost regular ordering within a trap, provided that the temperature is sufficiently low. \n\nBoth setups are particularly well-suited for the implementation of spin systems which are ubiquitous in condensed matter physics and which are central for our understanding of a number of natural phenomena, e.g., magnetism. Each atom or ion translates directly into one (effective) spin degree of freedom. In the scenario subject to this research an interaction between two spins is achieved by laser-exciting two atoms to a high-lying electronic (Rydberg-)state. In these states electrons encircle the nucleus on a large orbit which leads to a huge displacement between the two opposite charges. In the simplest scenario this results in a van-der-Waals interaction which can easily be a million times stronger than that between two ground state atoms.\n\nThis strong interaction induces a pronounced collective behaviour where the atoms/ions do no longer behave as individuals but show strong correlations. The simplest consequence is the so-called Rydberg blockade which inhibits the simultaneous laser-excitation of nearby atoms/ions and induces a correlation hole, i.e. each excited atom/ion must be neighboured by a non-excited ones. While for two particles this is easy to understand, the exact quantum mechanical description of a many-body system becomes forbiddingly complex. In the course of the research project we discovered an exact analytical solution for the ground state of this problem in one dimension, which to our knowledge was not known before. Moreover, we showed that an approximately analytical description is also possible in two-dimensional systems, which gave rise to the discovery of a quantum phase transition between a disordered state and a state in which the Rydberg atoms/ions arrange themselves in a regular pattern. The key insight that led to these results was the identification of a connection of the quantum spin models to the statistical mechanics of hard objects on lattices.\n\nBeyond the ground state properties we have also studied the real-time evolution of the above-mentioned spin systems. We found that they relax quickly into an equilibrium state which can be described by a thermal statistical ensemble. In practice such thermalisation is induced by external noise imposed by the ubiquitous coupling of quantum systems to the environment. However, in the calculations such noise was absent which in fact also very well approximates the conditions that are present in current experimental setups. This showed that spin systems of Rydberg-atoms/ions relax to quasi-thermal state even though they are decoupled from the environment. This result is rather surprising but compatible with preliminary results of recent experiment. They shed light on a very timely problem in modern physics namely how many-body systems actually relax to thermal equilibrium.\n\nFinally, we have shown that a setup of Rydberg atoms allows engineering quantum states that can be converted into photons. The photons inherit their properties from the source quantum state. This can be used to generate correlated and entangled photon pairs which have practical applications in quantum communication or precision measurements.\n\nThe research has revealed a number of exciting results which are both of academic interest and of practical relevance. This research line will be pursued further. The findings are being used by other scientists that conduct research on highly excited states of atoms. Other","dataset":"gtr"}
