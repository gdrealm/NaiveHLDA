The way in which we use energy in our homes has been at the forefront of this attention given recent high-profile recognition that it constitutes 24 per cent of carbon emissions in the UK. There have therefore been many attempts to try and reduce the amount of energy used in our homes, for instance, through the introduction of domestic energy-efficiency infrastructure, technology and appliances.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This project will used a mixed method research design, incorporating online methods, to explore the experiences of occupants of low carbon/energy efficient housing to better understand the way in which energy demand is created and, critically, assess how such technology may influence energy use.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K009516/1","grantId":"ES/K009516/1","fundValue":"126616","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2017-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  No impacts as yet. Fieldwork is ongoing hence findings have not been reported  ","person":"Louise  Reid","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of St Andrews","findingsText":" I have developed two new strands of research:\n\n1) Prosumption - this term was coined by Alvin Toffler in the 1980's to characterize the changing relationship between production and consumption. It has gained recent attention to conceptualize phenomena such as user generated content and DIY activities, however, I have increasingly been exploring this in relation to domestic low carbon activities. For instance, might the installation and use of domestic micro renewables be thought of as prosumption? If so, is prosumption a useful theoretical device to explain such developments? How might prosumption also be useful to explain efficiency improvements which involve the householder taking more of a role in managing energy demand? Hence prosumption is an interesting idea for me, and one I got some small funding to explore (see funding - Carnegie Trust). I am currently preparing a bid to Leverhulme for a more substantial piece of work in this area. However, this idea of prosumption does apply to my ES/K009516/1 work in the sense that I have been able to develop my thinking on prosumption through this project. I hope to be able to explore how engagement in production might influence or change the nature of consumption in relation to energy demand.\n\n2) Domestic exterior lights - is a second new area for me. Lighting is the largest demand of electricity in UK homes, yet when one looks at the data, it is often only interior lighting which is considered. With a colleague from Biology, I have been developing an idea around exterior domestic lights. These lights are on the outside of homes and hence the householder pays for their use, however, the electricity demand they create is not the target of interventions (e.g. switching off lights campaigns typically target rooms not in use (i.e. interior lights)). Yet we hypothesise that exterior domestic lights are more powerful and either left on all night, or are triggered frequently, hence there may be important implications in terms of contribution to household energy consumption. We worked with an undergraduate student who was funded via the Society of Biology to do a summer internship with us. We undertook a pilot study where I used a questionnaire with householders to address some of the social science behind the use of exterior domestic lights (finding out about motivations and patterns of use). This is an area I will also be addressing via the ES/K009516/1 project and one which I hope to get further funding.\n\nMy work, and contributions to thinking about sustainable housing has also been recognized in so far as I have recently become a co-director at the Centre for Housing Research (CHR) at St Andrews. I came onboard in the Summer of 2014 and this is an exciting prospect for me. With the other co-director, I manage the research center which has some 20 staff (including researchers and associates) and a diversity of research projects. This has involved the development of new leadership skills, and skills around the financial planning and administration of a research center. We have re-focused the work of CHR, and there is now a much stronger focus on two strategic themes of 'homes, families and communities' and 'places, policies and practices'. My work on sustainable housing will feature in both of those themes and this is an area we hope to grow with a Research Assistant starting in this area in 2014/5. In relation to box 1 above:\n\n1) Prosumption - this is really quite theoretical so findings will be of most interest to academics. However, I think that if the relationship between production and consumption in relation to energy is changing, and that greater involvement in production might make householders think differently about consumption, then that may have wider influences. For instance, practice and policy communities may potentially view energy prosumption as a type of intervention to reduce energy demand.\n\n2) Exterior domestic lighting. This will be of interest to those with a concern in reducing electricity use in UK homes - policy and practice communities. It will also potentially be of interest to organisations such as the police who give advice on lights in relation to security, to safety organisations who are concerned with trips/falls in dark areas, and to retailers/installers of lights.
