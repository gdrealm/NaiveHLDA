{"id":"12EB76D5-2D14-469C-9E09-5B1E13AEEF05","title":"Quantum Suicide: Walter Benjamin and the multiverse","abstractText":"Parallel universes are a familiar theme in fiction. From Philip Pullman to Doctor Who, readers and viewers of all ages have become attuned to the idea of other worlds almost like our own, but crucially different. Often this takes the form of 'alternate history', where a particular event is imagined to have gone differently, creating a new timeline. The idea has appeared not only in fantasy and science-fiction, but also in mainstream fiction and cinema, with examples such as Philip Roth's The Plot Against America and the movie Sliding Doors.\\n\\nModern science appears to offer evidence that these worlds really exist. Physicists including Paul Davies and Michio Kaku have published popular books describing how quantum mechanics and superstring theory imply our observable universe is only a tiny part of a far richer 'multiverse', where every possibility becomes actual. Cosmologist Max Tegmark has discussed 'quantum suicide', a version of the famous Schr&ouml;dinger Cat thought-experiment in which the experimenter takes the place of the animal. Since one's own death can never be observed, it is argued, the only possible result is a universe where one survives. Such speculations sound like plotlines from Jorge Luis Borges or Philip K Dick.\\n\\nHas science influenced art, or has it been the other way round? This research will explore the history and philosophy of multiple realities through the composition of a novel of ideas.\\n\\nSurprisingly, the idea of parallel worlds was put forward in the nineteenth century, in Louis-Auguste Blanqui's L'Eternite par les astres (1872). Blanqui used the theory of atomic elements to argue there must be planets where, for instance, Napoleon won the Battle of Waterloo. A communist who spent most of his life in prison for revolutionary conspiracies, Blanqui also speculated on worlds where he was free.\\n\\nPhysicists completely ignored Blanqui's pseudo-scientific work, but it is remembered thanks to Walter Benjamin, who rediscovered it in the 1930s.Benjamin considered Blanqui's cosmology a manifestation of the bourgeois society he fought against. Capitalism views the world as a casino; the multiverse is a 'phantasmogoria' where everyone can be a winner. In the popular writings of present-day physicists such as Stephen Hawking, metaphors of gambling and winning arise frequently.\\n\\nThe proposed novel will feature Benjamin as a character, but more importantly, it will reflect on his theories of culture, art and history. Through multiple storylines in several historical periods, the novel will explore how ancient ideas of plurality, found in Plato and revived by Leibniz, have been reinterpreted over the ages. In real life, Blanqui was involved in a masonic secret society (the charbonnerie), while Benjamin was deeply drawn to mystical and esoteric thought. The novel will imagine a secret society whose version of 'quantum suicide' leads them to carry out acts of terrorism. Benjamin committed suicide in 1940 rather than face arrest by the Gestapo. The theory he discussed extensively in his Arcades Project was one that implied his own survival, in another world if not this one.\\n\\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/H020470/1","grantId":"AH/H020470/1","fundValue":"13224","fundStart":"2010-01-01","fundEnd":"2010-12-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Andrew David Crumey","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
