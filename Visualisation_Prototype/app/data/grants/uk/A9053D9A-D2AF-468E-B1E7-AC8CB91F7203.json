The new spectrometer will be capable of running 1H, 19F and X nucleus experiments under automation. The new spectrometer will more than double the capacity for routine spectroscopy in the Facility and also allow a much broader range of experiments to be offered. The backoffice infrastructure within the Facility will be upgraded to take full advantage of the capabilities of the new instrument.The instrument will facilitate research in :Catalytic mechanisms, the recovery and recycling of homogeneous catalysts, the synthesis of main group compounds and ligands, mechanistic studies of crystal growth, synthetic organic chemistry, supramolecular chemistry","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D03874X/1","grantId":"EP/D03874X/1","fundValue":"321381","fundStart":"2006-04-03","fundEnd":"2009-04-02","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Douglas  Philp","coPersons":["Tomas  Lebl","David  O'Hagan"],"organisation":"University of St Andrews","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
