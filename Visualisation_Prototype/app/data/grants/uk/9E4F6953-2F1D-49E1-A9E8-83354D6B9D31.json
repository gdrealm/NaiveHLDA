These advantages arise from the simplicity of the SSD single layer, planar structures, which differentiate them from conventional semiconductor devices which are multilayer, vertical structures. SSD's have a number of potential applications ranging from printed Radio Frequency Identification Tags (RFID) to drivers for rollable computer displays and intelligent disposable sensors. The purpose of the project is threefold:1. To design, fabricate and test a SSD based high speed microwave rectifier and antenna for demonstration to RFID vendors.2. To prove the feasibility of manufacturing SSDs by a simple one step nanolithography process which isdramatically simpler than the number of steps used for existing semiconductor technology.3. To market the SSD demonstrators to a number of potential development partners and licensees, and to raise the first round of external VC seed funding.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E502814/1","grantId":"EP/E502814/1","fundValue":"57660","fundStart":"2006-06-01","fundEnd":"2007-05-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Aimin M.
