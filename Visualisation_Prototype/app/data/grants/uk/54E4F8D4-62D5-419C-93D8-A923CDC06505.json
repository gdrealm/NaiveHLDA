{"id":"54E4F8D4-62D5-419C-93D8-A923CDC06505","title":"The role of neutralising antibodies in hepatitis C virus infection","abstractText":"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the major etiological agent of liver disease in most regions of the world. The majority of new infections become chronic and these individuals are at high risk for developing progressive liver disease. However, a minority of individuals (20%) resolve their infection and clear HCV to undetectable levels. We are interested in studying the immune parameters that distinguish these individuals from those where the virus persists. We will study the role of antibodies that have the potential to bind virus and prevent infection of new cells within the liver. Research findings from this proposal with immediate clinical relevance will be translated to the general public by interviews with the local press and through the MRC web site.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0400802","grantId":"G0400802","fundValue":"650000","fundStart":"2006-04-01","fundEnd":"2010-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Jane Alison McKeating","coPersons":["Peter  Balfe","John  Gordon"],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
