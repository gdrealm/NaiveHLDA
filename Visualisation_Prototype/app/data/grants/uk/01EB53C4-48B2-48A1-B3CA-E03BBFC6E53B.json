{"id":"01EB53C4-48B2-48A1-B3CA-E03BBFC6E53B","title":"Balancing the Tensions: Using Organisational Theory to Inform Business Practice","abstractText":"<p>The field of organisational behaviour is defined by a tension in which, on the one hand, academic researchers seek to develop appropriate models to understand organisational phenomena and, on the other, practitioners try to identify “best practice” to improve organisational performance.&nbsp;In practice, though, academic research is often conducted away from the organisational ‘front line’, and management practice is rarely informed by leading-edge organisational science. As a result, theory and practice are routinely out of step with each other, and there is often a large&nbsp;- and disturbing&nbsp;- gap between them.</p> \n<p>This series of seminars aims to bridge this gap by bringing together leading academic and industry figures to discuss contemporary research and business practice and engage in constructive dialogue around key topics that are central to contemporary organisational life:&nbsp; leadership, performance, innovation, and space management.</p> \n<p>Each seminar will address the distinct problems that academics and practitioners face and explore concrete ways in which these can be tackled and overcome. Seminars will be appropriate for stand-alone attendance, but the series will also build towards an integrated understanding of the challenges facing organisations when endeavouring to interpret and apply organisational theory.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-451-25-4271","grantId":"RES-451-25-4271","fundValue":"7916","fundStart":"2007-01-01","fundEnd":"2008-07-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Stephen Alexander  Haslam","coPersons":["Jonathan  Gosling","Richard  Bolden","John  Burgoyne","Rolf  Van Dick","Inmaculada  Adarves-Yorno"],"organisation":"University of Exeter","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
