However, applications like\nlaser drilling requires a positional accuracy around 20-25 microns which is not feasible with existing robotic systems and\nhence is mostly performed using expensive CNC based systems. This project aims to develop a flexible robotic laser\nprocessing system which can have a position accuracy of less than 20 micron, and that can be used for most laser\napplications including laser drilling.\nBy exploiting the speed and precision of modern CCD cameras, the positional error of the robot will be calculated based on\nthe coordinates (of the laser interaction point and a reference point) obtained from the CCD camera. The CCD camera will\nbe co-axial to the nozzle exit. The positional error calculated by the vision system will be compensated by offsetting the\nlaser beam and nozzle position, through a novel mirror and optical assembly.\nThe project will initially undertake proof-of-principle experiments to establish the positional error from the CCD camera\nimage. A new algorithm will be developed to extract the real-time positional error from the CCD camera image and to\nfacilitate compensation of the error by offsetting the laser beam position. National Instruments (NI) real-time module along\nwith a NI CompactRIO system will be used to achieve the required cycle time (less than 10ms). Finally, the CCD camera\nand the software will be integrated with the robot and the nozzle assembly, to achieve a truly flexible manufacturing\nsystem.\nThe immediate application will be on robotic laser drilling of aerospace combustion chambers. It is expected that the\nFlexLase system will be more accurate and affordable than the systems at present and that it will also open the door for\nexciting new robotic applications in bio-technology and semiconductor industries.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/N508913/1","grantId":"EP/N508913/1","fundValue":"106153","fundStart":"2016-01-01","fundEnd":"2017-12-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Sundar  Marimuthu","coPersons":["Mike  Jackson"],"organisation":"Loughborough University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
