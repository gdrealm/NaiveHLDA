{"id":"6EA6FE0A-B88D-44AF-89ED-6D3A759A3B85","title":"Extracting Leading Indicators from Transport Data Monitoring Programs using Human Factors Methods","abstractText":"Flight Data Monitoring (FDM) is the process by which data from on-board recorders (or so-called 'black boxes') is subject to regular and systematic analysis, not just after emergencies but after every flight. This is performed so that subtle trends which arise as pre-cursors to more serious incidents can be detected in advance and used to proactively manage risk. The same technique is also used as a way of meeting environmental and economic goals through improved operational efficiency, fuel consumption and maintenance. \n\nFDM is relevant to the railway industry because since 2005 all trains now have to carry similar on-board recorders. The primary motivation is to provide accident investigators with an invaluable diagnostic tool, but like the aviation sector, because accidents are comparatively rare a far greater quantity of data is collected on normal, routine, non-accident journeys. As a result, recorder data in the rail industry represents a significantly underused resource. \n\nThe proposed research relates to a class of problem which occurs firmly at the human/system interface and which is shared by both the aviation and rail sectors. Both domains experience problems, for example, Signals Passed At Danger (or SPADs) and Controlled Flight Into Terrain (CFIT), where several safety systems are defeated by human operators and otherwise fully functional trains or aircraft are placed in highly unsafe conditions. Problems such as these fall within the purview of Human Factors. On-board recorder data, be it from the rail or aviation sectors, represents a novel source of input for established human factors methodologies targeted at addressing them. \n\nThe primary goal of the research, therefore, will be to couple recorder data to human factors methods in a way not previously attempted. The outcome will be 'leading indicators' of problems which, so far, have proven resistant to conventional safety interventions. Related to this are leading indicators, or metrics, that could help to inform ongoing research into operational efficiency, 'eco-driving', and potentially cost-saving insights into future maintenance practices. These opportunities can be systematically examined with reference both to human factors methods and to the mature FDM processes that currently exist in the aviation industry. \n\nThe project is set against, and motivated by, a wider backdrop of European rail interoperability, a desire to maximise the environmental benefits of rail travel and the UK's position as a world leader in FDM processes. Whilst the research has at its core an innovative programme of theoretical advance, it is also coupled to several near-term applications. Firstly, the UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) seek to inform (and be informed of) best practice in other transport domains and the proposed project aims to provide a conduit for such knowledge. Secondly, both the CAA and the Association of Train Operating Companies (ATOC) are actively seeking leading indicators of safety related problems, particularly those which occur at the human/system interface. The project will map important theoretical developments in human factors methods to these real-world applications. Third, the proposed research is directly relevant to current industry projects managed by the Rail Safety and Standards Board (RSSB), including several relating to safety management systems, eco-driving and route knowledge. \n\nIn summary, the proposed research represents a highly innovative approach to understanding and diagnosing issues which occur at the boundary of humans and transport systems. It is also an example of research with high economic and societal impacts, and an example of research application with great potential to develop further work and collaborations with industry partners.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I036222/1","grantId":"EP/I036222/1","fundValue":"95954","fundStart":"2012-03-01","fundEnd":"2013-02-28","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The findings have been presented widely to stakeholders and interested parties/bodies in the rail and aviation sector. At the time of writing the proof of concept funded by the EPSRC is likely to be extended into a larger industry funded project. This demonstrates the impacts in terms of improved safety performance, resilience and environmental footprint to be accrued through the novel use of black box data to drive behaviour change in pilots and train drivers. The project also coincided with some recent rail and aviation incidents which significantly raised the profile of the research.

A peculiar side effect of improving safety trends in both transport sectors is that the ability to collect data is now out of proportion to the number of accidents where it would ever be used. Fortunately, the UK aviation industry leads the world in using black box data before accidents or serious safety concerns even occur. The prediction of emergent safety issues from data on normal operations is called Flight Data Monitoring. This project is about transferring this knowledge into the rail sector. It is also about making data monitoring approaches better at detecting a particularly troublesome class of accident that features in both industries’ strategic safety plans. There are five key findings:\n\nThe project highlights that the data collected from black box recorders in the rail industry is a significantly underused resource. \n\nThe project demonstrates that the Flight Data Monitoring approach is compatible with data collected from train operations. It shows significant potential to improve and assure safety in the face of increasing operational intensity and risk exposure. \n\nThe project shows that the class of accident, or near accident, which is prominent within rail and aviation strategic safety plans is comprised of distinct yet shared psychological features. \n\nThe project has innovated six Human Factors Leading Indicators. These provide highly novel predictive insights into driver/pilot behaviour based on transport data recordings. In doing so they respond to industry strategic safety concerns and have been made compatible with existing Flight Data Monitoring approaches. \n\nThe project opens up a highly impactful future research agenda. The work leads directly to the continued development of a Rail Data Monitoring programme. Such a programme could be used across the industry and/or by individual train operating companies. The benefits of ‘Flight’ Data Monitoring are well established and the same benefits can be accrued in the rail sector. \n\nThe Human Factors Leading Indicators are designed to be easily incorporated into existing Flight Data Monitoring software tools, facilitating their testing, validation and subsequent use on large scale transport datasets. \n\nBlack box data recorders are becoming widespread in other transport domains and the same benefits/Human Factors insights apply. The work is being expanded into the Logistics/Road Freight sector under an EPSRC Grant entitled ‘The Centre for Sustainable Road Freight’. The research has been presented to the Rail Safety and Standards Board (RSSB) in the context of scoping a future research project. \n\nThe research will be presented to the Association of Train Operating Companies’ (ATOC) Operations Standards Forum in order to identify specific exploitation routes within the rail sector. \n\nThe research has been presented to Flight Data Monitoring stakeholders at the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) to identify specific exploitation routes within the aviation sector. \n\nThe results have been shared with Greater Anglia Trains who provided the current dataset and are seeking ways to make better use of it. \n\nThe underpinning science has been exploited through academic channels such as international conferences and articles in the peer reviewed press.
