It applies a range of discourse analytic techniques to the genres involved, contrasting for example official reports, school newsletters, campaign literature, and media coverage. The aim is twofold.&nbsp; Firstly, the project seeks to inform the formation of policy and opinion on school meals by uncovering different agendas and understandings in the debate.
