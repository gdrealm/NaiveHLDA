{"id":"15B5C6BE-7DD0-4C2C-9CC7-209EB1AD5A65","title":"The transparent observatory: opening the James Gregory Telescope to the public","abstractText":"The goal of this proposal is to transform the James Gregory Telescope (JGT) at the University of St. Andrews into a 'transparent observatory', i.e. an observatory where the public can experience world-class research as it happens. In the long-term this initiative aims to establish the JGT as a scientific and cultural icon in Scotland and as a focal point for the science outreach in St. Andrews. In the following we will show how we will achieve this goal. Under 'objectives' we list our key goals.\n\nWe will set up weekly open nights at the JGT, i.e. evenings where the public can visit the telescope and experience it in action. If the weather allows it, these evenings will be used for scientific observations, for example for hunting extrasolar planets. The visitors will be introduced to the history and the research of the observatory by the on-site astronomer. The on-site astronomers can be staff members, postdoctoral researchers, or advanced postgraduate students. They will be trained by the Observatory Director for these events. Once set up and properly promoted, the events are sustainable as a long-term initiative. Through these open nights, the research carried out in the School of Physics and Astronomy and other astronomy groups in Scotland will be communciated to a large and diverse audience.\n\nTo kickstart this initiative, we ask for funding from STFC. In particular, we need resources to advertise the initiative. Using facilities at the University of St. Andrews, we will design and print leaflets and posters for the observatory. Leaflets will be distributed through the tourist office in St. Andrews to visitors and through the University to students. We already maintain contacts to many primary and secondary schools through previous initiatives; our aim is now to provide about 1000 schools in Scotland with a poster of the observatory and to invite school classes to visit the site of the observatory. \n\nFurthermore, we plan to present the observatory to the amateur astronomers in Scotland, a group that can effectively spread the word about our initiative and thus multiply our efforts. For this to happen, we will visit the main amateur organisations in Scotland, give talks, inform about the observatory, and encourage them to stay in contact. \n\nOn the ground floor of the observatory we will set up a permanent exhibition illustrating the equipment, historic context, the observations, and the ongoing research. This exhibition is already partially in place, additional funding is necessary for poster walls and printing. We will add a desktop computer with display that continuously shows the incoming images from the telescope and results from the analysis, to 'broadcast' the scientific work to the visitors.\n\nWe will establish a new website for the observatory, where all information about the telescope and the open nights are presented. Instead of the current static website, the key goal is to include a weblog which can regularly be updated with information on current research projects and events. The framework for such a dynamic website will be created in a summer project by students at the University of St. Andrews, for which funding needs to be reserved.\n\nFinally, the new initiative will be advertised once a year with a press release through the press office at the University of St. Andrews, to reach the important audience of journalists and bloggers.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/L001411/1","grantId":"ST/L001411/1","fundValue":"6350","fundStart":"2014-01-01","fundEnd":"2015-12-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Alexander  Scholz","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of St Andrews","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
