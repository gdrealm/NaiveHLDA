{"id":"87CB8ADC-9D66-435C-9711-4EEC7783F474","title":"Automatic and individually optimised fitting of cochlear implants","abstractText":"A cochlear implant is a device to help deaf people hear. It translates sounds into electrical impulses applied to the hearing nerve in the ear. It is an important device that allows spoken communication and, for infants, the opportunity to develop spoken language. This project has two broad aims. The first is to develop ways to fit a cochlear implant without having to do lengthy tests involving the patients listening and making judgments about sounds. We will do this by directly measuring the activity of the hearing nerve and the brain in response to sounds. The second broad aim is to understand why different people are more or less successful with the implant, and, armed with this information, how to individually optimise the fitting so that the potential of each person is fully realised. Once again we will measure the responses of the hearing nerve and the brain to sounds, and use these to understand the differences in the way that each person hears with a cochlear implant. We can then find the significance of these differences for speech understanding and work out ways to optimise the settings of the sound processor based on individual characteristics. In summary, it is hoped that the research project will improve speech understanding with a cochlear implant, especially for those who currently do not do as well as their peers. Importantly, it is hoped that good quality fittings can be achieved for infants thus maximising their potential for spoken language development.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0701461","grantId":"G0701461","fundValue":"554161","fundStart":"2008-07-06","fundEnd":"2011-07-05","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Colette  McKay","coPersons":["Wael  El-Deredy","R  Carlyon"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
