{"id":"375FACF4-2BDA-4EFF-8CFF-9F6B2EF8C267","title":"Analysis of SNARE protein spatio-temporal dynamics during exocytosis in living cells","abstractText":"All cells in higher organisms have a requirement to move membranes and proteins around, whilst identifying and maintaining the compartments the various factors are in. A final step in this process may be secretion, or exocytosis, where specialised cells can export hormones (like insulin) or neurotransmitters (like serotonin) to the outside of the cells, thus enabling inter-cell communication. It has been known for some time that all these processes are mediated by specialised proteins in the cell; this was defined in the test-tube, and the protein players identified. Until recently, however, it has not been possible to identify where and when these proteins interact\nwith one another inside cells. Microscopy has been limited to the simple observational process of seeing where things are. My laboratory, and many others, have helped develop functional imaging , where microscopes can be used not only for seeing things, but looking at their functions. In particular, I have techniques for visualising proteins as they interact with partners inside living cells. These approaches will be used to bridge the gap between our biochemical knowledge from the test-tube, and what actually happens in the cell during secretion.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0901607","grantId":"G0901607","fundValue":"453005","fundStart":"2011-01-05","fundEnd":"2014-02-28","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Rory  Duncan","coPersons":["Colin David Rickman","Luke Haydn Chamberlain"],"organisation":"Heriot-Watt University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
