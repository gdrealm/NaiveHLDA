{"id":"382BDFB7-6E32-415A-9CE9-7491EB0481B8","title":"Ultimate Microsocopy: Wavelength-Limited Resolution Without High Quality Lenses","abstractText":"At the beginning of the 20th century, scientists discovered how to measure the size and spacing of atoms using a technique called diffraction, which led to a revolution in the understanding of chemistry, biology and solid-state physics. X-rays and electrons behave like waves, but with a wavelength which is much smaller than the spacing between the atoms of a solid. These waves scatter and interfere with one another, producing strong beams coming out of the object at particular angles. By measuring these angles, and knowing the wavelength of the waves, the separation of atoms could be calculated. It was using this method that Watson and Crick determined the structure of DNA in the 1950s. However, diffraction is only useful if the object is a regular lattice structure. In order to look at more complicated atomic structures, scientists have relied on electron or X-ray microscopes. In a standard microscope, a lens is used to produce a magnified image, but the method still relies on the waves that make up the radiation (light, electrons or X-rays) interfering with one another to build up the image. With light, this is experimentally easy, but with very-short wavelength radiation (a fraction of an atomic diameter), the tiniest error in the lens or the experimental apparatus makes the waves interfere incorrectly, ruining the image. For this reason, a typical electron or X-ray microscope image is about one hundred times more blurred than the theoretical limit defined by the wavelength.In this project, we aim to unify the strengths of the above apparently very different techniques to get the best-ever pictures of individual atoms in any structure (which is not necessarily crystalline). Our approach is to use a conventional (relatively bad) X-ray or electron lens to form a patch of moderately-focussed illumination (like burning a hole in a piece of paper with the sun's rays through a magnifying glass). In fact, we do not need a lens at all! Just a moveable aperture put in front of the object of interest will suffice. We then record the intensity of the diffraction pattern which emerges from the other side of the object on a good-quality high-resolution detector, for several positions of the illuminating beam. This data does not look anything like the object, but we have worked out a way of calculating a very good image of the object by a process called 'phase-retrieval'. To make an image of an object we have to know what's called the relative phase (the different arrival times) of the waves that get scattered from it. In diffraction, this information is lost, although some of it is preserved (badly) by a lens. Our data is a complex mixture of diffraction and image data, but the key innovation in this project is that we can use a computer to calculate the phase of the very high resolution data which could never be seen by the lens alone. Other workers in the United States have demonstrated very limited versions of this new approach, but we have a much more sophisticated computational method which eliminates essentially all earlier restrictions.The new method, which has received patent protection, could be implemented on existing electron or X-ray microscopes, greatly enhancing their imaging capability. It is even possible to contemplate a solid-state optical microscope, built into a single chip with no optical elements at all. All the weakness and difficulties and costs of lenses would be replaced by a combination of good quality detectors and computers. Our ultimate aim is to be able to image in 3D directly (using X-rays or electrons) any molecular structure, although this will require a great deal of research. The work put forward in this proposal will build the Basic Technology foundations of this new approach to the ultimate microscope.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E034055/1","grantId":"EP/E034055/1","fundValue":"4327940","fundStart":"2007-09-03","fundEnd":"2012-03-02","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  A principal route to market has been via a University of Sheffield spin-out company (Phase Focus Ltd). 5 patent families arising directly from this work have been sold to Phase Focus (two of these are not yet published).

We have developed a way of making transmission microscopes without using lenses. Instead, we pass radiation (light, X-rays or high speed electrons) through an object and just record how the radiation has been affected by the object using a detector positioned a long way beyond it. What arrives on the detector (called a 'diffraction pattern') doesn't resemble the object at all. However, we have developed a way of processing this intensity pattern in a computer to make an artificial image. This roundabout method turns out to have many advantages over a conventional lens-based microscope. First, the picture we obtain has much more information in it about the object than a normal image: for example, we can see transparent objects, like biological cells, much more clearly and quantitatively. Second, it is very hard to make good lenses for X-rays or electrons. However, these 'high-energy' radiations are the only ones that can see really small objects like individual atoms. In fact, X-ray and electron lenses are so bad that their resolution (the smallest thing they can see) is about 20-100 bigger than the theoretical limit. In other words, our method opens up the opportunity to see the smallest atomic-sized details ever when looking through an object.\n\nUntil recently, using just a detector and computer to calculate an image like this was regarded as extremely difficult and could only be done for small objects. The technique we have developed during this project uses two or more (we often use up to a thousand) diffraction patterns which can make images of arbitrarily big objects. The fundamental algorithm which had acted as our original proof-of-principle had quite a few limitations. When we began to use it on real data, all sorts of experimental errors damaged the resulting image. The project consisted of four main parts: developing the method at (1) light, (2) X-ray and (3) electron wavelengths, and (4) developing the computational methods to overcome experimental problems that we encountered at these various wavelengths. \n\nA big hurdle that we overcame was extending the algorithm so that we didn't need to know the shape of the radiation patch illuminating the object: previously a great weakness of the method. We also developed a way of working out exactly where the object had been illuminated: a key parameter which we discovered was almost impossible to control accurately in the electron microscope, and to a lesser extent at X-ray wavelengths. We also developed methods of greatly improving the potential resolution of the technique and a way of handling thick objects which scatter strongly (the original algorithm could only work on thin objects).\n\nWe also demonstrated that we could overcome the lens-based resolution limit in electron microscopy by a factor five: a revolutionary result. We also applied the new computational methods to various objects in light and X-ray imaging, for example using it to differentiate between cancerous and healthy cells. Many of the activities listed under 'Narrative Impact' are relevant to commercial research laboratories which require very high performance microscopy facilities. Particular areas of activity will include drug discovery (eg using our technology for high-throughput screening); development of high-performance catalysts for use in the oil or automobile industry; the semiconductor industry, say in the context of surface metrology (using light) or 3D structural discovering (using transmission electron microscopy).\n\nA spin-off company formed by the University of Sheffield (Phase Focus Ltd) has acquired and is prosecuting five out of the six patents generated by the project. (The fifth patent is not relevant to Phase Focus - a licensee is being sought). It has so far raised ?5.7M private equity funding and is currently engaged in a further funding round. It has 15 employees and is planned to expand quickly.\nThe company has developed a product which is now being sold into a niche but profitable market - the contact lens industry. It turns out that the very accurate phase image produced by the technique is uniquely capable of measuring with extreme accuracy soft contact lens profiles in their native solution (which of course are transparent in normal transmission) over a very large field of view.\n\nThe company has also developed a 'demonstrator' general biological phase imaging microscope, one of which is installed and is working very successfully in a leading UK research laboratories. This will be marketed shortly.\n\nThe company is working in collaboration with a third party to develop an 'add-on' device which will improve the resolution of a standard transmission electron microscope (TEM) by a significant factor, and will facilitate sensitive phase imaging (say for whole cell tomography, magnetic field imaging or inner potential mapping in semiconductors).\n\nAlthough dedicated microscopy (light, X-ray and electron) devices will be sold mostly into the academic research environment, Phase Focus is exploring direct sales (or licensing agreements) in several industrial markets (most being confidential at the time of writing): the contact lens industry is the first such market being exploited.\n Transmission microscopy is a universal enabling technology that allows for the qualitative and quantitative imaging of the microscopic structure all types of objects - biological, mineral and man-made. Our research has greatly enhanced the power of microscopy at all scale sizes from 10s of microns down to the sub-nanometre. It has defined a new route to much higher resolution at atomic-scale wavelengths; it has provided a new image signal (absolute phase contrast) which has previously been only approximately accessible by other contrast techniques (holography, differential interference microscopy and Zernike contrast), which is uniquely capable of delivering quantitative images without distortion; our latest developments have shown it can deliver 3D imaging while at the same time removing multiple scattering effects, thus opening up a new route to imaging thick objects.\n\nImaging using the high-resolution and sensitive phase image in electron microscopy will have applications in: all areas of research currently undertaken using (the very difficult) technique of electron holography - for example, the measurement of microscopic magnetic fields in materials used for magnetic storage media, the measurement of the inner potential (eg the doping profile of semiconductors); studies into porous materials; catalysis particles; whole cell tomography; metallurgy; soft matter materials (eg characterisation of polymer films used for inexpensive solar cells); ceramics such as hard and tribological coating technology; structure of sol-gels; and all areas of semiconductor metrology.\n\nSimilar applications will be found at X-ray wavelengths, with the added advantage of imaging thick objects (relative to the electron microscope). The phase sensitivity of the technique is particularly useful in the field of imaging and tomography of thick biological objects such as bone.\n\nAs well as improving 2D imaging of all types of biological structure, the novel 3D technique alone at optical wavelengths should have applications in: 3D developmental biology, 3D drug delivery and diffusion, cancer research (specifically early 3D growth of tumorous cell clusters, their blood supply and the effect chemotherapy), 3D chemical signally in realistic live structures, tissue engineering (especially development of effective 3D artificial scaffold materials), 3D dynamics of nano-particle drug delivery mechanisms, 3D chromosome topology during division, live 3D brain cell topology and growth, the study of artificially induced nerve repair. \n\nIn view of the above, the final benefits will accrue to a very wide range of societal outputs: improved health via new drugs developed using cell assays; less expensive or more efficient manufactured objects (ranging from cars to aircraft to domestic appliances) via more controlled and/or better engineered and/or less expensive materials, including in the field of low-carbon energy sources.
