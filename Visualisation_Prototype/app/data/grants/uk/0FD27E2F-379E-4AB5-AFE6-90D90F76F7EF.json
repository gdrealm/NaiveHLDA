Yet there is no systematic investigation of the intersections of these fields and their significance for society.</p>\n\n<p>The project examines the development and application of innovative biomedical technologies relevant to musculoskeletal injury, enabling analysis of two types of questions. Against a mapping of emerging interactions between sports and biomedicine, the research asks, first: What are the effects of sports patronage and collaboration on biomedical innovation, and conversely, how does biomedical research and innovation impact on elite sports and its athletes? Second, the research sets out to clarify the ethical issues raised by these developments and how publics and stakeholders understand and evaluate them (including the 'human enhancement' debate).</p>\n\n<p>A multi-method research design sets the study in the context of sports in general, focusing on football (soccer) and cycling as case studies because of their different funding regimes and injury profiles. Data are collected via documents, interviews, and observation methods (eg at sports' medical conferences). We undertake ethical analysis and public engagement comprising deliberative interactive online debate and focus groups to clarify issues of concern, and to inform and elicit public opinion.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K010956/1","grantId":"ES/K010956/1","fundValue":"437471","fundStart":"2013-09-30","fundEnd":"2017-05-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Alex  Faulkner","coPersons":["Mike  McNamee","Jonathan  Gabe"],"organisation":"University of Sussex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
