The Viking Identities Network will stimulate both academic and popular discussions about the creation of 'Viking', 'Norse' and 'hybrid' identities in the Viking Age, and their 21''-century legacy. The project will explore (1) the role of women and gender in language and material culture and (2) the memorialising of Viking identities from pagan times to the present.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=119471/1","grantId":"119471/1","fundValue":"19905","fundStart":"2006-04-01","fundEnd":"2009-03-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  By academics in a variety of publications, and by heritage and cultural organisations in their work.

Prominent themes of the network events and subsequent publications were gender, identity and myth, and the network also launched the concept of the 'Viking diaspora', now well established both in the academic world and the public consciousness. The idea of the network was to develop new understandings and methods in Viking studies - these can then be taken forward by specialists in their own disciplines, in a variety of ways.
