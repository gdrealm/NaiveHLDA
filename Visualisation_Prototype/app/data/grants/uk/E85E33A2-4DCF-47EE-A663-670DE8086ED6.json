Although medical treatment is effective approximately 50% of patient will need an operation to remove an affected segment of bowel over the first 5 years after diagnosis. Recurrence following surgery occurs in the majority of patients. 6-Mercaptopurine is an effective treatment for the reduction of symptoms and maintenance of well being in Crohn s disease but its use to prevent post operative recurrence is poorly defined. Previous studies have been small, retrospective or flawed in design. In this multicentre study we wish to assess the value of the drug 6-mercaptopurine to prevent recurrence of Crohn s disease following surgery. We will use the recurrence of symptoms as the primary outcome measure, with endoscopic examination of the relevant area and the need for further sugery as secondary outcome measures. If this trial were to show an effect of the drug we would anticipate a wide uptake and improved quality of life for patients with Crohn s disease following surgery.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0600329","grantId":"G0600329","fundValue":"1506840","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2019-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Jack  Satsangi","coPersons":["Malcolm Graham Dunlop","Robin John Prescott","Craig  Mowat","Ian  Arnott","Mhairi  Collie","David C Bartolo","Ashley  Mowat","Aidan  Cahill"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
