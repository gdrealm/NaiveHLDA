Firstly, acting on advice from potential investors in the spin-off company arising from our patented work, to produce three betatest versions of each of two instruments (miniature UV detector, capillary spectrophotometer) for which alpha-test versions have been designed and built with support by the University of York through Proof of Principle funding. These will be placed with key R&amp;D contacts in academia and industry, for evaluation and feedback to inform subsequent commercialization. The second strand is to produce an alpha-test version of a third instrument, a multiplexed capillary spectrophotometer, with robotic sample handling designed and built under sub-contract by a speciality robotics company. Market research has shown that this instrument has huge potential in the pharmaceutical industry.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D503183/1","grantId":"EP/D503183/1","fundValue":"25690","fundStart":"2006-01-03","fundEnd":"2007-01-02","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"David Murray Goodall","coPersons":["Edmund  Bergstrom"],"organisation":"University of York","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
