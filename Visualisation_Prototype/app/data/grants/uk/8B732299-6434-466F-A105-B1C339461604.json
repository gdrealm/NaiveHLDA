{"id":"8B732299-6434-466F-A105-B1C339461604","title":"Directed Reconfigurable Nanomachines","abstractText":"Directed Reconfigurable NanomachinesWe propose a scheme to revolutionise the synthesis of nanodevices, nanomachines, and, ultimately, functional materials via the positional assembly of molecules and nanoscale building blocks. Computer-directed actuators will be used to drive (with sub-nanometre to sub-Angstrom precision) the elements of a nanosystem along pre-defined and entirely deterministic trajectories, thereby achieving structures not accessible by mimicking natural assembly strategies alone. Linkages and bonding between the building blocks will also be initiated, modulated, and - in some cases - terminated by direct computer control. Our proposal rests on the parallel development of novel surface-bound, reconfigurable nanoscale building blocks (molecules, functionalised clusters, nanoparticles) and advanced techniques for automated assembly of matter. We focus on the generation of two major and immensely challenging functionalities for positionally-assembled nanomachines: switchable energy transduction and conformationally-driven motion. Our archetypal system comprises the following units: an energy harvester, a switchable/gateable link, and an optical or mechanical output. By arranging, configuring, and triggering these fundamental units our long-term goal is no less than the fabrication of an autonomous, abiotic nanomachine.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F010109/1","grantId":"EP/F010109/1","fundValue":"80600","fundStart":"2008-05-01","fundEnd":"2011-04-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Ashley James Cadby","coPersons":["Guenter  Moebus"],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
