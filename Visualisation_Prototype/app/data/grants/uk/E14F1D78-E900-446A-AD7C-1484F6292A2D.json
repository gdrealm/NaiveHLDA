There are two contributions: One in the short term (3 years) and one in the long term (6 years), which we will develop in a later proposal. In the short term we propose to advance the field of computer vision by exploiting a novel imaging technology, called plenoptic imaging. In the long term we propose to apply plenoptic visual inspection to the medical field.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F023073/1","grantId":"EP/F023073/1","fundValue":"313254","fundStart":"2008-04-01","fundEnd":"2011-08-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Paolo  Favaro","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Heriot-Watt University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
