Much\nof the energy emitted by developing stars and young stars is absorbed by the clouds of gas and dust in which they form,\nand re-radiated in the far infrared. So if we want to understand the birth processes of stars in our own galaxy today, or to\ninvestigate how galaxies grow and develop (through star-formation), we need to make observations in the far infrared. In\nrecent years, huge advances have been made by telescopes in space and operating on high altitude balloons in our\nendeavours to gain knowledge of the details of star and planetary system formation and the history of galaxies like our own\nMilky Way. But astronomy at far infrared wavelengths has a long way to go before we will be able to take pictures with\nsimilar quality to that obtained by optical telescopes at shorter wavelengths and by arrays of radio telescopes at longer\nwavelengths.\nObservations have to be made from space or from high altitude because the atmosphere is strongly absorbing in this part\nof the spectrum. That makes it difficult to use large ground-based telescopes. In addition, the technique of &quot;interferometry&quot;,\nused in the radio region of combining the beams from number of smaller telescopes to make an image as good as that\nfrom a much larger one, has not yet been perfected in the far infrared. So at present, the image quality of observations in\nthe far infrared is not nearly as good as astronomers need to get a better view of stars and galaxies and their origins.\nIn this project we will make a big advance by building the first scientific interferometer working in the far infrared, flying it on\na high altitude balloon, and making observations of both of star forming regions in our galaxy and also of active galaxies\nharbouring massive black holes at their centres, to learn more about how stars form in clusters and how black holes\ninteract with the galaxies they inhabit. These pioneering measurements will be the highest quality far infrared observations\never, in terms of our ability to discern fine details in the image. Besides giving us new scientific insights, they will allow us\nto perfect and demonstrate the technology needed to build a more ambitions and powerful instrument in the future, perhaps\na space-borne system, to provide even better observations. The scientific importance of such an observatory has been\nrecognised by both NASA and by the European Space Agency, who are considering space missions of this type. However,\nthe necessary technology and expertise is not available yet, and this work will make a big contribution to establishing our\ncapability to fly such a mission.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/K002775/1","grantId":"ST/K002775/1","fundValue":"115635","fundStart":"2013-01-15","fundEnd":"2015-01-14","funder":"STFC","impactText":"  The progress made on both the instrument simulator for BETTII and the material studies for the calibration source of the test campaign have allowed us to modify the design of the final source which will be used to better characterize the instrument which will fly next year. \nThe improvements in our understanding of the instrument will allow the first spectral-spatial inteferometer flown on a balloon to provide pioneering data both from a technological point of view (use a technique which will improve future instruments) and to better understand the way stars form by looking in greater detail at regions where the latter form.\nIn society we are looking at the possibility to apply this technique to Earth Observations which has the potential of increasing thermal imaging resolution on the ground from space substantially.

This technique is being studied in a range of wavelengths where the atmosphere is opaque and so the instrument being developed in the US (NASA Goddard) with whom we collaborate is scheduled to fly on a High-altitude balloon.\nWith this activity we aim to provide the means to calibrate the performance of the on board instruments as well as to use the software tools developed at UCL to predict its performance as well as foresee any issue that might arise during flight. Once our calibration source will be built, it will provide a reliable way to test this and possible future instruments in this wavelength range. \nAt the same time, future instruments planning to use this technique of measurement (Double Fourier Modulation or spectral-spatial interferometry) will be able to make use of the software developed which will be made available to the public.
