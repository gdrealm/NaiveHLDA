It will ask them about facilities available to them at their place of work, and whether they work away from their employerâ€™s business, as well as asking what resources are available to their students.\n<br />\n<br />Two focus groups will be undertaken to explore more complex and discursive issues, particularly those which relate to data access issues with which many researchers will not be familiar.\n<br />\n<br />Respondents will not be limited to users of microdata. However, the primary goal of the research is to inform data access discussions relating to the census microdata, and more widely as we look towards the delivery of other data sources for producing census-like outputs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<br />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F035284/1","grantId":"ES/F035284/1","fundValue":"78007","fundStart":"2008-07-01","fundEnd":"2010-02-07","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Josephine Clare Wathan","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
