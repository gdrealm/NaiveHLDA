These factors are encoded by genes, which are frequently found on mobile pieces of DNA known as genomic islands (GI). Transmission of GIs between bacteria is predicted to disseminate pathogenicity determinants amongst bacteria causing the spread of virulence. In plant pathogenic bacteria the acquisition or loss of pathogenicity determinants can result in a change of virulence. We have previously found that the pathogenicity determinant avrPphB resides on a GI designated PPHGI-1, which if deleted from the chromosome of the plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pathovar phaseolicola strain 1302A, causes a change in pathogenicity on differential cultivars of bean. Located on the GI are genes predicted to mediate the mobilisation of the GI as well as genes thought to be involved in conjugation of mobile elements from one bacterium to another. This proposal will investigate, using molecular techniques, the function of the genes predicted to mediate movement and conjugation of the PPHGI-1 carrying avrPphB. We hypothesise that these mobility determinants will be involved in movement and transmission of avrPphB. The research will help to elucidate ubiquitous mechanisms involved in the transfer of pathogenicity in plant and animal pathogens, a knowledge of which could impact on medicinal and agricultural treatments against pathogens.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E001998/1","grantId":"BB/E001998/1","fundValue":"276775","fundStart":"2007-01-22","fundEnd":"2010-01-21","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Dawn  Arnold","coPersons":["John Walter Mansfield"],"organisation":"University of the West of England","findingsText":" Already submitted as part of this grants final report in March 2010.\n\nWe have shown major advances in the understanding of genomic islands (GIs) in bacterial evolution by:\n\n1) Showing transfer of a GI (PPHGI-1) from Pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola (Pph) 1302A to Pph 1448A. Identifying in planta bacterial GI transformation is a novel finding with high international interest. \n2) Creating Pph fluorescent strains to use with confocal microscopy in plant tissue undergoing hypersensitive response has enabled monitoring of colony development and bacterial survival within Phaseolus vulgaris (bean). \n3) Developing fluorescence reporter systems by dual labelling Pph in the chromosome and PPHGI-1. This system has allowed us to visualise dynamic PPHGI-1 excision and reinsertion as it occurs within the plant apoplast and extracted P. vulgaris apoplastic fluids.

Current Biology 2009 Sep 29;19(18):1586-90 we released a press release http://info.uwe.ac.uk/news/UWENews/article.asp?item=1563&amp;amp;year=2009 This was picked up and reported on by the Financial Times, Bristol Evening Post and the German 'Innovations Report' website.\n\nThe PI was awarded a BBSRC Public Engagement Award 2009 for a project entitled Evolving Communities. This project involved a multi-stage engagement between UWE biological scientists and local inner city school students, culminating in a public display and supporting interactive activities in a public shopping mall within Bristol. This display represented the students' &amp;quot;visions of human evolution&amp;quot; with regards to biological research and evolution. Two press releases came out of this project http://info.uwe.ac.uk/news/UWENews/article.asp?item=1648&amp;amp;year=2009 and http://info.uwe.ac.uk/news/UWENews/article.asp?item=1679&amp;amp;year=2010\n\nThe PI is also involved with an annual visit to the University by pupils from local schools to take part in Hands on Science day. Here the students carry out a number of interactive science experiments including DNA extraction. Agriculture, Food and Drink","dataset":"gtr"}
