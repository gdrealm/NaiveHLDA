{"id":"8C1B97BE-384F-4D5A-93BD-85974C01ADF1","title":"Environmentally friendly and energy efficient pultrusion","abstractText":"The aim of this project is to develop a new pultrusion technique that is environmentally friendly and one that permits new and fast-curable resin systems to be evaluated. In the conventional process, the reinforcing fibres are impregnated in a resin bath and then passed through a heated die to cross-link the resin and to shape the pultruded component. In the new manufacturing technique, the components of the resin will be stored in separate containers and pumped on-demand using a custom-designed liquid delivery system. Efficient and effective impregnation of the fibres will be achieved using a novel combination of an injection-head and electro hydrodynamic atomisation, and fibre spreading using mechanical and electrostatic-based techniques. The background to this current proposal is the successful completion of an EPSRC/DTI project on Clean Filament Winding where the technology for injecting the reinforcing fibres without the use of a resin bath was demonstrated. However, in the current project, new technology will be developed for the pultrusion process where up to 20 individual fibre bundles will be impregnated without using a conventional resin bath. The cure kinetics of the fast-curing resins will be evaluated and appropriate models will be used to predict the impregnation rates for the spread fibre bundles. Previously developed fibre optic sensors will be used to enable real-time chemical process monitoring and structural integrity assessment in-service. The green credentials of this new manufacturing technique will be assessed using life cycle assessment and life cycle cost analysis.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=TS/G000387/1","grantId":"TS/G000387/1","fundValue":"411841","fundStart":"2008-08-18","fundEnd":"2012-07-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Part 1 give the background and key achievements.\n\nThree major classes items of equipment were built, commissioned and evaluated namely, a pultrusion machine, a resin dispenser and resin impregnation units.

Two fibre spreading units were designed, manufactured and evaluated. A new concept based on &quot;tension-release&quot; for spreading the filaments in a bundle was proposed and published. \n\no The new environmentally friendly clean pultrusion technique was demonstrated successfully in the laboratory using four classes of thermosetting resins (epoxy, vinyl ester, polyester and polyurethane).\n\no Although site trials were not part of the original Second Level Plan (SLP), a number of site trials were undertaken and the new pultrusion technique was demonstrated successfully on site.\n\no Binder specific E-glass fibres were supplied by PPG for the matrices that were used in this project.\n\no A range of polyurethane resin formulations were provided by HUN and evaluated by UB.\n\no A unique multi-functional fibre optic sensor system was optimised over the course of this project. This sensor system was capable of providing information on strain, temperature, refractive index and cross-linking kinetics.\n\no The fibre-optic Fresnel sensor system was adopted for integration into the pultruded composites.\n\no An anomaly was observed when acrylate-coated optical fibre sensors are embedded in composites and subjected to a temperature regime above the glass transition of the acrylate. This anomaly is not observed when polyimide coated fibre sensors are used.\n\no A life cycle analysis was carried out on the conventional and clean pultrusion techniques where the &quot;green&quot; credentials of the new pultrusion technique was demonstrated.\n\no An exploitation strategy was developed for new build and retrofitting the clean pultrusion technique.
