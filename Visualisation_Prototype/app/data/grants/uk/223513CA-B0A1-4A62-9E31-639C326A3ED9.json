Our population will continue to age with an increasing absolute and relative number of people aged 50 and over. At the same time there will also be a marked increase the proportion of people in black and minority populations in the later life age groups as we see the ageing of the migrant populations who moved to the UK in the post war period.</p>\n\n<p>However we know very little about the circumstances and experiences of black and minority elders in terms how they experience 'growing older'; what the key challenges (and opportunities) this confronts them with, what are the most important research questions to ask, what are the best ways to undertake research with these diverse groups; how should we train health and social care staff to work with diverse populations and how relevant is contemporary social and health policy for these diverse groups.&nbsp; Our series of six seminars will identify and debate the key issues surrounding the experience of ageing amongst a diverse range of ethnic minority communities.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J021547/1","grantId":"ES/J021547/1","fundValue":"18095","fundStart":"2012-11-07","fundEnd":"2014-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Christina  Victor","coPersons":["Vanessa  Burholt","Akile  Ahmet","Wendy  Martin","Deborah  Cairns","Karan  Jutlla"],"organisation":"Brunel University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
