{"id":"CD8AFE4B-BD10-46F5-8BAB-457415F4455A","title":"Probing the translational dynamics of influenza virus infection.","abstractText":"At the cellular level, the outcome of virus infection hinges on a battle between virus and cell for the control of the cellular biosynthetic machinery, as this ultimately determines the amount of progeny virus produced. Many viruses encode their own nucleic acid polymerases, but all are reliant on the cellular protein synthesis machinery. The ribosome therefore represents the key battleground. Using the major human and animal pathogen influenza A virus (IAV) as a model system, we will use the novel technique of ribosomal profiling to detail this conflict at a level of detail hitherto impossible. Ribosomal profiling allows the accurate determination of which mRNAs (viral or cellular) that the ribosomes are translating at a given moment; thereby defining the state of the 'frontline' in the battle for control of the cell. Our objectives are to:\n\n1. Define the cellular and viral mRNAs that are translated in virus-host cell combinations where either the virus 'wins' or where the host wins.\n\n2. To define which of the many viral mechanisms that affect cellular gene expression are and their specific targets which decide the outcome of the battle for control of the cellular translation machinery.\n\n3. Test the hypothesis that IAV specifically manipulates the ribosome to bias it towards preferential translation of viral messengers.\n\n\nOverall, the project will define the key events from both virus and cellular perspective that define whether an individual infected cell is productively infected; data that will aid the design of new therapeutic intervention strategies.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/M011747/1","grantId":"MR/M011747/1","fundValue":"695671","fundStart":"2015-03-01","fundEnd":"2018-02-28","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Ian  Brierley","coPersons":["Helen Margaret Wise","Paul  Digard"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
