The development of new crop varieties by plant breeding is based on harnessing the natural variation that is generated through the process of sexual reproduction and selective crossing to produce lines with novel combinations of desirable characteristics. During the formation of male and female gametes new combinations of the parental genes inherited by an individual are generated through the process of meiosis. In meiosis, homologous recombination ensures that chromosomes are accurately segregated such that each gamete gets a single complete set of chromosomes. To achieve this, transient physical links must be established between homologous pairs of parental chromosomes. This results in the reciprocal exchange of genetic information between each pair of homologous parental chromosomes, thereby generating a new combination of genes along each chromosome. Thus when male and female gametes fuse during sexual reproduction the progeny possess some characteristics of each parent and novel features that have arisen through the 'shuffling' of genes during meiotic recombination. Control of the patterns of recombination along chromosomes during meiosis in plants is therefore one of the major factors determining the outcome of plant breeding programmes. Unfortunately, it is clear that patterns of recombination can be highly skewed such that genes in some regions of the genome rarely undergo recombination. This is the case in some important grass species such as barley and wheat where it can have an adverse effect on potential breeding programmes Over the past decade studies in Arabidopsis, the model system for plant genetics, have resulted in considerable progress in our understanding of how meiosis and recombination in plants is controlled at the molecular level. Hence, this project seeks to transfer some of this knowledge to the crop plant barley and thus enable plant breeders to overcome one of the major challenges they face in the development of new varieties of this crop. This is feasible in the case of barley because we have a good understanding of barley genetics and genetic tools are in place for this crop to facilitate such a transfer. Our objectives will be to determine how meiotic recombination is controlled in barley and the basis for the skewed pattern of recombination. We will then explore strategies that could be used to manipulate the patterns of recombination that could be applied by plant breeders in their existing programmes without recourse to GM technology. If this is successful these approaches could then be applied to more complex grass crop species such as wheat and forage grasses (e.g. ryegrass) that show the same skewed distribution of recombination.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F019351/1","grantId":"BB/F019351/1","fundValue":"1025410","fundStart":"2008-08-01","fundEnd":"2013-07-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Chris  Franklin","coPersons":["Susan  Armstrong"],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
