They are important for everyday functioning and for maintaining our sense of individual identity. Our memory abilities change over our lifetimes, and specific kinds of memory problems come about as a result of brain damage. To understand how our memories change, and to be in a position to minimise negative impacts associated with memory loss, it is important to understand the kinds of mental operations that support our memories, as well as which brain regions underpin these mental operations. One approach which has been employed successfully to resolve some of these issues involves recording the electrical activity of the brain via sensors located outside the head. The signals that are acquired are called event-related potentials (ERPs) and they provide a real-time measure of brain activity. Electrical signals comprise the principal way in which information is passed and processed in the brain, and the use of ERPs has contributed to our understanding of the kinds of mental operations that support our memories, as well as the times at which these different mental operations occur. In this application we will use this technique for measuring brain electrical activity to investigate whether there are important differences between the ways in which our brains support our memories, and how they do so for different kinds of materials. It may be that not all kinds of memories are recovered in the same way. We also intend to address this question using a second real-time measure of brain activity. This technique exploits the fact that brain electrical activity has associated magnetic activity. By measuring this magnetic activity (often called event-related fields) we also obtain a real-time measure of brain activity, and critically the electrical and magnetic signals that can be recorded by sensors outside the head do not always provide the same information about the underlying brain activity. Because of this, it should be possible to gain a more complete picture of how our memories work by asking people to complete certain memory tasks and acquiring electrical as well as magnetic neural signals at the same time. This is something that has been done only rarely in studies of human memory to date, but our preliminary findings (where we have collected measures of brain activity using only one of either the electrical or the magnetic measure) suggest that conjoint acquisition is going to provide new information about how our memories work and how our brains support our memories. This is a timely and novel application because, in addition to contributing to an understanding of how our memories work, the findings will also start to map out the circumstances under which, to investigate particular properties of human memory, the most appropriate approach would be to employ only one or other of the electrical and magnetic measures. Different ways of measuring brain activity offer different insights into the relationship between brain activity and mental activity, and it is important to employ the technique that is best suited to the kinds of questions you wish to ask.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I001247/1","grantId":"BB/I001247/1","fundValue":"201430","fundStart":"2011-04-04","fundEnd":"2013-04-03","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Edward  Wilding","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
