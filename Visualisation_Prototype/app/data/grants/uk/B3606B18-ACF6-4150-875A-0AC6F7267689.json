The main research questions are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>How are mobility and quality of life understood within eastern and western migrantsâ€™ everyday lives and with what consequences for the ways in which they make sense of themselves and their relationships with others?</li>\n\n <li>How, in the light of the above, can a more integrated and informed understanding of lifestyle migration and flexible citizenship be developed and how might this set an agenda for further research?</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>These will be addressed through an empirical study of British migrants to Malaysia, Thailand and Hong Kong, and Hong Kong migrants to mainland China. The project will be informed by strong structuration theory and will employ virtual and visual ethnographic methods and life history interviews with migrant men and women.</p>\n\n<p>The research aims to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>increase the effectiveness of services and public policy (in UK, China, Hong Kong, Thailand and Malaysia)</li>\n\n <li>enhance UK economic competitiveness by encouraging effective help for, and mobilising resources of, British abroad</li>\n\n <li>enhance quality of life through improved health and social welfare</li>\n\n <li>to enhance mutual understanding in lifestyle destinations.</li>\n\n</ul>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-4357","grantId":"RES-000-22-4357","fundValue":"74272","fundStart":"2012-02-16","fundEnd":"2014-03-21","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Karen  O'Reilly","coPersons":["Robert  Stones"],"organisation":"Loughborough University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
