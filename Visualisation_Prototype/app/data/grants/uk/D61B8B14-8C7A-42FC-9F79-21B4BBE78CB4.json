However, a powerful approach lies in studying the embryonic brain, deciphering the genetic instructions that propel the emergence of structural and functional complexity. The genes involved are remarkably similar in all vertebrates, and many are shared even with the fruit fly, Drosophila. Indeed, it is the powerful genetics of fruit fly development that first identified most of the key genes and developmental mechanisms involved in building the vertebrate brain. We are working on some of the earliest steps in development, during which the embryo sets aside a group of cells and instructs them to make the brain; different regions of this primordial brain -- at this stage a simple-looking tube of cells -- are given different growth capacities and molecular character. Our main concern is how this process of regionalization endows specific subregions of what will become the forebrain with the potential to develop distinct cellular architecture and function. Throughout the process, different genes are activated in different places so as to precisely control the availability of their specific protein product, which may regulate the activity of other genes in the same cell or may be a signal to neighbouring cells. In development generally, an important regionalizing mechanism involves the formation of a small group of specialized cells that inform neighbouring cells about their position and fate. We have found such an ?organizer? in the middle of the embryonic forebrain which, we have shown, has a crucial influence on the growth and development of a major part of the forebrain. Our work in this new programme is to investigate many of the processes involved in forebrain development in this new light. We will look for new genes involved in the control of these processes and test the function of these, and genes we already know of, using zebrafish and chick embryos in which we can readily suppress gene activity or activate genes in the wrong cells --- both approaches give significant information on what a particular gene does. This work will enhance our understanding of normal brain development, and therefore give insight into developmental malformation; it will also contribute to understanding the developmental history of region-specific neuronal cell types, essential for the future of stem cell therapy for brain degeneration or injury.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0601064","grantId":"G0601064","fundValue":"2137280","fundStart":"2007-09-01","fundEnd":"2013-05-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Andrew Gino Lumsden","coPersons":["Corinne  Houart"],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
