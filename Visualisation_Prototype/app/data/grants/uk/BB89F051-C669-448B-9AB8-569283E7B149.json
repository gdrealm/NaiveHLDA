Their popularity is due to their robustness against bursts of errors and the availability of efficient decoding algorithms. However, future storage applications require dramatic increases in storage capacity and consequently higher data transfer rates. To achieve the desired performance with Reed-Solomon codes, more complicated decoding strategies are being designed, increasing complexity, and as storage capacities continue to increase in the future it will eventually become infeasible to use these codes. Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) codes could be an alternative coding scheme since they have excellent error correcting capabilities at high code rates. We also wish to investigate a class of codes called algebraic-geometric (AG) codes, which have much greater lengths than Reed-Solomon codes and consequently larger Hamming distances. These codes outpeform Reed-Solomon codes and are capable of correcting very large bursts of errors, which commonly occur in storage channels. This project will develop a number of different decoding strategies using AG and LDPC codes with low complexity combined with coded modulation and equalisation that will outperform the current error-correction schemes chosen for the next generation of storage devices.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D058813/1","grantId":"EP/D058813/1","fundValue":"193499","fundStart":"2006-04-01","fundEnd":"2009-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Rolando  Carrasco","coPersons":["Satnam Singh Dlay"],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
