It is based on the chemical attachment of adamantane, the smallest diamond structured molecule available. This molecule will act as a seed for diamond growth, allowing the growth of very thin diamond films at previously unreachably low temperatures. It also offers the possibility of diamond epitaxy, i.e. the growth of single crystal diamond on silicon. This would offer a new source of high quality diamond for industry over large areas.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K007459/1","grantId":"EP/K007459/1","fundValue":"580344","fundStart":"2013-04-22","fundEnd":"2017-04-21","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Oliver Aneurin Williams","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
