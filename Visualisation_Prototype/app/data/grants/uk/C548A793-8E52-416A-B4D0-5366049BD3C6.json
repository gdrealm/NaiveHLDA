Unlike other forms of electrochemical storage, flow batteries are characterised by the ability to de-couple power and energy, allowing significant cost savings as energy requirements increase, and offering the potential for MW/MWhr scale storage. Considerable progress has been made on this technology recent years, especially within China and the UK, but challenges remain to understand and improve lifetime and performance in the currently used all vanadium approach, and to explore novel approaches which offer significantly reduced cost. This proposal addresses the issue of both cost, performance and lifetime within flow batteries, to develop significantly improved all vanadium systems, and to explore novel approaches.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/L014289/1","grantId":"EP/L014289/1","fundValue":"940689","fundStart":"2014-06-30","fundEnd":"2017-06-29","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Nigel Peter Brandon","coPersons":["Paul  Shearing","Anthony  Kucernak","Daniel  Brett"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
