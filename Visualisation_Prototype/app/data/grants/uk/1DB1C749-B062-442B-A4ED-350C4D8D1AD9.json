Academic research into the action of wound healing maggot enzymes in tissue culture performed at the University of Nottingham has revealed that a serine proteinase, identified and cloned, has potential to modify cell behaviour conducive to improved wound healing. Other distinct enzymes have been identified, with anti-microbial activities, which would complement the wound healing process. We seek to translate these findings, by incorporation of maggot enzymes into systems to preserve these bioactive wound healing molecules for delivery to the wound. A defined end user is willing and able to translate this technology to patients. We present a Science To Business application, taking peer reviewed research from bench to clinic in order to fill a void in the wound care market.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=DT/E006698/1","grantId":"DT/E006698/1","fundValue":"411901","fundStart":"2006-11-01","fundEnd":"2009-02-28","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"David Idris  Pritchard","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
