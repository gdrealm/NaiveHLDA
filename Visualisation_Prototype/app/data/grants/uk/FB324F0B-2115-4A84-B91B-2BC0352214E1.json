This intensive research has already produced new treatments for blindness. UK and Japanese scientists are now growing adult stem cells taken from donor corneas (the transparent tissue at the front of the eye) on specialised membranes to create new functional tissue. These regenerated tissues are then transplanted onto the surface of diseased or injured eyes leading to a restoration of the patients' sight. The use of human stem cells need not be limited to clinical theraputic use i.e. aimed at re-establishing vision in humans, they can aslo be used to significantly reduce the number of animals used in medical research. Presently, thousands of rabbits are needed every year to test for the toxic potential of new drugs and cosmetics. The method used in testing on rabbits eyes has changed little over 50 years. Now, by employing the scientific advancements recently made in therapeutic stem cell research to the manufacture of a human tissue based replica in culture, we aim to develop a human stem cell based non-animal alternative to drug and nanomaterial testing. The advantages of this are primarily that the effect of new chemicals/materials can be assessed without any animals being harmed and since the replica tissue is formed from human stem cells the results are also more representative. Furthermore, our non-animal model can assess water insoluble materials such as nanomaterials, something the animal models can not do well. To develop a human stem cell based non-animal alternative to drug testing we will essentially recreate the surface of the human eye in a plastic dish. Using adult stem cells isolated from adult corneal donor tissue and building upon the techniques sucessfully employed for corneal stem cell transplantation, we will identify a suitable protocol and substrate capable of both supporting the formation of a functional corneal epithelium in vitro and being easily sourced. The suitability of the newly developed human stem cell based non-animal alternative to drug testing will be established by vigorous testing of the model's response to known toxic and non-toxic agents. The model's response to toxicity testing will be robustly assessed by microscopy and established toxicity assays.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F019742/1","grantId":"BB/F019742/1","fundValue":"330805","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-09-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Findings formed part of patent application and several publications.

Our method retains cells in a physiological and functional state. So far we have used this method to tissue engineer two important tissues (ocular surface and fetal membrane). The method and creation of an artificial ocular surface has been granted patent protection. The patent covers the use of this construct for clinical transplantation to the cornea and ocular toxicity testing as an alternative to animal testing. The method has also enabled the creation of a powerful new corneal model that for the first time can begin to investigate the effect of collagen density and ECM stiffness on both epithelial and stromal stem cell differentiation. \n\nWe have created a way to produce collagen substrates with tractable stiffness and importantly de-couple topography from the changes in stiffness (i.e. fibrillar collagen substrates with different mechanical properties but the same surface topography). With this technology we can now design tissue constructs with pre-defined levels of cellular differentiation in the final product. This is important because in situ any tissue will have an established ratio between undifferentiated and differentiated cell types, with our technology we can now facilitate this. We can also use this to model the effect of substrate stiffness on cell behaviour and investigate the importance of a soft tissues mechanical properties to its function. \n\nFinally we have discovered that a dehydrated collagen gel can replace the use of amniotic membrane in ocular surface repair. We have recently discovered that it is the amniotic membranes mechanical properties which give it its therapeutic effect and that by tuning the stiffness of our collagen gels to that of amniotic membrane and similar therapeutic effect should be made. Therefore defined collagen gels with a suitable stiffness could replace the use of poorly defined amniotic membrane for ocular surface repair. Our improved ocular surface model illicts more accurate results when compared to current oculotoxicity tests. Therefore could be used an improved drug toxicity test. An International patent has been awarded for an ocular graft for use as a toxicity test or corneal replacement.\nWe are now using the collagen constructs as model of tissue compliance for ongoing MRC grant. Without this model we would not have been able to recreate different levels of tissue stiffness.\nAlso Queen Marys University are now also using this model Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
