Prior to this project, the study of face matching had been conducted mostly in the laboratory. Here we were able to compare face matching in the lab, with matching in real-world situations where people present their photos for verification. Similarly-poor levels of performance were observed in both settings, confirming that this is a significant problem for security.\nCan we improve photographic ID? An explicit aim of the project was to establish whether matching performance could be improved by substituting average faces or cropped faces for standard ID photos. We observed a small but reliable advantage for both types of modified photo in the lab. However, this advantage was not observed in the real- world settings. This is an important divergence, and requires further investigation.\nCan we improve the performance of viewers? In this project, we established, for the first time, that unfamiliar face matching can be significantly improved through training. We used a simple item-by-item feedback regime in a face matching task, and showed very significant improvement by viewers. This effect seems to have its source in viewers’ over-estimation of their own performance – often assuming they have made a correct match when they have not. The feedback causes self-reflection, which in turn improves performance. Our research has had impact in two major ways.\nProfessionals using face matching. A great many professional groups rely, to some extent, on face matching to support security. The work here demonstrates the unreliability of unfamiliar face matching, and this is a message which is beginning to be understood in professional circles. However, it is important to observe that there are cultural issues involved in any professional practice, and we cannot claim to have changed professional behaviour overnight. Nevertheless, the importance of our findings is beginning to be understood by these groups.\nFace matching as evidence. Psychologists have a long history of applying their findings to legal settings, and we had the opportunity during this project to collaborate with an international group of lawyers based in Australia (which has similar judicial procedures to the UK for identification evidence). This resulted in the article listed below, published in a legal journal, and reaching exactly the important target audience for this type of work. Our finding, essentially, is that human performance in identification is much less reliable than people have imagined – even when there is no reliance on memory.
