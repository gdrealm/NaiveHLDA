{"id":"9E00841E-B579-4019-87C9-0C6E2D1B881B","title":"The Convective Storm Initiation Project: Further Analysis","abstractText":"The Convective Storm Initiation Project (CSIP) was an international field campaign designed to observe the processes responsible for the initiation of convection in the UK. It was highly successful and provided unparallelled observations with which to understand and quantify these processes. This proposal will address specific objectives that have arisen from experience gained in the field campaign and from initial analysis of the data gathered. It will produce an understanding of the mechanisms that cause the initiation of convection which will be used by scientists within the Joint Centre for Mesoscale Modelling (JCMM) branch of the Met Office in the development of the Unified Model. The objectives will be achieved by analysing and synthesising CSIP data alongside modelling activities focussed on interpreting the data.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/E006124/1","grantId":"NE/E006124/1","fundValue":"331136","fundStart":"2007-08-31","fundEnd":"2011-03-02","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Alan  Blyth","coPersons":["Douglas  Parker"],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
