{"id":"E464E740-241F-4CFA-AA5E-CA6DD8A7DED7","title":"The Economics of Broadcasting in the Digital Age","abstractText":"<p>The research project is to develop formal economic models to inform policy towards broadcasting following the advent of digital technologies. </p>\n\n<p>First, it examines the provision of high quality programming by commercial broadcasters under alternative funding mechanisms, advertising and pay-TV, and when the number of channels is fixed or (potentially) unlimited. In addition, the scope for a public broadcaster to improve market outcomes may be assessed.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, it explores the nature and source of economic rents in broadcasting. One key issue is the extent to which programme content rights have taken over from transmission bottlenecks as the main source of market power in the industry. The research will critically examine the validity of this presumption, and consider implications for the future development of the industry.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-1590","grantId":"RES-000-22-1590","fundValue":"47019","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2006-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Helen Frances Weeds","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Essex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
