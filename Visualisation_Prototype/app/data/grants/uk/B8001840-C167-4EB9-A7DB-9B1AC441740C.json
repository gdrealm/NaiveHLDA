Layered 4d transition metal oxides (TMOs) based on ruthenium and rhodium ions are particularly attractive systems to study this problem because they can be grown with unrivaled purity and exhibit a wealth of subtle quantum many-body states. It is proposed to investigate such states by angular resolved photoemission (ARPES). This will provide new insight into fundamental questions underlying the physics of 4d TMOs and may shed light on a variety of poorly understood phases in cuprates and manganites.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F006640/1","grantId":"EP/F006640/1","fundValue":"290064","fundStart":"2008-03-10","fundEnd":"2011-03-09","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Our findings have stimulated progress in the understanding of several strongly correlated transition metal oxides including high-temperature superconductors.
