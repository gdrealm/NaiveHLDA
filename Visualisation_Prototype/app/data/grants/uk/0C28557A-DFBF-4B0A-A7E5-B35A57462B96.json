Wilders had a hard time finding a broadcaster or internet provider willing to air the film, because his mere idea caused an immense global controversy, leading to death treats, violent protest, diplomatic incidents and fierce public debate. One of the reactions consisted of organised and unorganised video protest by young people from all over the world, who uploaded their reactions to websites such as YouTube or LiveLeak. These videos form the material for this research project and enable the description of the visual resources young women and men use to perform their religious and public identities, the articulation of their motives and beliefs with their particular visual styles, and the exploration of the type of arguments that visual culture allows for in religious and public debate. \\n\\nThe research will contribute to academic work on youth and religion in three ways: first it will provide more insight into the mediation and public performance of the young religious self, processes which are usually less publicly visible and restrictred to situated local and religious contexts. Second, most studies about young people and religion have been carried out in the Psychology discipline focusing mainly on Christian religions. While young people of all religious and non-religous backgrounds posted their Fitna-videos, the focus of this study is on Islam, and the political and cultural battle surrounding it, therewith providing a relatively exceptional entry to the study of youth and religion. Third, the Fitna-battle was as much a political and social struggle as a religious one. This combination takes this study into the wider field of public sphere studies amd theories, which assumes traditionally a literate, informed and rational public. The increasing public importance of both religion and visual culture has challenged these assumptions and necessitated the question of whether and how they can be incorporated in public debate. \\n\\nThe research will be carried out in an interpretative research design, in which videos, background information, email interviews and contrasting online written texts will form the body of material, approached through qualitative methods of data gathering, and discursive and semiotic methods of data analysis. \\n\\nThe research team consists of a principal and a co-investigator, and a postdoctoral research assistant, who together will produce seven journal articles, op-ed contributions to newspapers, and a dedicated website with a selection of typical videos and research output.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/G016631/1","grantId":"AH/G016631/1","fundValue":"81321","fundStart":"2009-05-01","fundEnd":"2010-04-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  Since our grant conditions did not stipulate impact strategies yet, we have been relatively modest in aiming at wide impact.

This suggests that silence, or a 'cordon sanitaire' around Islamaphobia and its proponents is counterproductive;\n\n\n\n- otherwise inactive youth, both from Muslim and non-Muslim backgrounds, felt forced by the release of Fitna and its demagogic content to make a video and insert themselves in public debate. First, Fitna and the ensuing debate mobilized young people to act as citizens, including an exceptional case of young Egyptian women claiming their right to speak in both global debate and the Muslim Ummah online, and second, YouTube in particular offers a unique space for young people to express their religious and political views in their own multimedially inspired and coded ways;\n\n\n\n- YouTube also provides a global platform to youth across the globe, whose choice of this medium and videos (mostly done in English) testify of a desire to 'speak' to a global audience. This holds especially for Muslim YouTubers, who on the whole adopt a more open, 'cosmopolitan' attitude in the debate, than those with a western background, and/or performing a political identity. \n\n\n\nOur study furthermore contributes to the creation of a wider understanding of how individual Muslims experience and understand their religion, an understanding which is often lost in the dichotomies of public debate. Our talks at different universities showed how much students appreciated the research for enhancing an understanding of diversity within Islam. Further uses of the research would be possible among other communities of Muslims and non-Muslims. \n\nOur participation in different Religion and Society Program events, also showed a considerable interest of journalists and other media makers in our outcomes. The research could be further exploited in this context too. Communities and Social Services/Policy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software)","dataset":"gtr"}
