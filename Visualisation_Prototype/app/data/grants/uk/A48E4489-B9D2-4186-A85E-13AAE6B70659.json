With the move to small screen size, low connection speeds, and different ways of interacting, all Mobile device users effectively suffer the sensory and cognitive impairments normally only experienced by disabled users.The research we propose will investigate the use of Web documents and parts of those documents in order to ensure device independence and place the Mobile Web in a position to access the entire Web. We assert that if the Web is accessible then it is also Mobile, and will validate our assertions by running a series of repeating experiments, testing the results of these experiments against our objectives, and using the results to refine our models and software tools.Thus RIAM has four major aims:(1) To review current guidelines, best practices, and techniques related to Web page interaction and to the intersection between these guidelines, practices, and techniques.(2) Use the results of this research to design a system allowing the Accessible Web and Mobile Web to interoperate.(3) To devise a framework and strategy to migrate this research into the Mobile Web domain; and(4) To develop an automatable validation methodology (and Key Performance Indicators) to test a Web Document's device independence (ergo its suitability for the Mobile Web) based on research from the Accessible Web.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E002218/1","grantId":"EP/E002218/1","fundValue":"209401","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  We transferred our work to the pre-existing Barrier Walkthrough Method (derived from SAMBA and LIFT); a manual process representing the 'spirit of the law'.

We augmented, and combined, current accessibility and mobile Web guidelines with those derived from empirical evidence. Thereby placing existing empirical evidence in support of current guidelines and enabling the formulation of new ones. We combined these sets of guidelines into one holistic framework; demonstrating the reciprocity between guidelines and impairments by adding mobility as an additional situationally induced impairment, and disseminating this information via the W3C Standards Process. This framework was then transferred to the pre-existing Barrier Walkthrough Method (derived from SAMBA and LIFT); a manual process representing the 'spirit of the law'. The guidelines that could be tested automatically where then transferred to the W3C's mobileOK Checker and the complete set was transferred to the eclipse ACT Framework; an automated validation engine representing the 'letter of the law'. To support our assertions of interoperability, we tested the difference between physically disabled uses and mobile users, finding that both magnitude and extent of the in-accessibility were the same in both groups when the mobile users were moving. This lead us to suggest future work - which we have exploited with industry via the TEOA project.\n\nTEOA: Text Entry For Older Adults: One Research Associate – 01 Oct 2011 to 30 June 2012; EPSRC Knowledge Transfer Award (EP/H500154/1–R113685); &pound;29,205 (Research Body Contribution) / &pound;6,000 (Buttercup Telecoms Contribution) / &pound;8,700 (CTIC Contribution) / &pound;4,779 (Age Concern Contribution); Knowledge Transfer Awards Program. Proposes an assessment of the feasibility of moving prototypical user input (users supplied via Age Concern) error correction technology from the mobile Web to the MyMobileWeb platform initiated by Telefonica/O2, with development continued by CTIC with Buttercups Business Cases, thereby enabling all mobile applications can take advantage of reduced error rates. All Technical Reports, Data, and Code are held in an Open Archive. We have contributed to the creation of two major W3C standards documents (http://www.w3.org/WAI/mobile/experiences and http://www.w3.org/TR/mwbp-wcag/) as well as a modified W3C mobileOK validation engine and eclipse framework via the ACTF project (http://www.eclipse.org/actf/). We have lead two tutorials focusing on the subject of RIAM and have authored two book chapters to disseminate our work to academics, researchers, and industrial developers. In addition, we have released a number of user focused articles gaining over thirty stories in the national and international press.
