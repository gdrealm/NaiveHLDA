{"id":"C9E5E9A0-F351-4DC9-BC86-EB3F2EE94642","title":"Assessing the bi-polar nature of productive and counterproductive behaviour at work across four countries","abstractText":"<p>This project examines employee perceptions of productive (eg being courteous, helpful and putting in extra effort) and counterproductive (eg theft, verbal abuse, bullying) workplace behaviour and explores whether they are bi-polar (opposing ends of the same continuum) or multi-dimensional (separate but related concepts). Additionally, the research is framed within a cross-cultural context (UK, The Netherlands, Turkey and Greece) to examine the potential impact of differing values, beliefs and norms on perceptions and extent of engagement in productive and counterproductive behaviour. A two-stage methodology is employed. This commences with a series of semi-structured interviews to assess employee experiences and perceptions of productive and counterproductive work behaviour across the four countries. Next, an online questionnaire is administered to samples of employees within the four countries. Analysis of the structure of a scale measuring productive and counterproductive behaviour and relationships between factors within the scale and perceptions of organisational stressors, emotions and organisational identification shall be adopted to examine if a bi-polar relationship exists. This project has the potential to advance theory and research within productive and counterproductive work behaviour as well as to promote the use of more effective interventions to encourage productive behaviour and reduce counterproductive behaviour.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F000979/1","grantId":"ES/F000979/1","fundValue":"199050","fundStart":"2008-01-01","fundEnd":"2010-01-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Iain John Coyne","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
