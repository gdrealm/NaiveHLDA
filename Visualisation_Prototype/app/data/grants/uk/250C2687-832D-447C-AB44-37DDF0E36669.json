Furthermore, it will increase public understanding of the science associated with observing the stars, planets, comets and meteors. The show will be developed for small horizontal domes and portable planetaria, and provided free-of-charge to operators around the UK, meeting a current gap in provision.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/L001586/1","grantId":"ST/L001586/1","fundValue":"9996","fundStart":"2013-07-21","fundEnd":"2014-03-20","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Simon  Jago","coPersons":["Paul  Roche"],"organisation":"Techniquest","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
