The cuccess of this enterprise depends on our having computer models of the Galaxy that we can `survey' in the way the satellite is going to survey the Galaxy. This proposal is to use a new technology to construct such models, and use them to predict what the satellite will see.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=PP/D001242/1","grantId":"PP/D001242/1","fundValue":"180731","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"James Jeffrey Binney","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
