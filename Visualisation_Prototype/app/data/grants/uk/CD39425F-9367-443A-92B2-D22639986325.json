The main challenges towards a comprehensive understanding and experimental realization of nonlinear optical properties of metamaterials are that a theory of surface and bulk nonlinear optics of metamaterials is yet to be developed, and a practical means to fabricate and test such a theory are missing as well. The main goal of this research program is to achieve these milestones. The program synergistically matches three collaborators, two in the UK and one in the US, with an established record of collaboration to investigate the properties and materials strategies for fabricating these materials. The central rationale for the group is that the UK group provides strong theoretical and fabrication capabilities while the US group provides fabrication, optical testing, and materials capabilities. In addition, we will make use of local instrumentation capabilities in both the UK and the US to fabricate and test these materials. The program is constructed to enable travel to and from each country by students and to a more limited extent the professors. The research to be undertaken here has several areas of broad impact. First, it is a project, which will foster an interdisciplinary examination of the fundamental materials science of artificial metamaterials, which includes fabrication, materials physics, optical physics, and theory. Second it will enable two groups in the US and the UK, with a strong history of interactions and complementary expertise and capabilities to collaborate. This work will involve the opportunity for both graduate and undergraduate students to collaborate and travel in an international setting. Third, the program has concrete plans and procedures to seek out recruitment of diverse student collaborators. Our immediate record in this area is strong including one woman PhD student in theory and two undergraduates. Recruitment for this program will be done via four outreach talks to undergrads at Columbia in Electrical Engineering and Applied Physics and Applied Mathematics Departments every year via active participation in research opportunities for undergraduates and undergraduate research opportunities program at Columbia. Fourth, the project will enable students to collaborate via extended visits and shorter trips with a major National Laboratory, i.e. Brookhaven, in their new Nanocenter, which one of the PIs was the founding director, as well as the London Centre for Nanotechnology, a facility shared by the University College London and Imperial College London.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G030502/1","grantId":"EP/G030502/1","fundValue":"182013","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  We are currently exploring commercialization avenues of OPTIMET, a software tool for modelling linear and non-linear optical properties of photonic metamaterials.

The research programme synergistically\nmatched three collaborators, two in the UK and one in the US, with an established record of collaboration to investigate the\nproperties and materials strategies for fabricating non-linear optical meta-materials.\nAs generic examples of non-linear meta-materials we have considered plasmonic meta-materials made of arrays of\nmetallic resonators and dielectric photonic crystals made of silicon. In particular, we have developed fabrication techniques\nfor plasmonic meta-materials and have investigated a series of linear and non-linear optical properties of the fabricated\nplasmonic nano-structures, including polarisation-dependent effects in plasmonic meta-surfaces, engineering of optical\nabsorption in plasmonic meta-materials and the influence of the properties of the primary unit cell (e.g., chirality) on the\nsecond-harmonic generation in plasmonic meta-surfaces. We have also studied the optical properties of photonic crystal\nslab waveguides, fabricated onto the silicon-on-insulator materials platform, which within a specific range of frequencies\nwould have negative effective index of refraction, i.e., a photonic crystal based negative index meta-material. Such highindex-\ncontrast photonic crystals have strongly modified, tuneable dispersion properties, and thus are an excellent medium\nfor exploring new linear and non-linear phenomena in negative index materials. To this end, we have demonstrated that\nsuch photonic crystals can be used to achieve a new type of meta-material, i.e., a meta-material with zero index of\nrefraction. Equally important, our research programme had a strong theoretical component, too. Thus, we have developed\na comprehensive theory of light propagation in photonic crystal slab waveguides made of silicon, which describes the\noptical pulse dynamics both in the regular and slow-light regime. Moreover, we have developed a new numerical method\nthat allowed us to model both the surface and bulk contributions to the second-harmonic generation in plasmonic metamaterials.\nThe numerical algorithm has been implemented in a high-performance parallel code (OPTIMET), which has\nbeen subsequently used to study the non-linear properties of several types of plasmonic structures and their applications to\nultra-compact sensing devices. Our theoretical work on plasmonic nano-structures has also led to the first theoretical\ndemonstration of the existence of sub-wavelength plasmonic lattice solitons and plasmonic vortices in one- and twodimensional\narrays of metallic nanowires. The results obtained as part of this research programme have been published in\na series of high-impact journals, including Nature Photonics, Physical Review Letters, Optics Letters and ACS Nano.\nImportantly, this research project has facilitated the establishment of several new fruitful collaborations with research\ngroups at Columbia University, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven and Shanghai Jiao Tong University.\nEqually important, this project has had a very strong educational component, providing ample opportunities for graduate\nstudents and post-graduate researchers to collaborate in an international setting. This collaborative work has been highly\ninterdisciplinary, bringing together a graduate student specialising in the development of advanced high-performance\ncomputational code and device modelling, one graduate student and a post-graduate researcher whose work focused on\noptical characterisation of the fabricated meta-materials and two graduate students who have been involved in all the fabrication aspects of the project. We are currently exploring commercialization avenues of OPTIMET, a software tool for modelling linear and non-linear optical properties of photonic metamaterials. This software tool has been developed as part of this research project.
