The funding allowed us to buy additional equipment to upgrade our existing confocal microscopes, so that we could improve our imaging. These microscopes are used by over 20 different research groups within the Faculty of Biological Sciences at the University, and have supported a wide range of research, from imaging organelles and how they move in living plants, to imaging receptors in mammalian cells. The research can be used by those interested in developing treatments for infections and disease (e.g. pharma companies, clinicians). Imaging is central to understanding the healthy human organism, plants and animals. Without knowledge of how things work, it is very difficult to understand what goes wrong in disease states. The new microscopes are essential for using imaging to understand cellular processes, and in detecting what goes wrong in diseases from virus infections, to inherited mutant Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
