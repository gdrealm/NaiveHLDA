Existing research demonstrates associations between social participation and attributes such as gender, age and social class. However, much less is known about the mechanisms behind these associations. The use of longitudinal data from the 1958 British Birth Cohort Study together with qualitative data from interviews with a sample of 180 cohort members will provide insights into the processes and mechanisms that explain why some individuals exhibit much higher levels of associational membership and social engagement than others. In particular, use of the life history data from NCDS including work histories, relationship histories and fertility histories will enable us to take a life course perspective on social participation and to investigate how changes in different life domains may impact on an individual's participation in social activities such as membership of voluntary groups etc. In addition, analysis of qualitative data collected in biographical retrospective interviews will facilitate a better understanding of how individuals conceptualise their own motivations for participation in organisations and voluntary groups and how this has varied over their lives so far.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E018599/1","grantId":"ES/E018599/1","fundValue":"243861","fundStart":"2007-12-01","fundEnd":"2010-05-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Jane  Elliott","coPersons":["Mike Antony Savage"],"organisation":"Institute of Education","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
