It pays particular attention to the influence of family life and the pressures of civilian employment on the decisions that reservists make about their commitment to serving and intentions to remain in the Reserves, because the Army is becoming increasingly reliant on reservists at a time when changes to employment patterns and family life may also be placing greater pressure on reservists.\n\nSince the invasion of Iraq in March 2003, more than 27,000 reservists have been used in military operations. Though the Army has relied more and more on volunteer reserves, their numbers have declined sharply over the last two decades. This is significant, because planned reforms of size and structure of the British Army mean that the Army has been tasked with significantly increasing the size of the Reserves to make up for personnel and capability shortfalls, resulting from current and future defence cuts. Although some politicians have suggested that recruiting and retaining more reservists is about fostering greater understanding of and support for the military in wider society, the everyday economic and social challenges that reservists face in balancing their military service with civilian jobs and family life need to be considered in more depth. There have not been any prior major British studies analysing these issues specifically among reservists.\n\nThe Army's increased reliance on reservists has also come at a time when families may be under increased financial pressure due to recession, inflation and social spending cuts. Though this may motivate some people to join the Reserves to earn additional money, reserve service has to be balanced with other roles. One of these is roles within the family itself. Many families, either with or without children, rely on two incomes which can make childcare, other family care commitments and housework harder to balance with commitments outside of the home. Another is civilian employment which the majority of reservists are engaged in, where there has been a growth of evening and weekend working and the rise of a long-hours working culture. These family and employment issues are likely to influence the ability of reservists to commit to the Army and to carry on serving in the Reserves. In order to ascertain what reservists think about balancing competing role commitments and demands and how this might affect their reserve service, this project focuses on their perceptions and experiences and those of their families.\n\nBy observing reservists during Reserve training exercises and by interviewing them and members of their families, we will provide in-depth insights into how reservists and their families perceive and experience the potential challenges of reserve service for family life and civilian employment. We will also be able to examine how and why reservists think that their commitment to the Army may be influenced by their competing roles and pressures. The research is likely to have important implications for the Army's plans to restructure, because it will identify key issues that affect the reservist's commitment to the Army. It will also be valuable to reservists themselves and their families because it will help them to consider how they and other reservists cope with competing demands on their time. Finally, the research will offer insights into wider social change in relation to defence, families and employment that will raise important questions about the nature of modern British society.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L013029/1","grantId":"ES/L013029/1","fundValue":"243837","fundStart":"2014-09-01","fundEnd":"2017-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Sergio  Catignani","coPersons":["Victoria Marie  Basham"],"organisation":"University of Exeter","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
