A comparative analysis of Asian and African elephant based ecotourism","abstractText":"<p>This research project has a number of core objectives centred on the development of conceptual academic debates, and the ways in which such theoretical debates can be traced, refined, critiqued and challenged through engagement with specific locations and specific ecotourism practices. This research project will examine whether ecotourism is a process which is both reflective of and constitutive of global trends in neoliberalisation; in short its core question is: does ecotourism neoliberalise nature? In order to do this, it will investigate the ways that ecotourism might be a force for extending and deepening market based systems of natural resource management to an increasing range of both human (emotions and expectations) and non-human phenomena. This project will focus specifically on whether the ways that a number of ecotourist sites and experiences centre on interactions with large charismatic animals (elephants) as a mechanism through which non-human nature and human emotions and experiences are neoliberalised (Castree, 2003; Castree, 2007; Bulbeck, 2005).</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F029454/1","grantId":"ES/F029454/1","fundValue":"76884","fundStart":"2007-12-01","fundEnd":"2008-11-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  The findings have been used to develop debates on the inter relationships between neoliberalism and nature.

The project examined the conceptual debates on neoliberalisation and commodification,whch then provided a framework for understanding how tourism might be a mechanism through which nature gets increasingly 'neoliberalised'. In theoretical terms 'neoliberalising nature' is related to wider debates about neoliberalism. There is no clear and universally accepted definition of neoliberalism, but in general, it is regarded as a process by which market-based regulation is expanded, the role of the state is reduced, and a complex array of public-private networks operate together to commodify nature (McCarthy and Prudham, 2004: 275-277; also see Liverman, 2004; Harvey 2005; O'Neill, 2007; Peck and Tickell, 2002). In terms of thinking about how nature might be being neoliberalised, Castree (2008) argues that an increasing range of non-human phenomena have been neoliberalised, where they are subject to an expanding variety of market based systems of management. The aim of the research was to analyse how the clean lines of theoretical models (Castree, 2008) are challenged and contested by their encounter with the material realities of the nature based tourism industry. The project took a grounded theory approach, which allowed us to examine the complex inter-relationships between debates about the neoliberalisation of nature and the practices of the elephant-based tourism industry, specifically the use of captive elephants to allow tourists to engage in close encounters such as riding, washing, feeding elephants as well as watching them paint, play musical instruments or displaying logging skills. In conceptual terms, our analysis of the elephant riding tourism industry revealed that the neoliberalisation of nature is highly varied and diverse, and our understandings of neoliberalism are rendered more complex through an appreciation of these variations. It is clear that while the neoliberalisation of nature might be though of as increasingly pervasive, elephants are commodified and neoliberalised in different ways as a result of their local social, political and economic contexts. This demonstrates the need for a more nuanced understanding of the neoliberalisation of nature which allows for an analysis of its contours, boundaries, limitations: in essence the ways it is contested and challenged on the ground.
