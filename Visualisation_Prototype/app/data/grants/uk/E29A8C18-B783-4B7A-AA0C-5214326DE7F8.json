{"id":"E29A8C18-B783-4B7A-AA0C-5214326DE7F8","title":"Workshop on Triangulations and Mutations","abstractText":"In many branches of mathematics, a recurring theme is to find a combinatorial object that can be used as a handle to describe a deeper, more fundamental mathematical theory and turn certain questions about it into problems that can actually be calculated. \n\nOne example is triangulations of surfaces. If we divide a surface, say a sphere or a donut, into triangular regions, then the geometry of the surface (which is potentially complicated) can be understood in terms of which triangular regions are incident to each other (and this is much simpler).\n\nCombinatorial objects also occur in the context of generating objects of categories such as strong exceptional sequences or tilting objects, crepant resolutions of singularities, and vanishing cycles of Lefschetz fibrations. Recently, it has been observed that these combinatorial objects have remarkably similar properties which are independent from the branch of mathematics in which the were developed. On one hand, they can be constructed by finding maximal cliques of subobjects that satisfy certain compatibility relations. On the other hand, once one has obtained such a combinatorial object, it is possible to generate more by a process that swaps one of its subobjects for another one.\n\nWe use mutation as a generic term for these processes which go by different names in different branches of mathematics: Flops, Fomin-Zelevinsky mutations, twists etc. In the case of triangulations of surfaces, we have a particularly simple description: If we remove the border between two neighbouring triangular regions, then we create a quadrangular region, and there is a unique alternative border (linking the two other corners) which divide it into two new triangular regions. This is the fundamental instance of mutation.\n\nClearly, these observations suggest that there must be an underlying mathematical theory that ties all this neatly together, and the purpose of the workshop is to bring together researchers to discuss these questions.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K003720/1","grantId":"EP/K003720/1","fundValue":"15912","fundStart":"2012-10-02","fundEnd":"2014-03-01","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Niels Peter  Jorgensen","coPersons":["Stefan  Kolb"],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":" The EPSRC grant supported the &quot;Workshop on Triangulations and Mutations&quot; which took place in Newcastle 18-22 March 2013 with 52 delegates. The first day of the workshop also served as the Northern Regional Meeting of the London Mathematical Society and was funded with &pound;7,500 by that organisation. The afternoon of the first day had colloquium style talks, accessible to a more general audience.\n\n\n\nThe key theme of the workshop was the interaction of combinatorics and deeper, more fundamental mathematical theories, in particular the prospect for combinatorics to be used as a handle to facilitate concrete computations. \n\n\n\nSome examples mentioned in the original application were tilting objects and mutation, as well as crepant resolutions of singularities. They lend a strong combinatorial flavour to topics of representation theory and geometry; in particular, they relate to the theory of triangulations of surfaces which are pivotal to recent developments in both areas.\n\n\n\nThe key gain made in the workshop was to bring together a diverse group of researchers, all of whom work in this area, and allow them to interact for a week. A number of new trends emerged in the talks and generated a high level of interest in the audience, and we will single out two.\n\n\n\n(1) New categorifications of cluster algebras (Baur, Br&uuml;stle, King, Leclerc). It has been well understood for at while how cluster algebras are categorified by the cluster categories defined by Buan, Marsh, Reineke, Reiten, and Todorov, but it is also clear that this categorification suffers from some shortcomings as explained by Nakajima. \n\nThe talk by Bernard Leclerc linked to efforts by Hernandez and Leclerc, and independently by Nakajima, to define abelian categories which categorify cluster algebras in an alternative way.\n\n\n\nThe talks by Baur and King dealt with new Frobenius categories which categorify the coordinate rings of Grassmannians.\n\n\n\nThe talk by Br&uuml;stle was on cluster algebras and cluster categories defined by triangulations of surfaces. It was particularly interesting that the themes of Frobenius categories and infinite clusters occurred in several talks.\n\n \n\n(2) Links with geometry (Felikson, Iyama, Smith, Sutherland, Tumarkin, Wemyss). A number of talks had such links as their major theme.\n\n\n\nFelikson and Tumarkin spoke on different aspects of a joint project which, very surprisingly, goes from cluster algebras through representations of Coxeter groups and culminates in the construction of hyperbolic manifolds of minimal volume.\n\n\n\nIyama and Wemyss likewise spoke on different aspects of their ongoing research project which aims to understand minimal models in algebraic geometry by using non-commutative crepant resolutions. Such resolutions are intimately linked to clusters because they also permit a theory of mutations.\n\n\n\nSmith and Sutherland both spoke on stability conditions, which are important invariants of triangulated categories. They showed how in some settings the space of stability conditions can be identified with a space of quadratic differentials on a Riemann surface. This correspondence links intimately with the &quot;triangulations&quot; theme of the workshop: The trajectories of the quadratic differential give a triangulation of the surface, which provides a quiver and a potential that can be used to construct the heart of the stability condition. Pure mathematical research has a dizzying array of applications to non-academic contexts: matrices were invented for abstract reasons, yet form the mathematical backbone of quantum mechanics which has given us the transistor, the integrated circuit, and, ultimately, the computer.\n\n\n\nMentioning computers, it is natural also to mention the pathbreaking pure mathemcatical research by pioneers like Alan Turing and John von Neumann who investigated problems of logic, yet came up with the fundamentals of computer design.\n\n\n\nThe time horizon for applications of research in pure mathematics can be very long: indeed, centuries passed between Newton's fundamental work on differential and integral calculus and its application to space travel, and it took even longer for Fermat's work on number theory to find its current crucial applications to public key cryptosystems.\n\n\n\nWe are unable to foresee what the practical applications may be of the research of this workshop, but we are convinced that, like most pure mathematics, it has great potential: as explained, research in pure mathematics is a main engine of long term development of our economy. The Workshop had an interdisciplinary purpose, bringing together researchers from geometry, integrable systems, Lie theory, and representation theory who share an interest in cluster theory which is a nexus through which these areas crossfertilize.\n\n\n\nOne of the main purposes of the Workshop was to promote such interaction across disciplines, and the resulting exploitation route is the emerging dynamic and potential new coauthorships between the participants. New results and papers will emerge which would not be possible within each discipline in isolation. Other","dataset":"gtr"}
