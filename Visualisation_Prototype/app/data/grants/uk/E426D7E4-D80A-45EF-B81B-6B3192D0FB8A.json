In the case of welfare state theory and social policy analysis, the macro units are usually either national jurisdictions or policy regimes; explanations concerning the nature and effectiveness of welfare state structures in terms of their outcomes for individuals and communities necessarily depend on systematic cross-national comparison. </p>\n\n<p>The approach adopted in this research project is to combine comparisons of institutional social policy arrangements in a sizeable number (18) of countries with a rigorous analysis of the interaction between institutional arrangements, individuals' behaviour and policy outcomes in a small number (four) of disparate countries and to do so within an integrated modelling framework based on latent concepts, structural equation modelling (SEM) and longitudinal data. <br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-239-25-0029","grantId":"RES-239-25-0029","fundValue":"276698","fundStart":"2010-04-01","fundEnd":"2012-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Martin  Seeleib-Kaiser","coPersons":["Mark  Tomlinson","Robert LLoyd Walker"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
