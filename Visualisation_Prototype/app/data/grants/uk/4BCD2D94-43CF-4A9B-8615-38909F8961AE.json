The centralaspect of the MGS is the training of PhD students in the mathematical foundations of computing, by means of a yearlySpring School that provides a series of technical courses on introductory, advanced and emerging topics.This application is to seek continued EPSRC support for the MGS -- which it has enjoyed in recent years via threesuccessive grants -- by means of funding twenty places for PhD students at the 2010 event, together with support for the invited lecturers, and (as required under full economic costing), the local organisers and thedirector of the MGS. This application will secure the future of the MGS for the next year, and hence contribute tomaintaining the leading position of the UK in theoretical computer science.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H051465/1","grantId":"EP/H051465/1","fundValue":"2893","fundStart":"2010-04-19","fundEnd":"2011-04-18","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The students who participated in MGS went on to develop their own line of research.

All were given by world leading scientists in the field. In addition we had a invited course on &quot;Nominal sets and their application&quot; by Professor Andrew Pitts of the University of Cambridge.\n\nThe event let PhD students and other participants find about the most exciting scientific developments in computer science and interact both with the lecturers and with each other.\n\nThis event contributed to the growth of a fertile scientific community and to the development of the knowledge of young researchers who will be a leading force for UK computer science in the years to come. The event offered advanced training in theoretical computer science to many PhD students. The knowledge the acquired will be very valuable in their future research. Many state-of-the-art topics were treated and stimulated the curiosity of the students.\nWe expect that many of them will be encouraged to develop original ideas and the skills they developed in MGS will allow them to bring those ideas to fruitful results.
