This will combine the functionalities of a high-efficiency cooking stove, an electricity generator and a refrigerator (cool box), referred to as SCORE, and may be fuelled by burning a range of biomass products. The partnership brings together four UK universities, a leading US research centre (Los Alamos National Laboratory), a multi-national electrical goods manufacturer (GP Acoustics), an international charitable organisation (Practical Action), and numerous universities in Africa and Asia. It will also collaborate to ensure that the devices are acceptable at a technological, economic and social level and that there is sufficient scope for the communities to develop numerous businesses from the manufacture, repair and innovative applications of SCORE.The operation of the electricity generating and refrigerator parts of the proposed device will be based on a novel application of thermoacoustic processes. Fundamentally, these rely on the interaction between an acoustic field and solid boundaries, leading to a range of fluid- and thermo-dynamic processes, which do not require harmful working fluids or moving parts in the traditional sense; the electrical power extraction is accomplished by a linear alternator.The concept of the device is based on the proven thermoacoustic Stirling engines and refrigerators developed by Los Alamos, NASA and the US military for applications including: cooling of satellite systems and radar arrays, gas liquefaction and cryogenics, use of waste heat for air conditioning, separation of binary gas mixtures and many others. There is a significant level of innovation in the proposed work in three respects: 1) research into the combination of the thermoacoustic engine, linear alternator and cool box in a single device, powered by a biomass stove, which has not been attempted before,2) design of a rugged and inexpensive linear alternator that could be easily mass-produced, 3) the overall system design from the viewpoint of low cost, application of indigenous materials, use of local manufacturing skills and simplicity of assembly, which are major research issues compared to the high-cost and high-tech thermoacoustic systems produced so far. These challenges form the backbone of the proposed scientific and technological work programme.Within the overall 5-year duration, there will be two stages to this project: the first 3 years will mainly focus on conducting the necessary social and scientific research, while the last 2 years will broadly focus on technology hand-over, including representative field trials and a wide dissemination among target communities.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E044379/2","grantId":"EP/E044379/2","fundValue":"203947","fundStart":"2011-05-01","fundEnd":"2013-01-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The Score project aims to improve the life of over 60 Million people in developing countries. It started as a ?2M research consortium, to significantly improve health, quality of life, economic growth and social and educational opportunities, and thus reduce poverty in sub-Saharan Africa, the Indian sub-continent and South America by understanding the energy needs of their rural communities and working with them to develop the capability to manufacture an affordable versatile domestic appliance.\n \nThere are two major variants of the Score-Stove(TM). Score-Stove(TM)1 is a low-smoke cookstove that does not generate electricity that has been installed in Nepal, Kenya and Zambia. Some installations also have PV cells to generate the electricity. Score-Stove(TM)2 is a low-smoke cookstove that also generates electricity using the thermo-acoustic effect. \nScore-Stove(TM)2 combines the functionality of a high-efficiency cooking stove, with an electricity generator that may be fuelled by burning a range of biomass products. The original Score Team was a research partnership that brought together four UK universities, Nottingham, City University London, Leicester, Queen Mary University of London and NGO (the international charitable organisation Practical Action). The results were disseminated at an international conference in April 2012. www.nottingham.ac.uk/lmh. City University London holds a world first of 23W electrical power from a wood burning thermo-acoustic engine, with new versions being developed.\n \nThe project has now widened to include other interested individuals and organisations in what we call the Score-community. Additionally, a Score-centre comprises a local University and organisation with field experience, normally Practical Action. The purpose of each centre is to adapt the stove for local use, provide training for manufacture and maintenance etc.\n \nThe ongoing goal of the project is to collaborate to ensure that the Score-Stoves are acceptable at a technological, economic and social level and that there is sufficient scope for the poor communities to develop numerous local businesses from the manufacture repair and innovative applications of Score and that the developed world contributes to the overall Score ethos.

The project contributed to increasing wealth and education and improving health in developing countries by investigating appropriate and affordable novel technology to meet the energy needs of isolated rural communities in developing countries. This technology was designated, SCORE, the Stove for Cooking, Refrigeration and Electricity supply.\n\n2. Project Network was developed, comprising academics from both the project team and local universities acting as knowledge hubs in the target countries, charities and non- government organisations, government representative and the\nlocal communities themselves. The scientific, technological and social knowledge required by SCORE has been exchanged. SCORE has been promoted worldwide and provided a database of end-user requirements and product applications.\n\n3. The mechanisms for implementation of SCORE have been planned and created by identifying barriers to implementation and proposing solutions, forming collaborations within the developing countries, developing training strategy and suitable training materials, encouraging the acquisition of matching funding, promoting the building of local manufacturing capacity, and highlighting the wider business opportunities of SCORE in developing countries.\n\n4. The underpinning scientific knowledge of thermoacoustic technologies has been capture and evaluated and a new\nengineering concept combining the thermoacoustic engine, electrical generation and refrigeration has been devised. These have been integrated in technology demonstrators.\n\n5. Heat transfer processes in combustion and thermoacoustic systems have been studied and a high-efficiency, integrated\ncombustor/heat exchanger/stove unit, capable of fulfilling its cooking function and providing the energy to the\nthermoacoustic element has been devised. Its performance has been evaluated by experimentation and integrated it into a technology demonstrator.\n\n6. An inexpensive method to convert acoustic energy into electricity that could be easily mass produced and\nevaluate its performance has been studied.\n\n7. The manufacturability, cost and the potential of using indigenous materials and local skills, labour as well as the\nease of assembly have been studied, and based on the technology demonstrator, feasible SCORE prototypes, which could be field tested at selected locations have been devised. The prototypes have been built and demonstrated in selected rural communities.\n\n8. The designs have been benchmarked against other technologies and future development paths, research and\napplications have been recommended. Thermoacoustic Technologies can be taken forward by numerous users in the energy sector to create inexpensive, low maintenance systems for generating electricity from a range of renewable sources and/or waste heat.
