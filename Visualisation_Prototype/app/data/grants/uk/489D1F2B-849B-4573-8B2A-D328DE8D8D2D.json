Selective and conditional removal of regulator proteins by proteolysis is emerging as a\nmajor regulatory principle in plants. The aim of the N-vironment project is to provide a complete\nmechanistic understanding of the role of the N-end rule pathway of targeted proteolysis in\ncontrolling plant responses to the environment. To achieve this goal consortium partners have been\nselected that represent internationally leading European teams with experience in the pathways\nmultiple facets, including the biochemical basis of the pathway, hypoxia and plant development,\ntranscriptional regulation of stress and metabolic signalling. The project will bring together six\nresearch groups with complementary expertise in fundamental molecular plant science,\nbiochemistry and chemistry, in four institutions. The research programme of the N-vironment\nconsortium will be achieved through six inter-related Work Packages carried out by the four\nconsortium partners (three funded by ERA-CAPS, one associated laboratory). The objectives of these\nwork packages are related to three fundamental questions that arose after integration of the recent\ndiscoveries by consortium members of the role of the N-end rule pathway of targeted proteolysis as a\nmajor regulator of plant development and response to the environment. Question 1: What are the\nprotein substrates and enzymatic components of the N-end rule pathway? Question 2: How is the Nend\nrule pathway integrated into cellular signaling pathways? Question 3: What is the extent of the\nrole of the N-end rule pathway in plant response to the biotic and abiotic environment? The proposed\nresearch has highly innovative measurable outcomes that address this newly discovered area of plant\nbiology, and will uncover: New mechanisms regulating protein stability, new mechanisms of\nenvironmental stress sensing, new functions for proteins in stress sensing, the importance of the\nN-end rule in a key EU crop, tomato. This fast-developing area of plant molecular science is led by\nN-vironment members (including discovery of substrates, methods of entry into the N-end rule\npathway, biochemical components of the pathway), and together with the availability of a large\nnumber of unique resources within the consortium, makes the N-vironment proposal highly novel and\ntimely. The synergistic value of this collaborative programme will be the development and\nexploitation of a highly novel area of plant biology of key importance to agriculture, in which Europe\nhas the capacity to take a world lead through ERA-CAPS funding.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/M002268/1","grantId":"BB/M002268/1","fundValue":"430809","fundStart":"2014-04-11","fundEnd":"2017-04-10","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael  Holdsworth","coPersons":["Rumiana  Ray","Neil  Oldham"],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
