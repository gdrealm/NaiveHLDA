Women's new worlds, shaped by suffrage, the assembly line, cinemas and the 'birth-strike' where built in the shadow of death and uncertainty. 'Ours is the most sexually conscious age' (Virginia Wolf, 1929), a conscientious which 'universally repudiated' the feminine (Freud 1937). These tensions, the conditions which gave rise to them, are explored to through the intimate and political relations of Londoners, throwing new light on the often changes and discontinuities in the emergence of modern Britain.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=113189/1","grantId":"113189/1","fundValue":"15301","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2006-04-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Sally  Alexander","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Goldsmiths College","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
