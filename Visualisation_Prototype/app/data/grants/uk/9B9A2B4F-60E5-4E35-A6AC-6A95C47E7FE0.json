It is widely acknowledged that individuals differ in their attitudes to age but little research has explored the influence of the societal context on these attitudes. Countries within Europe vary considerably in their cultural, socio-economic, and political context and this research will investigate how these different contexts affect and combine with individualsâ€™ views of younger and older people.

Age discrimination was one of the last equality strands to be protected under UK law, with parts of the 2010 legislation only coming into force in 2012. During this period, Age UK has used our evidence on experiences and expressions of ageism to help to demonstrate to Government and policy makers that age continues to be a serious focus of discrimination that requires protection alongside other protected characteristics. We presented our findings to the Age UK Expert Seminar series, and to the Age Action Alliance (AAA), a network of over 500 organisations committed to improving the lives of older people. The AAA use our findings to evidence support for the reduction of ageist attitudes and negative attitudes to age and to promote positive, realistic representations of age in the UK.

Previous research has not used culturally equivalent quantitative methods to explore the influence of the societal context on these attitudes towards age. Using Europe's diverse cultural, socio-economic and political context we used multilevel statistical method to analyse data from the European Social Survey (ESS) module on attitudes to age, designed by our research team. The research questions were intended to test, develop and integrate social psychological and sociological theories that describe attitudes to ageing and older people and to further our understanding of the circumstances that lead to (un)favourable perceptions of age and notions of successful active ageing. \n\nOur findings have been consolidated in the form of three substantial academic publications and several reports and media activities. Our findings challenge extant social and economic theories of age-related attitudes and experiences, showing that differences between individuals and between countries bear differently on successful ageing and wellbeing. \n\nFor instance, Study 1 revealed that a country's GDP disproportionately affects the wellbeing of older people relative to younger people, meaning that the paradox of wellbeing is only observed in countries with higher GDP. Multiple tests showed that this finding cannot be attributed to a host of other factors. These results move theory and research towards new starting assumptions about ageing and well-being. \n\nSwift, H.J., Vauclair, C-M., Abrams, D., Bratt, C., Marques, S., &amp; Lima, M-L. (2014). The paradox of well-being: Effects of age and GDP, Journal of Gerontology B: Psychological &amp; Social Sciences. doi: 10.1093/geronb/gbu011\n\nStudy 2 established that the lower the social status that different countries accord to older people the lower is older people's subjective health. Moreover, supporting a social identity theory account, it is in countries that devalue older people's status that their identification with age is negatively related to their subjective health. These findings have been provisionally accepted for publication as:\n\nMarques, S., Swift, H.J., Vauclair, C-M., Lima, M.L., Bratt, C., &amp; Abrams, D.

Psychology and Health, doi: 10.1080/08870446.2014.938742 \n\nFurther analyses conducted in collaboration with ICSTE tested how income inequality, age discrimination and subjective health are related among people aged 70 and over, and how older people's status is affected by modernisation and by the proportion of older people in employment. \n\nVauclair, C-M., Marques, S., Lima, M.L., Abrams, D., Swift, H.J. &amp; Bratt, C.

The report shows that ageism is a significant source of inequality and unfairness in society, and it has a detrimental impact on performance, productivity and social cohesion. \n\nAbrams, D., &amp; Swift, H.J.
