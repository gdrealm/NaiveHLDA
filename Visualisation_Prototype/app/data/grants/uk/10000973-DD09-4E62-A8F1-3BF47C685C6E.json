Almost 20% of the UK's energy consumption and CO2 emissions arise from non-domestic buildings. Behaviour change initiatives could have a significant impact given current estimates that around 30% of energy in buildings is currently wasted. The aim of the research then is to work with Leicester City Council to develop a set of social media/smartphone tools that the local authority can use to reduce the energy demand across its building stock. This research aims to explore the opportunities for and impact of digital technologies on user-behaviour and energy demand reduction in the non-domestic setting through enabling building users to both understand the environmental impact of their activities and to act in networks through social media applications of the digital technology. \n\nFor example, social media platforms offer building-users the ability to view the energy consumption of the building and offer comment if the consumption is unexpectedly high. Photos or video can be taken and posted of any issues; knowledge can be shared on how best to manage a room's temperature; visitors can share their views and energy managers can share best practice and gain insight from building-users if their building energy management system is flagging up an alert. Importantly the research aims to explore the potential of social media tools to overcome the lack of empowerment many building-users feel in being unable to control or affect the building's energy performance.\n\nFindings from the project should increase understanding on how ICT can help society meet challenging and ambitious carbon reduction targets. Given the high energy demand and carbon footprint of the built environment there is a pressing need to implement effective and affordable energy demand reduction strategies in non-domestic buildings. The potential impact of Gooddeeds then is in finding an affordable ICT based solution for building users to collaborate, share knowledge and mitigate some of the errors inherent in the solely technical approach. This could impact on the way buildings are managed, building energy management systems are operated and how building users experience and perceive buildings. But this is not simply about buildings. Gooddeeds seeks to demonstrate that solutions to the grand challenges of our age will not be resolved by merely 'top down' solutions but by approaches that insist on the engagement and nurturing of active citizens who understand their responsibilities to their environment and to each other, and who act together for the mutual good.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K012312/1","grantId":"EP/K012312/1","fundValue":"181536","fundStart":"2013-03-04","fundEnd":"2014-09-03","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  This project has explored how energy management can be improved through utilising the knowledge within ordinary building users. Social media tools were tested alongside face-to-face public engagement exercises and a building' user group.\n\nImpact is envisaged through contributing to a growing body of research and outputs in this area via academic publications and conference attendance. These have included:\n\nAttending and presenting at the leading EU energy conference: the European Council for an Energy Efficient Economy (which attracts over 350 industry and academic experts); the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy (which attracts over 500 industry and academic experts on energy; the UKERC Sponsored BEHAVE conference in Oxford; Leading a workshop at the Oxford based Environmental Change Institute.\nAs emerging experts in the field of energy and the digital economy members of the research team are now involved in an IEE research project with the National Union of Students. This is engaging a sample of EU Universities and is expected to have the following impact:\n\n\n• 8% average reduction of electricity usage, compared to baseline year, across participating dormitories\n• 4.23GWh electricity-savings (1,902CO2e / 364toe) achieved, compared to baseline year, across participating dormitories, over both academic years\n• 3,773 students (15% of those in dormitories) living in participating dormitories recruited as energy champions each academic year. 7,547 students (30%) engage with the project each academic year\n• Quantifiable behaviour change delivered in students, with 10% swings on target behaviours (e.g. students switching off the lights when not in use) between surveys. 90% of students state they have carried forward the energy-saving habits learnt in the project into private accommodation once they have left dormitories\n• 2.85GWh estimated energy savings (1,284tCO2e/year / 245 toe) from students carrying forward their energy-saving habits into private accommodation\n\nIt is then expected that the project continues to expand on a self-funded basis, reaching 257,805 students in six European countries by Sept 2016 Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Energy,Environment Societal,Economic,Policy & public services","person":"Richard James Bull","coPersons":["Paul David Fleming","Martin William Rieser","Katherine Nesbitt Irvine"],"organisation":"De Montfort University","findingsText":" GoodDee2ds attempted to use digital technologies to facilitate behaviour change through engaging and empowering employees to reduce the environmental impact of public buildings. Almost 20% of the UK’s energy consumption and CO2 emissions arise from non-domestic buildings. Behaviour change initiatives could have a significant impact given current estimates that around 30% of energy in buildings is currently wasted. The aim of the research was to work with Leicester City Council to develop a set of social media/smartphone tools that the local authority can use to reduce the energy demand across its building stock. The purpose was to explore the opportunities for and impact of digital technologies on user-behaviour and energy demand reduction in the non-domestic setting through enabling building users to both understand the environmental impact of their activities and to act in networks \n\nThe project was a success inasmuch as the core objectives of the research were met. A user-group was formed from a group of building-users in Leicester City Council, a web-based app was developed based on the recommendations of the use-group and was launched across the City Council. A full evaluation was carried out of the process via a facilitated focus group process and 10 semi-structured interviews with key actors in both the use-group and in the council. Findings from the first set of focus groups with the user group offer insight into the potential for a more collaborative approach to benefit building users through raising awareness of best practice with regards building energy management. In particular, collaborative approaches have the potential to empower building users with the tools and contacts to resolve issues more quickly. Yet there can be no ‘one-size’ fits all approach to non-domestic buildings with this research highlighting clear variations of engagement and interest in this approach dependent on building type.\n\nFurther analysis from this ‘research in the wild’ into the challenges, opportunities and barriers of attempting a collaborative approach to energy management in an East Midlands local authority shows that whilst encouraging signs exist that participatory processes can improve energy management, there were significant barriers ranging from limited localised control over heating controls to competing organisational priorities meaning energy management fell way down the priority list for most employees. \nIn terms of using innovative digital tools, findings showed that whilst there are positive signs with regards to the potential of increased user-engagement and ICT digital tools to facilitate behaviour change, notable challenges remain with regards to the implementation in ‘real world’ contexts of innovative approaches.\n\nFurther research is needed then to establish to what extent this muted response to digital tools is context specific or actually representative of wider local authorities and other types of organisations. Different digital tools, introduced over a longer period of time with a wider set of users could have led to a very different (more positive response). It is clear that the recruitment of the user-group is vitally important, as is resolving the researcher/ethical dilemma of leading the research from outside the organization. This research was fundamentally about changing the power dynamics of energy management in organisations. Due to the complexities of the organizational culture impact within the organization was limited. Although final reports and research outputs will be fed into the Strategic Partnership meetings and is way too early to determine future impacts. Key strategies are suggested for moving this research agenda forward.\nTwo conference papers have been presented and published at leading EU and American energy research conferences. The ACEEE in particular attracts a non-academic audience. Two journal papers are being written. One has been submitted to a special issues of Indoor and Built Environment and a second will be submitted to Energy Research and Social Science.
