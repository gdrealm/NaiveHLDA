It is an inquiry into the cultures of risk that are found in China. Focus is on financial markets and urban property markets. There is some comparison with Britain. Specific sites of research include the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, property developers in Shanghai, investment banks, one or more major Chinese state owned banks, and one or more large foreign banks operating in China. The comparator is banking/property markets in London’s Canary Wharf. </p> \n<p>The study uses qualitative research methods: interviews and ethnography. Its aim is to produce say, two dozen ‘narratives’ yielding detailed on-the-ground knowledge of these social processes in China. The study’s focus is on ‘producer markets’. It is on how firms on the production-side of a given market construct that market through ‘signalling’ to one another. This signalling may take place through some combination of story-telling, account-giving and decision-justification. The project explores the connections of finance and urban property and of capitalism and communism It does so through, for example, investigating state processes in the sequencing of capital market development; through understanding local state (and local state-owned-enterprise) entrepreneurial activities in urban property markets.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/D001277/1","grantId":"ES/D001277/1","fundValue":"358806","fundStart":"2006-11-01","fundEnd":"2009-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Scott  Lash","coPersons":["Michael  Keith"],"organisation":"Goldsmiths College","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
