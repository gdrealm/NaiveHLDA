Through strategic prioritisation and development of key technology areas we have sought to promote their accelerated adoption, with increased reliability, within a complex global marketplace with increasing cost constraints. Therapies and devices which facilitate the regeneration of body tissues offer the potential to revolutionise healthcare and be a catalyst for economic growth, creating a new business sector within healthcare technology. \n\nThe IKCRTD has built upon the culture and research landscape of the University and its partners (industry, NHS and intermediaries/users) through the development of new innovation infrastructure and practices which deliver major clinical, health and industry outcomes.\nIn the first two years of operation IKCRTD has:\nEstablished a high quality research and innovation platform that is underpinned by:\n &pound;85m new research income\n Established academic supply chain, new research centre with 250 researchers\n University investment for a new Medical Technologies Innovation building to create a community to stimulate innovation.\n\nEmbedded successful sustainable innovation through:\n The development of a robust sustainability model\n Strategic identification and prioritisation of key market sectors\n Contributing to the development of 35 new products that have reached the market\n Developing a culture of innovation across academic, industry and clinical partnerships.\n\nEstablished a significant profile and reputation through:\n Significant political visits and media coverage\n Widened reach and connections across the UK through strategic alignment with Regener8\n Established a Medical Technologies brand to facilitate companies, academics and clinical partners to collaborate with the centre.\n\nEstablished obust innovation management through:\n Recruited and established core team and set up governance structures\n Established an innovation pipeline, stage gates and the criteria for project progression \n A defined IP portfolio, 11 Proof of Concept and 4 Co-Development projects directly funded\n Pipeline of 107 collaborative innovation projects\n Engagement with 34 company partners\n Access to wider network of 200 plus potential collaborative companies.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J017620/1","grantId":"EP/J017620/1","fundValue":"1813540","fundStart":"2012-05-01","fundEnd":"2016-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"
