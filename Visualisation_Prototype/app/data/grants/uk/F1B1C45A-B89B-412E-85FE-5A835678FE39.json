Over the\nnext 10-20 years the global chemistry using industry is predicted to undergo a major transformation. Driven by the need to\ndevelop processes that are both economically and environmentally sustainable, the industry will increasingly turn to\nrenewable feedstocks for the manufacture of a growing range of products. It is estimated that by 2020 approximately 20%\nof existing chemical processes will be based on Industrial Biotechnology (IB), and advanced synthetic biology and\nbioprocesses.\n\nWithin this project we intend to combine several novel technologies, including biopumps, riboswitches, and statistical\nprocess optimization to create engineered micro-organisms which are able to selectively import small molecules, convert\nthem via short synthetic pathways, and export the finished molecules on a whole cell basis. This methodology has the\npotential to revolutionize biocatalysis and IB, and additionally constrains the technical risk, as the use of biopumps allows\nthe optimization of only short synthetic pathways, rather than utilizing an organism's native metabolic pathways from basic\nfeedstocks. The outputs from this grant will lead to alternative sustainable chemical production process, with the potential\nto reduce the reliance on petrochemically derived feedstocks. This research project will also generate technology and\nknowledge that will help maintain the UK's competitive edge, and will produce highly trained and skilled research\npersonnel.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/L004402/1","grantId":"BB/L004402/1","fundValue":"107353","fundStart":"2013-09-19","fundEnd":"2014-12-18","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Neil  Dixon","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":" We have developed new Synthetic Biology tools and technologies with which to better engineering biological hosts ( E.coli cells).
