The major elements of the cytoplasm that must be maintained relatively constant are the ionic composition, simple ions, such as potassium, sodium, chloride, magnesium, iron and protons (pH). In general, a high potassium concentration, low sodium, chloride and proton concentrations are desirable for the normal functioning of enzymes that generate the molecules needed for growth and survival. The cytoplasmic pools of magnesium and iron are maintained constant by complex regulatory networks that will not be considered directly in the current project. When the cell cannot maintain its cytoplasm in the desired state, inhibition of growth occurs and, eventually, bacterial death results. This observation has two immediate consequences. Firstly, many large scale commercial processes for the production of antibiotics and novel therapeutic proteins rely on bacterial growth - understanding how to achieve the best growth is one the major objectives for the pharmaceutical industry. Secondly, the growth of bacteria in the body is normally prevented by the immune system, which can be aided by the use of antibiotics. In food processing and in the environment, bacterial growth should is limited by trying to interfere with the composition of the cytoplasm. New insights arising from the studies proposed here will help us to understand how we can optimise the inhibition and killing of bacterial cells. The project builds upon work in the partner laboratories that have sought to develop an understanding of the mechanisms that regulate potassium accumulation by bacteria, the control over the cytoplasmic pH and the adaptation to high salt conditions. All the partners have achieved excellence in their biological research and in this programme they are now joined by chemists, mathematicians, computer scientists and physicists who will to build models that predict the behaviour of cells. Modelling can describe our current understanding of a biological process and if the accuracy of the model is high, which is dependent on clear communication between the physical scientists and the biologists, the model will predict the outcome of experiments that have not yet been performed. The researchers can then design experiments that test the model and then allow the model to be refined. Ultimate success in this strategy is defioned by being able to predict accurately the outcome of specific experiments and the bacterial response to specific changes in the environment. This information can then be used to try to inform protocols that either improve or reduce bacterial growth and survival.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F003455/1","grantId":"BB/F003455/1","fundValue":"897606","fundStart":"2007-09-01","fundEnd":"2010-11-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Ian Rylance Booth","coPersons":["Celso  Grebogi","Alessandro  De Moura","Samantha  Miller"],"organisation":"University of Aberdeen","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
