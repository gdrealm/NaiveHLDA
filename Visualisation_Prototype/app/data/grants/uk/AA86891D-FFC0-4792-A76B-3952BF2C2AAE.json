A key factor affecting the ability to perform complex everyday life tasks is cognitive executive function. This is because functional tasks involve a complex sequence of motor and cognitive sub-tasks which must be organised, supervised and fluently completed in a specific sequence in order to efficiently achieve the targeted end-state. This study investigates both functional ability and cognitive executive function in healthy elderly people in order to understand how they are related.&nbsp; <br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/G023840/1","grantId":"ES/G023840/1","fundValue":"80305","fundStart":"2009-10-05","fundEnd":"2011-06-04","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Aileen  Ho","coPersons":["Helen Ann Doll"],"organisation":"University of Reading","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
