Her extraordinary legacy of 178 letters offers incomparable insights into London's recusant community, where her activities ranged from comforting the city's Catholic 'ladies who lunch' to nocturnal outings to dig up the body parts of the freshly martyred. As for her earlier life, the vividly detailed memoirs of this self-proclaimed nun reveal how she was subjected to mortification of the flesh, thereby posing uncomfortable questions about childhood abuse and her longing for martyrdom.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=113175/1","grantId":"113175/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2006-04-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Glyn  Redworth","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
