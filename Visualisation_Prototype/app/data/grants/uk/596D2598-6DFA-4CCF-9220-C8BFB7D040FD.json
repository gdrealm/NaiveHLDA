{"id":"596D2598-6DFA-4CCF-9220-C8BFB7D040FD","title":"Realism and Truth: John Wyclif's Literary Theory","abstractText":"Academic research of the past five years has witnessed a growing interest in the neglected relationship between the controversial pronouncements of John Wyclif's mature Latin writings and the abstract, seemingly innocuous claims advanced in his earlier logical and metaphysical works. Historically, scholars have tended to isolate the two, generally privileging the former over the latter (either because of their superficial incompatibility, or because of the comparatively tortuous and sometimes arid flavour of his philosophical investigations). This has had implications not merely for contemporary research into Wyclif's philosophy, but also for work on his theology and political theory, and for new research in the rapidly expanding field of Wycliffite and Lollard studies. The aim of this study will be to present a new account of Wyclif's teaching on scriptural meaning and authority. Though the strong literalism of Wyclif's interpretative method, and its often controversial application by later Wycliffites, has attracted considerable interest within the academy, there has as yet been no comprehensive account of its intricate philosophical foundations. This project will present a detailed reading of Wyclif's exegetical method that will seek to supply this deficiency.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/E005004/1","grantId":"AH/E005004/1","fundValue":"16660","fundStart":"2007-03-01","fundEnd":"2007-05-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Stephen  Penn","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Stirling","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
