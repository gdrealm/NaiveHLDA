{"id":"A53E786C-23CB-4480-8D2D-5B204E16C164","title":"Development of statistical methods for the analysis of single patient data","abstractText":"Questions arise where an individual is to be compared with a population. What proportion of patients suffering from this disease would have a temperature as low as this patient? Is this patient's combination of enzyme levels unusual? Is it rare to have a pulse rate this high with a blood pressure reading this low? This type of comparison can be of interest, not only to the patient and those treating the patient, but also to science. For example, a patient with a brain injury may display a strange combination of abilities that give insight into the architecture of the brain: the patient may be better than most people at performing one task but much worse than most people at a second task, even though the two tasks are apparently similar. This would show that while the two tasks seem similar they are, in fact, performed by different parts of the brain as the brain injury has impaired performance on one task but not the other. As another example, a patient with Alzheimer's disease might appear to have a reduced rate of memory loss for certain tasks after starting a new medication for a different complaint. Then it is important to know whether the patient's results are genuinely unusual for a person with Alzheimer's disease. \n\nStatistical methods are needed to answer these types of question. Good methods have been developed for the simplest situations where only a single attribute is of interest. These methods are well-used by neuropsychologists and neuroscientists. However, better methods are still needed for situations where an individual appears to have an unusual combination of attributes involving several different tasks. Also, when there are three or more tasks the current methods cannot make adjustments to reflect personal characteristics, such as age or gender. The purpose of this project is to develop statistically valid methods for some of these more complex situations. The challenge is to devise methods that are accurate when information is available for just a small sample of people from the population with whom the individual is to be compared.\n\nThere are two fundamentally different approaches to statistics, the frequentist approach and the Bayesian approach. The Bayesian approach is easier to implement for the problems addressed in this project but the frequentist approach has some desirable properties. The aim is to develop Bayesian and Bayesian-based methods that have some of the good properties that frequentist methods give. Methods will be implemented in user-friendly software that is freely available and can be run over the web without down-loading it to one's computer, though the latter will be an option.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/J013838/1","grantId":"MR/J013838/1","fundValue":"383929","fundStart":"2012-11-05","fundEnd":"2015-11-04","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Paul  Garthwaite","coPersons":["Michael Christopher Jones","John  Crawford"],"organisation":"Open University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
