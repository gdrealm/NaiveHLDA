These record what was the most important branch of Ireland’s overseas trade in minute detail. Customs accounts covering nine individual years, spaced across the sixteenth century, will be inputted into a computer database and analysed by the researchers. This data is invaluable because poor record survival mean that no other economic records of equivalent value survive in Ireland, or elsewhere.&nbsp; The Bristol customs accounts thus constitute the best quantitative source that exists for examining Ireland’s economic development over the course of the sixteenth century.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-23-1461","grantId":"RES-000-23-1461","fundValue":"143867","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2008-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Evan Thomas Jones","coPersons":["Brendan  Smith","R  Gillespie"],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
