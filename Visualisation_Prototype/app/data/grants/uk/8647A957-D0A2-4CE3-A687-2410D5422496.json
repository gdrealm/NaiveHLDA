{"id":"8647A957-D0A2-4CE3-A687-2410D5422496","title":"p-adic Iwasawa theory for Galois representations","abstractText":"Iwasawa theory is a subfield of number theory whose fundamental questions relate arithmetic problems (e.g. rational solutions to polynomial equations in several variables) to analytic information (e.g. values of certain complex-analytic functions, so-called L-functions). The merging of these two disparate ideas makes Iwasawa theory a mysterious and powerful field. Via its main conjectures, Iwasawa theory remains the only systematic method known today for studying the deep connections between the arithmetic problems and special values of L-functions, typified by the conjecture of Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer. \n\nOne can use Iwasawa theory to study the arithmetic of elliptic curves, which are a class of polynomial equations in two variables. Questions about the arithmetic of elliptic curves are linked to some of the oldest problems in number theory, such as the congruent number problem which concerns the existence of right-angled triangles with certain properties. Elliptic curves also played a central role in Wiles' proof of Fermat's last theorem. \n\nIn the proposed research I plan to investigate some aspects of the Iwasawa theory of elliptic curves using recently developed tools from an another area of mathematics called 'p-adic analysis'. This should give new insight into some important problems (such as the Birch--Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture) in algebraic number theory.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J018716/1","grantId":"EP/J018716/1","fundValue":"90155","fundStart":"2012-09-01","fundEnd":"2014-08-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  As this grant has only just finished, it is too early to make definitive statements about the impact of the research that was carried out during the period of the grant.
