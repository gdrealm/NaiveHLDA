For the individual, the illness can disrupt a broad range of mental functions, leading to a variety of symptoms including hearing voices, suffering from unusual and pervasive beliefs which affect everyday functioning and social interaction, and problems with basic mental skills, such as memory, language and problem solving. For society, the illness represents a major social and financial cost. The treatments currently available for the disease are often only partially effective, since we know relatively little about the disturbances in the brain that lead to the symptoms of schizophrenia. \n\nIt is therefore important to learn more about the disruptions of the function of the brain in order that more effective treatments can be developed. The extent to which the symptoms of schizophrenia can be mimicked in animals is limited, since the illness involves a disorder of functions which can be considered uniquely human. An effective strategy to investigate brain disorder in schizophrenia is to reproduce the symptoms of the illness in healthy subjects using drugs which produce similar types of experiences. This can be done extremely safely in a controlled research environment, and our research team has substantial expertise in this field. \n\nThe development of new brain imaging techniques in the last decade has allowed scientists to examine the living human brain, as it orchestrates human thoughts and actions. In order to examine the effects that these drugs have on the brain, and how they produce schizophrenia-like experiences, we therefore propose to use these brain scanning techniques to observe the effects of the drugs in healthy subjects, and compare this with the abnormalities we see in patients with schizophrenia. \n\nThe main objective of this project is to test whether a particular brain pathway that is thought to be important in schizophrenia is also disrupted by the drugs which reproduce some of the symptoms of the illness in healthy subjects. We aim to compare the effects of 2 drugs which both produce schizophrenia-like symptoms, but by different effects on the brain, and thereby hope to isolate the core common mechanisms. This would represent an important step in identifying the principal targets for treatment. \n\nThe findings of this study will be made available to the public via the annual Cambridge Science Festival hosted by the University.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0501226","grantId":"G0501226","fundValue":"325023","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Garry  Honey","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
