It is caused by persistent bacterial infection (biofilm) that is impossible to cure with traditional antibiotic treatment, but can be resolved with a prolonged course of high dose antibiotics given directly to the affected area. The current treatment of severe persistent glue ear consists of grommet (ventilation tube) insertion, but although this is the commonest surgical procedure in children, it only removes the glue fluid and does not address the underlying problem of bacterial biofilm infection. Therefore, a quarter of children require further grommet insertion within 2 years of initial surgery, and management of glue ear and its long-term complications presents a significant problem and workload to the clinician.\nWe plan to investigate a novel alternative strategy for glue ear treatment, by developing a slow-release antibiotic implant that can be inserted into the middle ear to release antibiotics at a high dose over a prolonged period of time to eradicate infection. This project in a laboratory setting will develop the slow-release antibiotic implant and test its effectiveness against bacterial biofilm infection.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0902230","grantId":"G0902230","fundValue":"116325","fundStart":"2010-04-20","fundEnd":"2011-04-19","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Matija  Daniel","coPersons":["Heather  Fortnum","Roger  Bayston","Kevin  Shakesheff","John P  Birchall"],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
