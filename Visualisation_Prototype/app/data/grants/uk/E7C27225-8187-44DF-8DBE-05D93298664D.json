It is noted that demolition waste comprises significant proportion of valuable building materials that could be re-used\nfor new constructions or refurbishment if recovered properly. However, no such tool currently exists that can help in\nidentification of valuable building materials for reuse &amp; recycling. The overall aim of this project is to develop an\nintelligence-based tool called Deconstruction and Recovery Information Modelling (DRIM) that will enable identification of\nreusable and recoverable building materials at end-of-life of a building. DRIM Tool will enable: (i) production of\ndeconstruction plan; (ii) simulation of deconstruction process; (iii) production of deconstruction protocols during demolition\nof the building to enable efficient recovery; (iv) improved demolition waste collection schemes. The tool is aimed at both\nnew and existing buildings sector. The Tool will use innovative technologies that include ontologies, NoSQL and big data\nanalytics to capture and predict end-of-life properties and value of building materials. It is about circular economy in the\nconstruction industry.\n\nMethodology and Plan: This is a 24 Months (M) project of 8 Work Packages (WP): (i) WP1 - Data collection on Materials\nproperties using workshops with Designers and Suppliers - Month 1 - 6 (6M); (ii) WP2 - Creation of Semantic Store with\nEnd-of-Life Material Properties - Month 4 - 9 (6M); (iii) WP3 - Creation of Big Data Analytics Simulation Platform - Month 7 -\n12 (6M); (iv) WP4 -Prototype DRIM Development - Month 9 - 12 (4M); (v) WP5 - Full DRIM Development - Month 13 - 21\n(9M); (vi) WP6 - Security &amp; Testing of DRIM tool - Month 22 - 23 (2M); (vii) WP7 - Exploitation and Dissemination - Month 4\n- 24 (21M); and (viii) WP8 - Project Management - Month 1 - 24 (24M). - (Please see Appendix B for Gantt Chart).\nKey Milestones, Deliverables &amp; Realistic Timelines: WP1 - Gigantic Dataset of Material Properties @ M6; WP2 - Database\nstorage of End-of-Life Material Properties @ M9; WP3 - Big Data Analytics based Simulation Platform @ M12; WP4 -\nDRIM Prototype @ M12; WP5 - DRIM Full System @ M21; WP6 - Packaged DRIM Tool @M23; WP7 - Exploitable &amp;\nDissemination Outputs @ M4 to M24; and WP8 - Quarterly Project Reports &amp; Meetings.\nClear Management Reporting Lines: Lara Ayris from Waste Plan Solutions Ltd. (WPS) will project manage and coordinate\nproject resources, with the support of Project Administrator and Exploitation Manager for wider roll-out. Project\nManagement Board (PMB) will be set to drive project, monitor project progress and provide relevant advice. Using\nPRINCE2 methodology, Task managers for each WP will (i) manage day-to-day project activities (ii) meet with their WP\nteam on weekly basis (iii) meet monthly (iv) report quarterly to the PMB about work progress . - (Please see Appendix B for\nProject Management Structure).\nRival Solutions: None of the existing waste tools within the industry (i.e. ArchiCAD, Revit, SMARTWaste, WRAP Netwaste,\netc.) has deconstruction and material recovery functionality. The DRIM tool is therefore unique within the industry. It will\nprovide a simulation platform to benchmark the whole-life sustainability of designs in terms end-of-life re-usable, recyclable\nand recovered materials.\nAlternative R&amp;D Strategies: Concurrent Engineering (CE) model which is based on parellelization of tasks (Work\nPackages) will be used as a R&amp;D approach for this project, as compared to traditional waterfall model where tasks are\ncarried out sequentially. CE will therefore enable R&amp;D completion within 2 years of project duration.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/N509012/1","grantId":"EP/N509012/1","fundValue":"218964","fundStart":"2016-04-01","fundEnd":"2018-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Lukumon Oladayo Oyedele","coPersons":["Vikas  Kumar","Ximing  Ruan","Ismail  Adelopo","Bolanle  Karimu"],"organisation":"University of the West of England","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
