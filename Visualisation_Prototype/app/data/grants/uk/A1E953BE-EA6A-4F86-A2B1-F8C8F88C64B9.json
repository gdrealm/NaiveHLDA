The preoccupied attachment style is associated with hypervigilance towards emotional stimuli. Fearful-avoidant style is associated with the orienting of processing resources away from emotional stimuli. Dismissing-avoidant style is (historically) associated with orienting away from emotional stimuli, resulting in poor encoding and recollection of attachment-relevant events. </p>\n\n<p>Two recent studies however, report that dismissing-avoidant style is associated with a bias towards processing emotional information, in much the same way as the preoccupied style. On the basis of these findings it has been suggested that dismissing-avoidant individuals automatically orient towards the processing of emotionally-laden information when they encounter it (Stage 1) in order that they may then more efficiently avoid it (Stage 2). The current research tests this two-stage hypothesis. </p>\n\n<p>We examine whether sensitivity to perceptual cues of emotion differs across attachment styles by use of computer morphing techniques that vary the intensity of emotional expression in faces. We further examine whether attentional strategies used to process emotional stimuli vary with attachment style. Covert shifts of attention (with no eye movement) towards or away from emotional information will be examined using attentional and eye movement tasks.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-0052","grantId":"RES-062-23-0052","fundValue":"303676","fundStart":"2006-09-01","fundEnd":"2009-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Angela Christine Rowe","coPersons":["Ian Scott Penton-Voak","Casimir  Ludwig"],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
