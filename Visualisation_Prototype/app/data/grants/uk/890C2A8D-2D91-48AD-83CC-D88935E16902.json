Limited battery life and excessive internal power densities limit the number of transistors that can be active simultaneous in a silicon chip. Energy and power reduction in conventional computing is limited by the inability of modifying the architecture or adapting to changes in the fabrication process, temperature or application requirements after chip fabrication. When these changes are possible are limited by the need of &quot;margining&quot; that introduces safety margins so devices operate under worst conditions. Worst conditions are rarely the case an important energy and performance gains are possible if technology can adapt to the real conditions of operation. This research addresses this challenge by investigating energy proportional computing with a novel voltage, frequency and logic scaling triplet to adapt to changes in applications, fabrication or operating conditions. The results from this research are expected to deliver new fundamental insights to the question of: How future computers can obtain orders of magnitude higher performance with limited energy budgets?","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/L00321X/1","grantId":"EP/L00321X/1","fundValue":"392717","fundStart":"2013-11-01","fundEnd":"2017-04-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The project is still on-going but for example the systems is being prototype in a portable application that needs to operate at a low energy point.

Initial results have demonstrated energy and power savings closed to one order of magnitude. There is the opportunity of exploiting the technology commercially in high performance computing areas such as finance modelling and signal processing. This is currently being explored. A number of companies are funding the development of prototypes to evaluate the application of this technology to some of their problems. These are partially funded by TSB and the companies themselves. Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Electronics,Energy,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy","dataset":"gtr"}
