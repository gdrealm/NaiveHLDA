Zamiatin trained as a naval architect and was in Britain building icebreakers during WWl; thereafter he stayed true to his 'second wife', literature and he came to occupy a central position in Soviet intellectual life of the 1920s. However, his works were banned, and he was lucky to be allowed to emigrate in 1931; he died in Paris in 1937. Until the sensational first publication of We In glasnost' Russia in 1988, his name was scarcely mentioned in Russian scholarship. \nI am writing a new study of Zamiatin, based on work in ten archives in Russia, Europe and the USA, which will incorporate over a thousand unpublished archival documents about him that have become available in the post-Soviet period. There has been no biography of Zamiatin in English since 1968, and my monograph will be of interest to readers of twentieth-century English as well as Russian literature, i am hoping that the book will also be translated into Russian, since to this day there have been no biographies of this banned writer in his own homeland.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=113131/1","grantId":"113131/1","fundValue":"10510","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2006-03-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Julie  Curtis","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
