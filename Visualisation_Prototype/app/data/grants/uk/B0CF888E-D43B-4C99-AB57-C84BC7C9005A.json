The project will use live performance, voice-synthesizing programmes and projected sound and images to examine the phenomenon of the technological uncanny, investigating cultural anxieties about mechanisation in modernity, and in particular cultural representations of the mechanically disembodied voice from the nineteenth century to the present. The project is part of collaboration between the Centre for Research in Opera and Music Theatre at the University of Sussex and three European research centres.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=119358/1","grantId":"119358/1","fundValue":"24973","fundStart":"2006-03-01","fundEnd":"2006-12-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Nicholas  Till","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sussex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
