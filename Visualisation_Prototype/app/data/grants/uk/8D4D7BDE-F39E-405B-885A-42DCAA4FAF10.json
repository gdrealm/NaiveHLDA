Reproductive failure in cattle is one area of great concern to the agricultural sector, as it has a major impact on productivity in UK cattle herds. While there are many factors contributing to reduced rates of reproduction in livestock systems, infection plays a key role, with 77% of diagnosed cases of bovine fetal death reported as resulting from infectious causes. However, diagnosis of the infectious causes of pre-natal death in cattle is poor, with 80% of cases remaining undiagnosed (according to DEFRA's Veterinary Investigation Surveillance reports for 2002-09). This can be explained in part by a failure to detect the presence of other unidentified disease causing organisms.\n\nIn recent years, there has been an increase in the identification of a group of new emerging bacterial organisms that are found in the environment and have been shown to be associated with a variety of conditions in humans, such as pneumonia and miscarriage. These organisms, which share similar biological characteristics to Chlamydia species that are known to cause a broad range of infections in humans and animals, such as sexually-transmitted infections, pneumonia, blindness and fetal death, are referred to as Chlamydia-like organisms. These Chlamydia-like organisms are also increasingly becoming recognized as potential disease causing organisms of livestock, being particularly associated with the pre-natal death of calves. Indeed, they have been found in over a quarter of the cases analyzed in the UK, and thus could account for some of the 80% unaccounted, undiagnosed cases reported by DEFRA.\n\nTo date, the only studies that have been carried out have relied upon the analysis of tissue samples, which have been submitted to veterinary laboratories for disease diagnosis. While these studies have been vital in demonstrating the presence of the organisms in samples for which no alternative diagnoses could be reached, they have been performed on a relatively small number of samples. In addition, in general, little information is obtained on the disease and production histories of the farms from which the animals originated. Thus, this study aims to investigate the presence of these organisms on dairy farms across the UK and how this relates to animal production performance. We will isolate the organisms from clinical samples to allow us to characterise and assess how many different types of Chlamydia-like organisms are present in the UK cattle herds, as well as investigate their potential spread from animal to animal by analyzing environmental samples, such as drinking water and bedding. We will also develop experimental model systems to allow us to investigate how the organisms cause infection and disease, and determine the immune response to infection.\n\nThe combination of these studies will greatly increase our understanding of the disease causing potential and role of this group of emerging bacteria in cattle reproduction. The outcomes will lead to improved diagnoses of cattle reproductive failure, inform and educate the industry to the presence of these organisms, lead to improved management systems and allow an evaluation of the potential benefits of future vaccine strategies to prevent disease incidence.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/J015601/1","grantId":"BB/J015601/1","fundValue":"182475","fundStart":"2013-03-22","fundEnd":"2016-09-20","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The project is at the stage of data collection and testing of biological samples; databases are still being created.  ","person":"Javier  Guitian","coPersons":["Dirk  Pfeiffer"],"organisation":"Royal Veterinary College","findingsText":" With regard to the initial components of the project, data on herd management, health and production has been obtained by means of questionnaires from 219 dairy farms across GB. A database has been established and data captured are currently being introduced in the database. From each of the 219 farms, a bulk milk tank sample has been collected and is currently being tested by our partners at Moredun Research Institute (MRI) and at the National Milk laboratories. The first component of the project is therefore pending laboratory results but all the field data and specimen collection has been completed. \nAs for subsequent phases of the project, we have successfully engaged a number of veterinarians who have just started to obtain abortion materials and vaginal swabs from selected dairy herds. Testing of these samples for reproductive pathogens and Chlamydia-like organisms (CLO) will be conducted at MRI and, based on the results; a number of farms positive for CLO will be recruited to take part in the planned cohort study. Field and laboratory work is ongoing; once completed, we will calculate national-level prevalence and identify risk factors for the presence of reproductive pathogens and Chlamydia-like organisms in GB dairy herds. This information can be used to inform control policies for these pathogens at the national and individual herd level. More targeted and cost-effective control of these pathogens can minimize their impact on reproductive efficiency of dairy herds and as a result contribute to the financial sustainability of dairy farms and mitigate their environmental impact. The translation of research outputs into tangible impact will be facilitated by the involvement of DairyCo, the levy-funded, not-for-profit organisation working on behalf of Britain's dairy farmers, who are actively involved in this project, which overlaps with ongoing research they are currently funding. Through this involvement it will be possible for our results to reach individual farmers and veterinarians who may use them to make decisions on more cost-effective control of infectious diseases in British dairy herds.
