{"id":"57ECDC0B-DED2-4B2A-B743-A7BC3FC48B42","title":"Sub-Cellular OCT Imaging","abstractText":"Optical coherence tomography (OCT) allows the 3D imaging of skin tissue on a depth scale of ~1-2mm with resolution ~10um. It has been described as an optical analog of ultrasound imaging and offers significantly better resolution than MRI and ultrasound. It has already gained clinical acceptance in ophthalmology and is emerging into other fields such as oncology, monitoring wound healing, cardiology, and guided surgery. The advantages of OCT include:- \n\nVideo rate images of sub-surface morphology at resolutions ~100 better than ultrasound and voxel rates ~1000 higher than microscopy. \nLabel-free imaging of the sample (in vivo or in vitro).\nNon-ionizing radiation. \nNon-contact\nEndoscopic\n\nOCT is ideal for imaging 1~2mm below the surface in biological tissue. Our project is concerned with the development of a prototype swept laser source with 200 - 300 nm sweep range providing sub cellular resolution. We will develop the laser system and trial it in an OCT imagining system.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/J021571/1","grantId":"BB/J021571/1","fundValue":"125816","fundStart":"2012-06-01","fundEnd":"2013-05-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Richard Andrew Hogg","coPersons":["Stephen  Matcher","David  Childs"],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
