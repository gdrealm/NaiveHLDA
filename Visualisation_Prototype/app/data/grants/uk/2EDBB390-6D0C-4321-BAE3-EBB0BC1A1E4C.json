In the developing world, where 85% of people with HIV live, the life expectancy and economic potential of many countries is being substantially reduced by AIDS. In spite of the successful development of effective antiviral therapy in the 1990s, the epidemic continues to grow beyond our capacity to counter it. While much of the solution to this problem arguably lies in the spheres of public health and international politics, a sustainable and sufficient approach will inevitably require the development of new classes of drug and effective vaccines. A key target for antiviral immune responses and also for potential antivirals is the molecular process of cellular attachment and penetration by HIV-1 virions. We have developed a set of reagents and techniques around anti-viral aptamers which we believe form the basis for powerfully investigating this target in the virus life cycle. This proposal aims to exploit aptamers not only to satisfy our scientific curiosity about the biology of HIV but provide realistic leads into vaccine and drug development.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0401610","grantId":"G0401610","fundValue":"230000","fundStart":"2005-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-01-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"William Siward James","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
