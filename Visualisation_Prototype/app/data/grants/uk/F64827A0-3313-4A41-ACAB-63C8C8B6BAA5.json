There is a unique opportunity to bring together three\nparticipants, each of whom are in possession of an essential\ncomponent, to implement and widely disseminate a novel software tool.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J01298X/1","grantId":"EP/J01298X/1","fundValue":"6800","fundStart":"2011-10-01","fundEnd":"2012-06-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Gabor  Csanyi","coPersons":["Benedict  Leimkuhler"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
