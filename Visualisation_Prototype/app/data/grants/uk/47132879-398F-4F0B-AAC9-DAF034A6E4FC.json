The polymeric products obtained through the use of such mediators will be exploited in partnership with industries in a variety of commercial applications, from bulk polymer production to healthcare and personal care products.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E502733/1","grantId":"EP/E502733/1","fundValue":"67792","fundStart":"2007-01-08","fundEnd":"2008-01-07","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Sebastien  Perrier","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
