It defines leadership in a new way, as occurring when one firm makes a change in price that is followed precisely by the other within a short predefined period of time. This is then tested for a major case, the two leading players in the UK supermarket industry, with simultaneous pricing as the alternative. Thus we are the first to provide a precise characterisation of price leadership in this industry.\n\n\n\nWe have also shown an unusual but important composition issue in supermarket pricing practices that has not previously been revealed. This is that regularly more prices go down than go up, whilst &quot;basket&quot; prices rise. It happens because price falls are much smaller in magnitude than price rises, something not previously noted but characteristic of British supermarkets. This has impact on macroeconomic phenomena. Our contributions in this area are empirical.\n\n\n\nMacroeconomists have become very interested in micro price movements: A key question examined in major papers is whether prices are &quot;flexible&quot; at micro level. We make a significant contribution to this debate, by providing evidence from Britain of significant flexibility at individual product level that has wider ramifications. Our evidence, based on data that one journal referee has described as &quot;very exciting&quot; is based on actual prices, rather than prices inferred from scanner data, and covers a long period including what has become known as the Great Recession, so clearly of interest to macroeconomists. Thus our evidence is of relative flexibility during different macroeconomic circumstances, where we show the data exhibits higher flexibility in more inflationary times.  ","dataset":"gtr"}
