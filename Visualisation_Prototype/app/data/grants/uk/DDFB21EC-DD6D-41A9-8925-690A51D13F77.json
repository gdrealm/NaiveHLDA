In Phase 1, a steering group of interested stakeholders are formed and approximately 25 secondary schools across the north-west of England will be sampled to secure participants for later phases. In Phase 2, profiles of inclusion are developed and compared for 30 pupils with ASDs, 30 pupils with dyslexia, and 30 pupils without special educational needs. These profiles will be developed through the collection of data at individual (eg attainment), peer-group (eg social acceptance), institutional (eg teacher attitudes) and other (eg parental attitudes) levels. Analysis of these profiles lead to the selection of 4 exemplar ‘good practice’ schools for Phase 3. This phase involves in-depth case-studies of each exemplar school through interviews (eg pupils, parents, teachers), observations (lessons and other contexts) and document analysis (eg individual education plans). In Phase 4 the findings of the project are disseminated to relevant audiences (eg parents, pupils, schools, academics, policy-makers) through a series of events (eg regional seminars) and outputs (eg papers in academic journals and support group newsletters).</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F000731/1","grantId":"ES/F000731/1","fundValue":"294840","fundStart":"2008-02-29","fundEnd":"2011-02-28","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Neil  Humphrey","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
