Once these cells are destroyed, patients need to inject insulin in order to take up glucose. Manual glucose monitoring and insulin injection cannot balance blood glucose levels as well as endogenous production, and complications arising from poor glucose control are common. The aim of our research is to discover a cure for this disease.\n\nAs T1D is mediated by the immune system, and many of the processes involved are too complex to be replicated in an in vitro system, a lot of our work therefore requires use of experimental mice. As disease progression is not uniform even in the T1D prone non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse strain, large groups of mice need to be assessed to determine if a treatment reduces immune infiltration in the islets, or if it changes the proportions of different types of immune cells. As the pancreas is situated within the abdominal cavity the mice have to be culled to access it, meaning that for every time point studied a fresh group of mice has to be used. \n\nOur proposal describes the use of a completely novel method for investigating immune infiltration into islets transplanted into the pinna of the ear. This method allows non-invasive and repeated investigation of the same islets at different time points. The fact that the same individual can be measured before and after any treatment removes the need for large group sizes, and as the imaging is non invasive the same individual can be measured at several time points, reducing the number of groups needed. We believe that this novel technique will allow us to collect better quality data using significantly fewer experimental animals.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NC/M001083/1","grantId":"NC/M001083/1","fundValue":"368635","fundStart":"2014-09-01","fundEnd":"2017-08-31","funder":"NC3Rs","impactText":"","person":"Maja  Wallberg","coPersons":["Anne  Cooke"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
