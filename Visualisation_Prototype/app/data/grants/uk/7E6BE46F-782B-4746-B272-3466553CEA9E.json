QALYs combine changes in life expectancy and in health status by weighting the time patients spend in different health states using weights which reflect how bad the health state is relative to full health. While there are several measures to estimate QALYs in adults, relatively little has been done to develop QALYs for children. Developing child-specific outcome measures is difficult because it is necessary to take into account children's cognitive ability at various ages. In addition there are some health domains, which may be less applicable below a certain age, and little reason why children should attach the same relative importance to different aspects of their health as do adults. Only a few attempts have been made to develop reliable QALYs measures for children. The Child Health Utility 9D (CHU9D) is a paediatric preference based measure designed specifically for children aged 7-11. Instead of using literature and experts' opinion the CHU9D was based on one-to-one interviews conducted with children. Despite being a reliable and effective QALY measure CHU9D presents three main limitations: being designed for self-completion it requires children to be able to read and therefore it cannot routinely be administered to children younger than 7 years without the assistance of an adult. Second: the preference weights for the CHU9D were estimated using a Standard Gamble technique from a sample of UK adults and not from children. Third: especially for severely ill children reading and completing a written questionnaire can be tiring and sometimes impossible. \n\nStarting from the descriptive system developed for the existing CHU9D this research will investigate if an animated speaking character provides a better means of asking children about their current health than a hard copy self-completed questionnaire. If it is the case that animation provides a better means of asking children about their health, then this research study will open up an opportunity to obtain health status measurements and preference information from children so that the child-based descriptions of health would no longer have to be valued using adult preferences.\n\nCurrently many thousands of children live with chronic illnesses in the UK. Examples include congenital heart disease, which affects 8 to 9 per 1000 live births with the majority of children surviving to adulthood; the commonest inherited condition cystic fibrosis, which affects 1 in 2500 live births resulting in a current total of 9000 children and young adults living with the condition; and childhood cancers which affect 1500 new children each year with around 75% surviving long term. Children experience acute illnesses and injuries: 3.5 million children attend accident and emergency departments per year, with 25% of them representing serious health problems, and 390 thousand children are admitted to hospital in relation to a surgical procedure per year a proportion of which represent major specilialist surgeries. \nObtaining self reported health state information from children in particular those with life long health conditions or serious illnesses that require burdensome treatments is fundamental in order to understand the differences between proposed clinical interventions. Currently children undergo health care interventions, including participation in clinical trials, with benefits being measured in the absence of information obtained from them about the related effects on their quality of life. Successful development of a child friendly method for evaluation of health states and preferences directly from children themselves would add considerably to our ability to measure outcomes and evaluate the effectiveness of treatments for children.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/K00624X/1","grantId":"MR/K00624X/1","fundValue":"323300","fundStart":"2012-11-01","fundEnd":"2015-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"John  Cairns","coPersons":["Joan  Ashworth","Katherine Louise  Brown","Jo  Wray"],"organisation":"London Sch of Hygiene and Trop Medicine","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
