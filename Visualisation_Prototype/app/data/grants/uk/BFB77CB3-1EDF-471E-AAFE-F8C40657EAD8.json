{"id":"BFB77CB3-1EDF-471E-AAFE-F8C40657EAD8","title":"Research partnership to assess the burden and aetiology of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA)","abstractText":"The research proposal brings together a series of independent research programmes to study non-communicable diseases (NCDs), including the impact of chronic infection-HIV and hepatitis viruses-on these diseases, across sub-Saharan Africa. With opportunities for research capacity strengthening and training, the partnership provides a unique research framework to design and conduct large scale studies that will provide more reliable and precise information on disease burden and underlying causes of these diseases. The partnership also provides a platform to increase critical mass and help foster research leadership at the institutions within the partnership. Importantly, the proposal brings together institutes with established and nascent research programmes aimed at studying NCDs at the population-level. The overall aim is to develop a sustainable partnership that will facilitate multi-centre research to assess the burden and aetiology of NCDs in SSA to improve the evidence base underpinning potential responses to NCDs, provide a platform for interventional research in NCDs, and to ensure that African populations benefit from the ongoing advances in genomics.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/K013491/1","grantId":"MR/K013491/1","fundValue":"901136","fundStart":"2013-06-30","fundEnd":"2018-06-29","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Manjinder  Sandhu","coPersons":["Nicholas John Wareham","Andrew  Prentice","Naomi Dinky Levitt","Clement Adebayo  Adebamowo","Kaushik  Ramaiya","Stephen Meir Tollman","Albert George Baidoe  Amoah","Charles N.
