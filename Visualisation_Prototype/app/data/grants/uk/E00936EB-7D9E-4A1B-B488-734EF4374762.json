This is how most medicines work and much of the early stage research in the pharmaceutical industry focuses on identifying and optimising small molecules to be tested as drugs. Over the past ten years, there has also been an increase in what is known as chemical biology research, where the action of such small molecules is used as a tool in fundamental research to understand how biological processes work. However, it is extremely difficult to find a small molecule with exactly the right shape and properties to bind strongly and specifically to a particular macromolecule. One new technique that has been developed recently is the method of fragment-based discovery. Instead of having to find the complete molecule that fits the binding site, this approach begins by identifying smaller pieces of molecule that bind. If the way in which these small fragments can be understood, then the chemist can design changes that merge or grow these fragments into the larger compound with the correct properties.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/G024537/1","grantId":"BB/G024537/1","fundValue":"112878","fundStart":"2009-08-17","fundEnd":"2010-11-16","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Roderick Eliot  Hubbard","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of York","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
