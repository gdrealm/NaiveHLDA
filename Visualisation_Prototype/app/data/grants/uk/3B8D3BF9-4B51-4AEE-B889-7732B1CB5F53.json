{"id":"3B8D3BF9-4B51-4AEE-B889-7732B1CB5F53","title":"The aetiology of psychosis high-risk mental states during adolescence in the ALSPAC cohort","abstractText":"The presence of psychotic symptoms such as delusions and hallucinations, along with impaired functioning is likely to present a high-risk mental state for development of clinically important psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia, and indeed such individuals are amongst the targets for early intervention services. Our broad aim is to understand more about how these high-risk mental states for psychosis arise during adolescence in order to inform future preventive interventions. \n\nOur first two aims are to describe the extent of these high risk mental states and their relationship with earlier mental health problems, such as depression, anxiety, conduct problems as well as earlier psychotic symptoms. We will then look at two areas that appear to be very important for the aetiology of psychosis. The first of these is the consistent association found between people who have lower IQ scores and the development of psychosis. The second is the relationship between cannabis use and the later development of these high risk mental states. There is extensive and repeated data available on these matters in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) and the study will be able to exploit the previously collected data in order to answer these questions.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0701503","grantId":"G0701503","fundValue":"886589","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2013-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Glyn  Lewis","coPersons":["Shon William Lewis","Timothy James  Peters","George  DaveySmith","Anthony  David","Stanley  Zammit","Jon  Heron","Glynn  Harrison","Dieter  Wolke","Mary  Cannon","David John Gunnell","Peter Brian Jones"],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
