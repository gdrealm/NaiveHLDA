{"id":"B677C7C8-03AF-40E6-A84A-36BC66E6BD52","title":"Carbon reduction options for Housing managers - Real Time","abstractText":"This project will develop, test and verify a new energy model: Carbon Reduction Options for Housing Managers (CROHM RT). CROHM RT will be able to combine conventional energy survey data with high frequency energy monitoring data and detailed tenant energy usage and appliance data. This will enable significantly more powerful automated analysis and scenario modelling than is currently possible. \n\nAt present CROHM provides strategic energy installation guidance based on modelling of energy data across a portfolio; EnergyDeck collates and presents real time monitoring data. CROHM RT will enable a significant enhancement by enabling the combination of these existing services in creative ways, for example: quantification of comfort factors based on monitored data; incorporation of meter readings and tenant appliance and behaviour profiles to identify and support opportunities for behaviour change, predicting the actual effect of energy efficiency measures in actual situations.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M506746/1","grantId":"EP/M506746/1","fundValue":"48318","fundStart":"2014-06-01","fundEnd":"2016-05-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Nick  Eyre","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
