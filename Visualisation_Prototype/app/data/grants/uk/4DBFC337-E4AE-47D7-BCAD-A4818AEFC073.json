{"id":"4DBFC337-E4AE-47D7-BCAD-A4818AEFC073","title":"Employee Engagement, Organisational Performance and Individual Wellbeing: Exploring the Evidence, Developing the Theory","abstractText":"<p>The focus of this seminar series is employee engagement, and the links between engagement, individual wellbeing and organisational performance. Interest in the topic of employee engagement has arisen as part of the wider growth of positive organisational psychology. Engagement is commonly viewed as a set of positive work-related attitudes, feelings and behaviours. There has been substantial interest in the topic of engagement on the part of practitioners, particularly in the wake of the UK government's 2009 MacLeod Review highlighting the benefits of an engaged workforce. </p>\n\n<p>The aim of this series is to bring together academics, policymakers and practitioners to debate and discuss employee engagement, to bolster the UK research base on the topic, and to disseminate academic research on engagement to a wide audience. </p>\n\n<p>The series comprises four seminars, starting on 8 February 2011 at Kent University. A special issue of the International Journal of Human Resource Management is linked with the series. The ethos of the series is inclusive, and each seminar will comprise presentations from experienced and early career academics as well as leading practitioners and policymakers, allowing plenty of time for debate and discussion. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-451-26-0807","grantId":"RES-451-26-0807","fundValue":"15109","fundStart":"2011-02-01","fundEnd":"2013-01-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Katie  Truss","coPersons":["Georgy  Petrov","Amanda  Shantz","Rick  Delbridge","Emma Charlotte Soane","Kerstin  Alfes"],"organisation":"University of Kent","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
