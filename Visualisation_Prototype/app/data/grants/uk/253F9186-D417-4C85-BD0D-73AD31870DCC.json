Firstly, existing surveys of fertility ideals and intentions will be subjected to in-depth statistical analysis in order to identify some of the key determinants of small family ideation and outcome. Secondly, these determinants will be explored in greater depth in a pilot qualitative study in the two regions.</p>\n\n<p>The project attempts to examine whether or not small families have become ‘normalised’ and judge the extent to which this could shape medium-term trends in fertility. By performing a comparative analysis, the project will attempt to identify and isolate the role of family planning restrictions in China in shaping these changes.</p>\n\n<p>The outcomes of the project will be fed into the family and population policy discourse in China, Taiwan and elsewhere in East Asia through a series of stakeholder workshops and policy briefs.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K001434/1","grantId":"ES/K001434/1","fundValue":"170144","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2016-03-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Stuart Arthur Basten","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
