The objectives of the study are threefold:</p>\n\n<ol>\n \n\n <li>to conceptualise and describe the workforce as it relates to multiple exclusion homelessness;</li>\n\n <li>to enhance understanding of how interprofessional collaboration works to identify and manage the intersections between homelessness and other facets of deep social exclusion;</li>\n\n <li>to make recommendations as regards for whom and when, and in what respects interprofessional collaboration might work best to prevent multiple exclusion homelessness. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The research is fieldwork based and is designed around an innovative partnership arrangement with three local voluntary housing support organisations situated in different locations across England (Cumbria, Halifax and London). The partners will assist the researches to: facilitate the research locally; engage people with direct experience of multiple exclusion homelessness in the research process; and develop and test the 'road worthiness' of the findings for practice and policy development. <br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/G030405/1","grantId":"ES/G030405/1","fundValue":"178876","fundStart":"2009-07-01","fundEnd":"2011-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  In an article reviewing the findings of the MEH Research Programme, Alice Evans, Head of Policy and Research at Homeless Link reports that 'This research provides vital evidence to help to help us develop policy and practice... It uncovers deep issues. It challenges our policy and practice. It shows how we need to change and how lives might be improved as a result' (Connect, The Magazine of the Homeless Sector, Issue 44, 2011, p15). \n[Impact on government policy] The Programme findings are taking centre stage in preparation of the next Ministerial Working Group on Homelessness (MWG) paper which is focussing on prevention and the importance of delivering integrated services that will tackle the complex causes of homelessness. \nWe have met with representatives from the Treasury and the Department of Health. The Programme findings are referenced in the latest NHS Confederation Briefing on Homelessness and Mental Health (2012, 235). This study has been assessed as being of national significance in personal correspondence received from the co-ordinator of the 'Research and Evidence Sub-group of the National Skills Consortium for Drug Misuse'. \n [Impact on frontline practice and people with experience of MEH] In our research findings summary we describe the practice changes that were made across the three fieldwork sites as a direct result of participating in this research. In terms of improved access to community care assessment and a fuller range of coordinated services, including direct payments, we have asked housing support workers in the partner agencies to keep us informed which we means we have been able to capture something of the direct impact this study is now having on people with experience of multiple exclusion homelessness. Many barriers persist and progress is very slow.

These services often work in parallel with health and social care services. As a result, we found little evidence of integrated assessment and support planning. One housing support worker summed up the situation in that 'Everyone has got snippets of the individual but no one is collating it'. \n\n\n\nProblems arise when needs extend beyond those which can be catered for within housing related support services meaning that some people (usually those with the most complex needs) fall through the gaps of existing provision. Services need to work together in innovative ways to stop people falling through these 'cracks'. \n\n\n\nHousing support workers play a key role in helping people to manage their home. However, because they often work in isolation from other professionals they can sometimes feel 'out of their depth' especially when the person they are supporting experiences a mental health crisis. We conclude that there is a need to reconceptualise the 'job role' of the housing support worker to ensure a better fit with the realities of working practices and to find new ways to support these largely unqualified workers in what is a very emotional and challenging role. The findings of this research have been developed for use in frontline health, housing and social care practice.
