Up to 80 per cent of removed nitrogen is emitted in the form of N2O, which is a strong greenhouse gas and ozone depletant. This fact is well reported for treatment of agricultural wastes but not for the treatment of communal/industrial waste water. This difference between reports on agricultural and commercial waste water treatment may be due to the fact that, conventionally, the emission of nitrous oxide is seen to be cause by different bacteria involved in the water treatment process. Inventories of gaseous emissions from commercial treatment works thus may have missed out a potentially significant source of this gas. The proposed research aims to investigate, under controlled conditions in a laboratory, whether the treatment of communal/industrial waste water for nitrogen removal can principally lead to significant releases of nitrous oxide. Comparison between these results and those available for the agricultural sector will establish if there are generic differences in N2O emission potential between these two sectors. The results will be used in the formulation of a strategy for further research into i) the quanitification and abatement of N2O from industrial/communal waste waters or ii) further reduction of N2O from agricultural waste water treatment, respectively.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D000270/1","grantId":"BB/D000270/1","fundValue":"90564","fundStart":"2006-01-05","fundEnd":"2007-10-04","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  No, as indicated in the other sections of the return, the findings were inconclusive as to the reason for the identified increased proportion of N2O release from the treatment of agricultural waste waters.\nAlso, other treatment means are now dominant in the UK, so that the threat of increased emission is less likely.  ","person":"Ole  Pahl","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Glasgow Caledonian University","findingsText":" This project shows that the treatment of industrial or communal waste waters does not lead to significant emissions of nitrous oxide and that neither higher amounts of inert solids nor the general nature (matrix) of agricultural waste waters have a significant effect on N2O emissions. However, it does not provide an explanation as to why high emissions can occur in an agricultural context; this aspect still merits further investigation. It is unlikely that this work will lead directly to routes for exploitation. The results have been inconclusive in terms of emissions abatement and in the identification of a key difference between the two systems in which biological nitrogen removal is used: (municipal) waste water treatment and agricultural slurry treatment.\n\n\n\nThe topic is still under investigation by other researchers.
