{"id":"AE899549-BA21-41F1-AA85-775A6EFD05E3","title":"A CYCLOADDITION STRATEGY FOR ARYLPHOSPHINE SYNTHESIS","abstractText":"Small quantites of metal catalysts can greatly affect the chemistry of simple organic molecules, leading to more efficient and cost effective processes. The metallic agent is very often added to a reaction as a complex, meaning that the metal centre is surrounded by other organic molecules known as ligands. The ligands help solubilise the metal species but they also play an important role in fine tuning the chemistry that takes place at the metal centre. This project aims to develop a very quick method for making a wide range of ligands that are based around a phosphorus centre. Indeed, phosphine based ligands are amongst the most popular and important in metal catalysed reactions. If successful, this project will deliver new ligands that have the potential to greatly improve the efficiency and selectivity of many reactions, allowing a diverse range of fine chemicals to be made available by cheap and simple processes.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D03213X/1","grantId":"EP/D03213X/1","fundValue":"100082","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Possibly but only have informal indication Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology ","person":"Joseph Patrick Anthony Harrity","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
