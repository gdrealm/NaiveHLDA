Delineating the crossover control networks in plants (DeCOP)","abstractText":"Meiosis is a specialized type of cell division required for sexual reproduction. It ensures the reduction\nof the genome and the recombination of maternal and paternal chromosomal segments prior to the\nformation of generative cells. The process of meiotic recombination is initiated by programmed DNA\ndouble-strand breaks (DSBs), introduced by the conserved Spo11 protein. Ultimately, the positions of\nthe DSBs define loci of mutual genetic exchange. However, in a single meiotic cell only a small subset\nof DSBs are destined to form genetic crossovers (COs), while the remainder are repaired via non-\nCO pathways. CO formation itself is subject to stringent control, which ensures that each homologue\npair receives at least one obligate CO. A phenomenon known as CO interference then ensures that\nmost (~85%) additional COs do not occur in an adjacent chromosomal region. As a result multiple\nCOs are spaced well apart along the homologues. Understanding the factors that control DSB\nformation and processing to form COs is of fundamental scientific interest, moreover this knowledge\nwill have important implications for manipulating meiotic recombination in crop plants.\nIn recent years meiosis research in plants has largely focussed on the identification of meiotic\ngenes/proteins involved in recombination pathways or the organization of the chromosome axes and\nsynaptonemal complex. Although these studies clearly demonstrate the importance of these proteins, it\nremained mostly enigmatic how their activities are coordinated to ensure the controlled formation of\nCOs. Hence this collaborative project (DeCOP) seeks to shift emphasis to focus on how\nrecombination, chromosome organisation and remodelling are orchestrated to control the frequency\nand distribution of COs. Specifically, we seek to identify the protein networks that determine the fate\nof individual DSBs and establish when CO interference is established. We propose to 1) perform an\ninnovative screen to identify novel factors that modulate CO formation and interference, 2) investigate\nthe role of chromosome axis-associated proteins in CO maturation and interference, 3) determine the\nrole of (ATM/ATR mediated) phosphorylation in coordinating meiotic DNA repair and CO formation\nand 4) to identify proteins involved in the final step of CO formation.\nThe factors and processes studied in the DeCOP project will significantly enhance our\nunderstanding of the networks that govern crossover formation in plants. We therefore anticipate that\nour findings will strongly stimulate future crop breeding programmes.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/M004937/1","grantId":"BB/M004937/1","fundValue":"286728","fundStart":"2014-06-30","fundEnd":"2017-06-29","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  We collaborate with plant biotechnology industry to use our knowledge within the context of crop breeding and improvement.
