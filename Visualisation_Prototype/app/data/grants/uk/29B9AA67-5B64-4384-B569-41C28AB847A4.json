Recently the almost complete DNA sequence of humans has been worked out, and there are between 20-30 thousand human protein coding genes. Although this is a big number, most recent estimates have shown that the protein number in human cells actually far exceeds the number of genes. An important question has now become how does the cell bridge the gap in numbers. One important way seems to be to use the same gene to encode more than one protein. The 1993 Nobel Prize was awarded for the important discovery that the genes of organisms like humans are split between bits that encode proteins (called exons) separated by non-coding regions (called introns). DNA is copied into RNA which in turn is used to make protein. After RNA is made, exons are joined together in the cell, by removing introns to give the template which encodes protein. Frequently different exon combinations are included into RNA from the same gene, resulting in variation. For instance, sometimes some of the exons are removed along with the introns. This process (called alternative splicing) is critically important in development, and might even have been an important evolutionary step in allowing the development of multicellularity. Despite this, it has not been studied as much as the controls (transcription) which decide which genes are turned on and off to make the RNA in the first place. Alternative RNA splicing is controlled by proteins which bind to RNA in the nucleus. Some of these proteins are not made in every part of the body but only in particular tissues such as the brain or the testis. Evidence so far suggests that these are likely to have very important roles. One of these RNA binding proteins, called T-STAR, is of particular interest since it may play roles in splicing and connecting signalling pathways with RNA processing and possibly even transcription during development. A good way of investigating the function of a human gene is to look at the equivalent mouse gene, and we propose to test the role of T-STAR in mouse development. Mice, like humans, have a T-STAR gene which is turned on in the adult testis, developing brain and kidney. Although mouse and human T-STAR proteins are virtually identical, they have an important difference in that they are regulated differently. For this reason we predict that T-STAR protein will regulate the same genes differently in humans and mice, and this might help explain some of the reasons mice are different from humans. We will make a conditional version of the T-STAR gene in mice. Next, we can inactivate this conditional T-STAR by cutting an important part of it out of the chromosome when we want to. The way we do this is by mating the mice with special mice which express another protein called a 'recombinase'. We will first remove T-STAR from every cell in the mouse body by turning on the recombinase in every cell. We expect to see defects in the brain, kidney and germ cells,but it could be that these mice will die while they are developing . For this reason, we will also selectively remove T-STAR in the testis (where the sperm are made). This is the main site of T-STAR expression in the adult, and it is an unusual organ because you can see all the major stages of sperm development occurring in the adult and it is non-essential. The mice might be infertile but they will not die. Hence by removing T-STAR in this tissue, even if we get a block in development we will be able to analyse this in the adult mouse and obtain mutant cells. We will analyse gene expression in these mice to see if different genes are expressed, and if transcripts contain different exons from mice which do not contain the deletion. To find out if these mouse genes are regulated differently in humans, we will then compare transcription and splicing patterns of genes affected by T-STAR deletion in the mouse with their human counterparts..","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D013917/1","grantId":"BB/D013917/1","fundValue":"372996","fundStart":"2006-03-10","fundEnd":"2010-03-09","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The impact of this project is still in the academic area.

","person":"David  Elliott","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":" Alternative RNA splicing is a mechanism which can amplify the content of the genome, by allowing each individual gene to make multiple mRNAs, sometimes encoding different proteins. Some RNA binding proteins are present in families. This BBSRC funded project analysed the function of the RNA binding protein T-STAR, which was created following a gene triplication 520-610 million years ago. This gene triplication also produced two other sister genes (paralogs) encoding similar proteins called Sam68 and SLM-1. This means that all bony vertebrates have a T-STAR protein, but this had no known function. We used mouse genetics to try to find out what the function of T-STAR is. We created a mouse strain which did not expressT-STAR protein. Mice null for T-STAR developed normally and were fertile, surprisingly given the high expression of T-STAR in the testis and the brain. We carefully analysed the different mRNAs made in the brains of these mice (these different mRNAs are called the alternatively spliced forms) to try and find RNA splicing events controlled by T-STAR. We managed to identify very specific splicing defects in the mRNAs from a a group of genes called Neurexins, and also in a functionally related gene. There are also three Neurexin genes, and alternative splicing of each of these was affected in the same place. These Neurexin alternative exons were used more frequently when T-STAR protein was missing than in normal mice, showing T-STAR works as a potent splicing repressor of these exons. We correlated splicing patterns observed in normal mice with T-STAR expression levels in different brain regions. Regions of high T-STAR protein concentration correlated with high levels of splicing repression. To get some idea of how this was working, we made &amp;quot;minigenes&amp;quot; which expressed the alternative exons we had identified in cultured cells, either with our without also adding T-STAR protein. We also analysed interactions between T-STAR protein and its target RNAs in the test tube. These experiments showed that the splicing effects of T-STAR were caused by direct interaction with the Neurexin RNAs in the nucleus, and we were able to map the binding site involved. Amazingly, these binding sites were highly conserved in bony vertebrates, suggesting an ancient mechanism of splicing control by T-STAR, explaining why it might have been conserved for so long in evolution. To test this, we also examined whether a zebrafish alternative exon could be regulated by human and mouse T-STAR proteins, and we found it could. Although the splicing targets of T-STAR which we identified in this project encode critical synaptic proteins, T-STAR null mice had no detectable spatial memory deficits, despite an almost complete absence of AS4 splicing repression in the hippocampus. This means that there must be some more subtle effect of losing the T-STAR protein, which none the less must be important in the wild. Our work identifies T-STAR as an ancient and potent tissue-specific splicing regulator which uses a concentration-dependent mechanism to co-ordinately regulate regional splicing patterns of the Neurexin1-3 AS4 exons in the mouse brain. This work provides a really nice story which could be used for teaching and public engagement to show how science works. We started by asking what a protein does, and this led us to identify an unexpected role in a very hot area of behavioural biology and neurology. The Neurexins are very important proteins in the normal nervous system, and also play a role in diseases such as autism and schizophrenia. Understanding how T-STAR controls these proteins might therefore be exploited in a medical context, as well as for understanding how the nervous system normally develops. Alternative splicing of Neurexins is used as a teaching example of how single genes can make multiple mRNAs. Our work now adds the mechanism to this story, and also provides a mouse strain to which will be useful to identify the functional consequences when this alternative splicing is blocked.
