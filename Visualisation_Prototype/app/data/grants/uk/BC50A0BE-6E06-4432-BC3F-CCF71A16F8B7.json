{"id":"BC50A0BE-6E06-4432-BC3F-CCF71A16F8B7","title":"Rolling Grant","abstractText":"A Rolling Grant is designed to support a programme of research within a particular domain. The domain in this case is Space Science, in particular the fields of: 1. Compact Objects (Black Holes and Neutron Stars, seeking to understand the physics associated with the enormously compact objects. this includes studying Gamma-ray bursts (giant supernovae in distant galaxies), isolated neutron stars including those with gigantic magnetic fields, and black holes); 2. Galaxy Formation and Evolution (Understanding these processes using extremely sophisticated computer modelling techniques. Looking at the role of Active Galactic Nuclei, the history of star formation and the role of feedback) 3. Magnetic Coupling and the Heliosphere (The emergence of magnetic field structures on the Sun, how solar eruptions are triggered, the creation of the Solar Wind and how it affects the Earth); 4. Plasma Physics of the Terrestrial and Planetary Environments (The Earth and some other planets are surrounded and protected by magnetic fields which provide a local laboratory for fundamental research into how charged particles interact with complex magnetic field structures. Through the use of in-situ space probes we will study these processes to gain a fuller understanding of this important physics. Many solar system bodies do not have a protective magnetic field and so we will also study the these interactions, especially planets and moons with an atmospheres (e.g. Mars and Titan)); 5. Planetary Surfaces (The surfaces of planets, particularly Mars, provide interesting and alternative geological and meteorological settings to the Earth. We plan to use the plethora of observational data available from currently orbiting spacecraft to study in great detail these terrains). 6. Enabling technologies (Miniature, very low temperature coolers, auroral imagers and plasma analysers will be developed. New methods of constructing 3-dimensional models of planetary surfaces will be produced. A study will be made (with impact trials) of the survivability of an instrumented penetrator into ice at around 700 miles per hour).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/H00260X/1","grantId":"ST/H00260X/1","fundValue":"4620160","fundStart":"2010-04-01","fundEnd":"2013-09-30","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"A  Smith","coPersons":["Kinwah  Wu","Sarah Anna Matthews","Mathew James Page","Silvia  Zane","Mark Scott Cropper","Andrew Neil Fazakerley","Christopher John Owen","Ian  Hepburn","Lidia Maria Van Driel-Gesztelyi","Ignacio  Ferreras","Adrian Palmer Jones","David Ronan Williams","Daisuke  Kawata","Andrew John Coates","Louise Kim Harra","Geraint Hughes Jones","Graziella  Branduardi-Raymont","Jan-Peter  Muller"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
