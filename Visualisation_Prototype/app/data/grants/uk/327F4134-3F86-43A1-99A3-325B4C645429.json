For example, diagram algebras are, in one sense, abstract algebras, but they are also rather direct models of algebraic structures which can be seen in the physical world (from the connectivity of integratedcircuits, to the phase transitions in ferromagnetic materials). In them, powerful and elegant abstract mathematical techniques have a very concrete realisation, and very close cooperation with physicalinsight. This workshop is intended to bring together several world leaders in fields exemplified by this paradigm, with experts in physical world systems of present or potential application, as well as promising young researchers from both sides. The aim is to take full stock of, and coordinate, progress so far, and to drive forward work in this exciting confluence of mathematics and physics.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E021328/1","grantId":"EP/E021328/1","fundValue":"14184","fundStart":"2006-12-06","fundEnd":"2007-04-05","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Paul Purdon Martin","coPersons":[],"organisation":"City University London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
