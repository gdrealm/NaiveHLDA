The narratives had been collected as part of a previous study with a carefully crafted experimental design, where equal mixes of male and female doctors, some of whom were very experienced and some of whom were much less so, viewed video-tapes of actors portraying patients with depression. Video presentations were of an equal mix of black and white male and female patients, half of whom were portrayed as school teachers and half as cleaners. Each doctor saw only one video patient with depression, but the video they saw was carefully selected so that across the sample of 128 doctors providing narratives about depression care, equal numbers of male and female and more or less experienced doctors spoke about black or white male and female patients, who were either portrayed as teachers or cleaners.\n\nWe hypothesised that we would see less elaborate decision making processes for black compared with white patients presenting with depression, characterised by doctors recalling fewer things about them, considering a smaller range of possible patient problems or diagnoses for them, giving less thought to the outcomes of different courses of possible interventions, and ordering fewer tests and treatments for black compared with white patients. \n\nOur findings however suggest greater clinical uncertainty in diagnosing depression amongst black compared with white patients, particularly in the UK. This was evident in doctors coming up with more potential diagnoses for black compared with white patients. There was also a tendency for doctors in both countries to focus more on black patients’ physical rather than psychological symptoms and to identify endocrine problems, most often diabetes, as a presenting complaint for them. This suggests that doctors in both countries have a less well developed mental model of depression for black compared with white patients. \n\nOutputs: a paper published in Social Science and Medicine and a software package designed to facilitate our approach to data coding.\n\nIn a second study we focussed on patient perspectives of depression consultations. We made video-tapes of black and white male and female doctors conducting a typical depression consultation, filmed as a series of linked segments e.g. exploring patients’ symptoms, exploring family history of depression, exploring thoughts about medication etc. The segments were designed to allow patients to respond to an open question posed at the end of each one, and doctors’ scripted responses were sufficiently general to allow them to appear responsive to whatever patients offered. Half of the doctors were scripted to have a ‘high patient-centred style’ and half to have a ‘low patient-centred’ style of communication. The video-tapes were shown to 640 subjects, who were invited to think about a time in their lives when they had felt depressed for a period of two weeks of more, and to respond as they would have done during that period. Participants were recorded interacting with the video doctors. Half of the sample of subjects (whom we called analogue patients) was from the US and half from the UK. Half were black and half were white, and there was an equal mix of men and women, half of whom had previously been treated for depression and half of whom had not. \n\nWe hypothesised that it would be easier for white patients to disclose their depression to doctors than black patients; and further, that patients would find it easier to trust and disclose to doctors where they shared the same race and/or gender background. However all of our analyses pointed to the importance of doctors’ communication style being the most important factor in facilitating patients’ disclosure. This is good news, since there are far fewer doctors of African race descent in both the US and the UK, so that patients cannot be guaranteed that they will consult with a doctor from a similar background to themselves.\n\nWe also found that white patients talk more about depression than black patients – in terms of the quantity of words used. There are also notable differences in the ways in which they talk about in – in the types of words and in the metaphors and similes used.\n\nOutputs: one paper published so far in Patient Education and Counseling, with three others in preparation; a follow-on proposal to the ESRC for secondary data analysis (not funded).\n\nIn a third study we are analysing a database of real patient assessments of the risks of suicide, self-harm, harm to others, self-neglect and vulnerability, and clinicians decisions about the level of risk present for each patient. The research team has developed the database and the decision support system which generates it, which is called the Galatean Risk and Safety Tool (GRiST, www.egrist.org). This is in use in the UK in mental health trusts, in private hospitals and care homes, and in third sector mental health care provider organisations. Current analysis is examining race and gender differences in the profiles of information clinicians collect about patients and in their overall judgments about the level of risk present in each patient’s case. We are also analysing clinicians’ judgments about the level of risk present when they are presented with real patient ris profiles where details of the patients’ race and gender have been altered.\n\nOutputs: a peer reviewed publication is planned.
