The proposal is in two, linked parts. In the first, the general methodology will be extended to: encompass a wider range of metals; exert control over particle size and metal oxidation state; employ block co-polymer templates to access cubic pore morphologies and to extend the preparation of bimetallic particles. The second part focuses on real-world catalytic applications using catalysts produced using this methodology, namely automotive exhaust emission control and selective hydrogenation of allylic species.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F009488/1","grantId":"EP/F009488/1","fundValue":"325191","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Duncan  Bruce","coPersons":["Adam Fraser Lee","Karen  Wilson"],"organisation":"University of York","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
