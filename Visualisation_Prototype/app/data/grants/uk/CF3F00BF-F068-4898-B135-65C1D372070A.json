If this huge reservoir of carbon was to be released back in to the atmosphere it would cause a significant rise in carbon dioxide and release methane and result in further global warming. At the moment scientists are trying to unravel the mechanisms that control the losses and gains of carbon from this large area of the Earth's surface.\n\nPeatlands often have natural pools of water within them. However, we know little about what role these pools play in the peatland carbon cycle. Furthermore, many new pools are being created in peatlands by humans as they try to restore degraded peatlands. This is because many degraded peatlands have previously been drained using ditches. These ditches are now being blocked up with small dams thereby creating tens of thousands of new pools along the length of the blocked ditches.\n\nOur project seeks to examine the role of natural and artificial pools in the peatland carbon cycle. It will measure flows of water and carbon into and out of pools in order to understand whether the pools play an important role in processing the carbon.\n\nAdditionally it is known that many peatlands contain connected cavities within them known as soil pipes. These are not artificial pipes, but just natural connected holes within the peat. Some peatland pools which are connected to pipes may therefore be connected to large carbon sources from some distance away, but no-one has ever studied this before. \n\nIn summary, this project will investigate the role of pools in carbon cycling within northern peatlands. It will seek to understand processes operating in and around pools and the role of natural pipes in mediating these processes. It will focus on two pool types: natural pools and pools that have been created through peatland restoration by damming of drainage ditches. For both pool types we will examine those that are connected to pipes and those that are unconnected to pipes.\n\nThis work is fundamental to our understanding of the role of peatlands in the global carbon cycle. Without this research we will be unable to properly predict carbon fluxes from peatlands under climate change scenarios because we will not understand what drives carbon cycling in peatland pools. The work is urgent: without it we will be unable to explain how the large number of pools currently being created by practitioners via drain blocking is affecting carbon cycling within, and carbon release from, peatlands. The results from this project are also vital to informing the future management and restoration of peatlands in order to optimise their potential to mitigate global warming.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/J006629/1","grantId":"NE/J006629/1","fundValue":"133274","fundStart":"2012-08-17","fundEnd":"2013-08-11","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Michael Frank Billett","coPersons":["Kerry  Dinsmore"],"organisation":"NERC Centre for Ecology and Hydrology","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
