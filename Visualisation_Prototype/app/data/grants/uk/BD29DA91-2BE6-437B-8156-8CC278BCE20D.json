Following the lives of over 19,000 children born across the UK around the turn of the millennium, it has collected information about and from them at ages nine months, three, five, seven and eleven years.</p>\n\n<p>Sweep six will comprise a further survey of the MCS cohort at age 14 as a critical point in young people's lives.This is a time when people are in-between childhood and adulthood, when many trajectories are still possible, but many will also be heavily influenced by the choices and behaviours they engage in at this age. The measures we capture at age 14 will be significant for addressing their relation to later life outcomes and enabling understanding of change over time through cross-cohort comparisons.</p>\n\n<p>The age 14 sweep will utilise a variety of data collection instruments comprising interviews and self-completion with both parents; interview and self-completion with the cohort member; measures of height, weight and body fat; direct assessments of cognitive functioning; a time diary; and collection of consent to administrative data linkage.</p>\n\n<p>MCS Sweep six will cover the age 14 survey development; data collection; data deposit; dissemination, capacity building and user engagement.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K005987/1","grantId":"ES/K005987/1","fundValue":"7033930","fundStart":"2013-04-01","fundEnd":"2017-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Morag  HendersonLucinda  PlattEmla Olivia Fitzsimons","coPersons":["Jon  Johnson","Lisa  Calderwood"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
