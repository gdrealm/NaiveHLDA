{"id":"2A96DFF1-6B0E-40BA-BF9E-4D5D7A8EA498","title":"The segmentation of sign language: native and non-native abilities","abstractText":"<p>This research project addresses the ‘segmentation problem’. Speech and sign are continuous signals and must be segmented into their component words or signs to be understood. A substantial body of research has examined how adult listeners segment continuous speech eg through the 'possible word constraint' (McQueen, 2004).</p>\n\n<p>There are two primary research questions on this project. First, how do users of a sign language perceive and visually segment the sign stream in order to isolate individual signs and hence retrieve the syntactic and semantic content of signed messages? Second, do sign perceivers segment the sign stream by a process analagous to the 'possible word constraint'?</p>\n\n<p>The project will also explore if sign segmentation depends on a critical period for age of first exposure to sign language.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-23-1450","grantId":"RES-000-23-1450","fundValue":"331293","fundStart":"2006-04-03","fundEnd":"2009-09-02","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  sign language teaching/research  ","person":"Gary David Morgan","coPersons":[],"organisation":"City University London","findingsText":" similarities and differences between sign and spoken language segmentation further research Education","dataset":"gtr"}
