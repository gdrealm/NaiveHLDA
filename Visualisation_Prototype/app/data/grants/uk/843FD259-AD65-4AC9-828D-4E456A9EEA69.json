Partners, including WillisRE Ltd., ForestRe Ltd., Ecometrica Ltd, Acclimatise Ltd. The Edinburgh Centre on Climate Change, and Forest Research will contribute more than &pound;55,000 in-cash and in-kind to this KE initiative. A PDRA will be appointed to effectively bring together the NERC funded and UK research community (on forest-loss risks) as well as to proactively engage with potential users (Brokers &amp; End users). \n\nThis initiative stems from (a) recommendations made at the NERC-funded Long Finance symposia on &quot;Forestry and Finance: Where's the data&quot; (London, July 2010 and Sept 2010), to which the PI (Patenaude) was an invited panellist and (b) the wider KE activities led by Richard Max-Lino (NERC Knowledge and Innovation Manager, Financial Services) and the Long Finance initiative (http://www.zyen.com/long-finance.html).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/I022183/1","grantId":"NE/I022183/1","fundValue":"99283","fundStart":"2011-08-22","fundEnd":"2012-11-21","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  Our findings can be (and have been) taken forward by the insurance industry in their design of entirely new products focussing on hazards (e.g. pest and diseases, fires).

Our focus has been on the risks that natural and anthropogenic hazards pose to forests. Identifying the synergies and divergence between these sectors has helped to identify how academic impact can be maximised (e.g. by helping to design products useful for, e.g. the insurance industry). Our findings can be (and have been) taken forward by the insurance industry in their design of entirely new products focussing on hazards (e.g. pest and diseases, fires). Additionally, forest carbon standards (e.g. the UK woodland carbon code) is currently being informed by our research on improving risks assessment. Finally, the development of protocols for quantifying risks in different sectors (investors, insurers and forest carbon standards) are using our databases of risks to improve their assessment.
