{"id":"D21A12EB-F055-4BD5-9C8C-DB23750CC409","title":"New Horizons in Chemical and Photochemical Dynamics","abstractText":"Chemical change, whether caused by collisions between reactive atoms, radicals and molecules, or by absorption of light (photochemistry), is of fundamental importance in all branches of Chemistry. For example, synthesis of complicated organic molecules, such as those naturally occurring in plant and animal life, or needed to construct functional modern materials, requires an in-depth understanding of reaction mechanisms to design synthetic pathways. Ideas from physical chemistry based on thermodynamics and reaction rate theory underpin our ability to predict directions of chemical change and how quickly such change will occur. The fields of chemical reaction and photodissociation have sought to place such theories on a quantitative foundation built on deep understanding of the quantum mechanics of breakage and formation of chemical bonds. Potential energy surfaces (PESs) (based on the Born-Oppenheimer separation of the fast motion of light electrons from the slower motion of heavier atomic nuclei) are an essential concept because they provide a map of the energy landscape(s) over which chemical change occurs. Minima and barriers on the PESs correspond, respectively, to stable conformations of the atoms and short-lived transition states. Photodissociation involves dynamics on PESs lying higher in energy than the lowest, ground state, with the extra energy needed to reach these excited states provided by absorption of light. A powerful driver for advances in understanding of the dynamics of photochemical and reactive processes has been a close interaction between experimental and theoretical studies - arguably, the field has done much to stimulate the development of theoretical methods to calculate PE landscapes and describe the molecular dynamics on these surfaces. Such methods (subject to simplifying approximations) are now finding widespread use in molecular modelling of, for example, drug design, enzyme catalysis, and many other fields. The historical development of experimental and theoretical methods has relied on complementary studies of systems with only a small number of atoms (e.g. photodissociation of diatomic and triatomic molecules; reaction of atoms with diatomic molecules) so that accurate PESs can be computed and precise, quantum-mechanical (QM) scattering calculations carried out. Such experiments were mostly conducted in the gas phase, in the low-temperature and rarefied environment of a molecular beam, so that complicating factors of solvation, or interaction between molecules can be ignored. Considerable success with such systems has, for example, revealed the importance of exotic QM effects in chemistry such as tunnelling through reaction barriers, scattering resonances, non-adiabatic coupling between PESs, and interference between different pathways to the same products. For a photochemical or reactive system with 3 atoms, only 3 coordinates are required to describe all the possible arrangements of the atoms and the associated PEs can thus be computed for representative configurations spanning the entire PE landscape. We now seek a multi-pronged approach to extend such studies to more complicated systems, with the intention of learning about PE landscapes for larger molecules (for N atoms, 3N-6 coordinates are needed to describe the associated PE hypersurface), the effects of jumps between PE surfaces, and to examine how the energy landscapes and chemical dynamics are changed in the presence of solvent. In so doing, we will bring the fields of reaction and photodissociation dynamics closer to the types of chemical reactions used in synthesis by organic, inorganic and biological chemists. Our strategy involves development of new experiments and theoretical methods. The substantial challenges necessitate a consortium-based approach, in which complementary expertise in two Universities is brought together to address selected problems from which we can learn much about chemical change.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G00224X/1","grantId":"EP/G00224X/1","fundValue":"5955190","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-03-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Developments in imaging mass spectrometry and in imaging methods are transferring to mass spectrometry manufacturers (e.g. Scientific Analysis Instruments Ltd)and manufacturers of scientific instrumentation for imaging (e.g. Photek Ltd, Photonis).\n\nThe development of the Danceroom Spectroscopy project is having a substantial cultural and educational impact: see http://danceroom-spec.com/ for a list of activities.

The use of new technology to study such chemical processes is also leading to innovations in broader areas such as analytical science. Full details of the project are given at the website http://dynamics.chem.ox.ac.uk/ and a few key outcomes to date are summarized here. (1) Advances in mass spectrometry using novel imaging detectors that can provide both spatial and velocity information. (2) Breakthroughs in the study of chemical and photochemical processes occuring in solution in liquids using femtosecond laser based transient absoprtion methods and new theoretical methods for accurate simulation of reactions in liquids. (3) Use of velocity map imaging (and related) methods to observe collisional scattering and photodissociation mechanisms with quantum-state resolution, and to explore non-adiabatic dynamics at conical intersections between electronic states. (4) Advances in fundamental theory of chemical reactions, and of the theoretical treatment of bulk liquids. (5) Develpment and application of new methods to study collisions at ultra-low temperatures.\n\n\n\nThe consortium has published more than130 papers in international journals over the course of the grant. A representative selection of these papers is given here, and a comprehensive list is available at the website http://dynamics.chem.ox.ac.uk/ Much of the work is fundamental in nature and the most immediate impacts will be in the academic arena. However, as indicated above, advances in mass spectrometry and in reaction theory can have wider consequences. The former may lead to new analytical instrumentation of importance in medicine and biology. The latter - e.g. through incorporation of new theoretical methods in established modelling programs such as CHARMM - will improve computational simulations of chemistry of interest in a variety of areas that include pharamceuticals. Some of the fundamental ideas of chemical reactivity that we use and develop have been incorporated into an innovative art and public engagement project &amp;quot;Danceroom Spectroscopy&amp;quot; - see e.g. http://www.bris.ac.uk/changingperspectives/projects/danceroom-spectroscopy/\n\n which is receiving wide interest in the media, at art and music festivals and modern art institutes, and will be part of the 2012 Cultural Olympiad. We have published the outcomes of our work in leading journals including Science and Nature Chemistry. The work is already impacting on understanding of classes of reactions such as enzyme catalysis with broad importance in chemical and biological sciences (e.g. recent Nature Chemistry article by Glowacki et al.) Our work on ultrafast dynamics in liquids is providing new methods for the quantitative study of how a solvent affects reaction pathways, with significance in all areas of chemistry. Incorporation of novel imaging methods into mass spectrometry will lead to new ways to image biological (or other) samples with spatially resolved chemical composition information. Patents have been awarded for new detector technologies, and these are now being exploited for chemical dynamics and mass spectrometry research.
