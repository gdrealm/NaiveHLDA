The most striking differences found in speakers of English and speakers of unwritten languages in remote traditional cultures. However, these groups differ in other ways, such as educational level, exposure to artificially coloured materials and motivation to succeed at abstract tasks that are irrelevant to their daily life. </p> \n<p>The current project will instead compare a range of naming, perception and memory tasks in English speakers and Korean speakers. The Korean language also names different colour categories than English, but has more, rather than fewer categories. Korean students are educated to the same level and have the same experience of artificially coloured materials. Their visual and cultural environments are more similar. So, if differences in perception and memory are also found between Korean and English speakers, then it is more likely that there is a true strong relationship between language and thought, which is not an artefact of Western testing methods. </p> \n<p>We will also consider whether having more than eleven basic categories would be more or less useful for discriminating and remembering colours. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-1527","grantId":"RES-000-22-1527","fundValue":"44879","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2006-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Deborah  Roberson","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Essex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
