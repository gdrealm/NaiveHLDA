{"id":"D917BEFF-07E4-4FAB-BEF6-965803430318","title":"A Specialised Computational Resource for Biomolecular Simulation","abstractText":"Molecular dynamics is a computer simulation method that allows one to visualise the ways in which molecules change shape, whether that is just as a result of thermal energy or as a result of interactions - maybe with other proteins or with small molecules, for example drugs. These changes in shape are critical for the ways in which biomolecules 'work', but at the moment no other experimenatl method allows us to styudy this clearly at the atomic level. Understanding molecular dynamics is vital if we are to explain how cell signalling works (and so for drug design), how cells, and ultimately whole organisms, move, and how to build artificial 'molecular machines' for nanotechnological applications.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F011407/1","grantId":"BB/F011407/1","fundValue":"76128","fundStart":"2008-03-01","fundEnd":"2009-02-28","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Charles  Laughton","coPersons":["Cristina  De Matteis","Max  Paoli","Jonas  Emsley","Peter Martin Fischer","Lodewijk Victor Dekker","Shudong  Wang"],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
