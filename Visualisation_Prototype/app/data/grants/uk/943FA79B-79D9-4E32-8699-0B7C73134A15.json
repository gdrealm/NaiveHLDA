Estimates at the small area level are also much needed in social science applications, such as poverty mapping. Standard household surveys are typically designed to produce precise estimates for larger areas and consequently do not provide sufficient precision at the small area level. Although significant developments in small area estimation techniques have been made over the past 25 years, less has been done in producing diagnostic methods with which to validate small area models. This study proposes to investigate cross-validation as a diagnostic tool for assessing small area models. Although cross-validation is a well established, data-based diagnostic method for model selection and comparison, it has so far been neglected within the field of small area estimation. The proposed technique would involve dividing survey data so that certain areas are used to estimate a particular variable, with the remaining areas used to validate the model estimates. The research will involve both simulated data and data from the UK census samples of anonymised records (SARs). The methods to be developed are intended to be usable in practice and thus should be accessible to those researchers in government, the social sciences and epidemiology who produce estimates at the small area level.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-1798","grantId":"RES-000-22-1798","fundValue":"65201","fundStart":"2006-07-01","fundEnd":"2007-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Chris  Skinner","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
