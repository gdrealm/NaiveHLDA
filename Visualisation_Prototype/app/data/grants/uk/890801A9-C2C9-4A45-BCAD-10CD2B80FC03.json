{"id":"890801A9-C2C9-4A45-BCAD-10CD2B80FC03","title":"The Solid State Quantum Network","abstractText":"Quantum communication, the transfer of quantum superposition states over long \ndistances, is presently limited to about 200km (both in optical fibre and free space) due to \nunavoidable photon absorption losses. This research aims to extend this \ndistance using &quot;entanglement swapping&quot; and &quot;teleportation&quot;. By \nconcatenating short entanglement swapping sub-sections it is in principle possible to \ngenerate entangled (correlated) bits over very long distances with bit rate only limited by the \nlosses in one short section. If realised this would extend quantum communication \napplications such as quantum cryptography and quantum teleportation out to distances of \nthousands of kilometres.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J00815X/1","grantId":"EP/J00815X/1","fundValue":"188894","fundStart":"2011-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Terence Graham Rudolph","coPersons":["Sean Duncan Barrett"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
