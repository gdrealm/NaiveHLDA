{"id":"3022CC73-0B3B-49D9-AF1D-B021FD2B0A02","title":"British Chinese On-line Identities: Participation and Inclusion","abstractText":"<p>This research explores the implications of the Internet for the identity formation and political participation of second generation British Chinese young people. Beyond an awareness of their high educational achievement, this group has been largely overlooked in debates about the nature of Britain as a multicultural society. The small size and geographical dispersal of the British Chinese population relative to other minority communities may give a greater importance to the Internet as a means of forging social networks.</p>\n\n<p>Our study will place particular emphasis on British Chinese people as both creators and consumers of on-line content through a close analysis of web sites and forums recently developed to address their experiences.</p>\n\n<p>The research will use an on-line survey to gather quantitative data on usage patterns, and the interplay between on-line and off-line social interaction. A series of focus group discussions and interviews will explore how British Chinese young people are using on-line forums and the associated face to face meetings they generate to develop social networks, and engage in new forms of political action.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-1642","grantId":"RES-000-22-1642","fundValue":"37892","fundStart":"2006-09-01","fundEnd":"2008-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"David  Parker","coPersons":["Miri  Song"],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
