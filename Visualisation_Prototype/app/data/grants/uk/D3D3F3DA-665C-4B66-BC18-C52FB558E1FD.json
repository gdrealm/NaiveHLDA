As responsible researchers and geneticists it is important that we take every opportunity to allay ?Frankenstein? fears, and disseminate realistic information as to where medical genetics is leading. As a Division we are often approached by the press and broadcast media for views on high profile genetic stories, and attempt to deal with them in as even-handed and accurate a manner as possible. We encourage secondary school students to visit our Division, sometimes as part of work experience, to see what sorts of projects and problems we are working on; various members of the Division often speak at schools and to lay audiences of various types. One of our clinical consultants, Dr Fred Kavalier, is a well-known journalist who writes a weekly column for The Independent, and is often consulted on issues of public understanding.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G9600577","grantId":"G9600577","fundValue":"1766370","fundStart":"1997-04-01","fundEnd":"2009-06-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Ellen  Solomon","coPersons":[],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
