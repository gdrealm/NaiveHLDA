Many people do not know they are developing OAG and miss out on the potential benefit of early treatment. This study develops the design for a randomised controlled trial (RCT) studying screening for OAG. \n\nScreening may be a good way to find and treat more people who have OAG. Screening involves inviting everybody who has a particular characteristic, for example of a certain age, for testing. However, we need to know that screening will reduce the number of people losing vision and that it is value for money compared with the current system of people choosing to attend for a sight test. To answer these questions we need a large, high quality research study, i.e. a randomised controlled trial (RCT).\n\nBefore we can conduct a screening RCT we have to determine which screening tests should be evaluated, where testing should take place and who to include. Also we need to know how best to measure benefits and any harms of screening. \n\nWe will seek the views of people who do and do not have glaucoma, as well as views of health care professionals involved in providing eye care services.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0701759","grantId":"G0701759","fundValue":"408886","fundStart":"2008-11-01","fundEnd":"2010-10-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Jennifer  Burr","coPersons":["Rodolfo  Hernandez","Augusto  Azuara-Blanco","Craig  Ramsay","Jilllian Joy Francis","David  Crabb","Alexandra  Greene","John  Norrie","Marion K Campbell","Roger Alan Hitchings","R  Wormwold","Luke  Vale"],"organisation":"University of Aberdeen","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
