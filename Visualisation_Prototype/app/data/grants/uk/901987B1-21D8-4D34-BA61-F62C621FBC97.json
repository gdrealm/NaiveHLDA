The project will research and develop novel fast semantic nearest neighbour search (FISH) data structure, algorithm and software utilities for rapidly discovering semantically similar neighbours of complex data objects and automatically assigning semantic class labels to them. It will use large scale, high dimensional, heterogeneous, incomplete, and noisy internet image labelling datasets as Case Study for technology development and evaluation. The FISH solutions and utilities can be directly applied to automatically label security surveillance videos and defence reconnaissance imageries to extract semantic meanings to facilitate security and defence intelligence gathering and analysis.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J020257/1","grantId":"EP/J020257/1","fundValue":"95625","fundStart":"2012-06-01","fundEnd":"2013-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The automatics image labeling method developed through this grant has found new applications in automatic habitat classification. Researchers from the British Ordinance Survey have shown great interest in applying the technologies to automatically categories habitats based on GPS-referenced ground photographs. Using data supplied by Ordinance Survey, we have successfully demonstrated the application of the Fast Semantic Nearest Neighbour Search (FISH) technologies developed in this grant to automatically classify habitats (Ecological Informatics, vol. 23, pp. 126-136, 2014). Habitat classification is important for monitoring the environment and biodiversity. Traditionally, this is done manually by human surveyors, a laborious, expensive and subjective process. Automatic habitat classification has the advantage and potential of improving efficiency, reducing cost, and removing subjectivity. Therefore, the grant has the potential impact of assisting environment protection as well as improving efficiency thus producing positive economy and societal impacts.

In the &quot;big data&quot; era, advanced data analysis technologies and tools such as nearest neighbour search are fundamentally important. In this project we have made significant advances through developing the Fast Semantic Nearest Neighbour Search (FISH) technologies, in particular we have developed the following new technologies and applications\n\n(1) A random forest based fast semantic nearest neighbour search method that tackles two fundamental drawbacks of traditional methods: scalability and semantic gap. The new method is based on tree data structure which is intrinsically fast and scalable. The new method finds neighbours that are not only close in the feature space but also have similar semantic meanings overcoming traditional methods that can only find neighbours that are close in the feature space but have very different semantic meanings. This is a new generic nearest neighbour search technique that overcomes the two fundamental weaknesses of traditional methods. \n\n(2) The new FISH method has been successfully applied to automatically label images and videos with what they contains. For example, for an image of a harbor taken during sunset, our new algorithm can label it with the meaningful words such as &quot;sunset&quot;, &quot;water&quot;, &quot;boat&quot;, etc. This is very useful for managing large image databases and for search relevant images on the Internet. \n\n(3) New methods based on FISH for automatically classify habitants. This is the first time that image-labeling technology has been applied to automatically label ground photographs with the habitats they contain. This has open up the new possibility of using computer algorithms to replace traditional labour intensive approach to habitat classification. The FISH technologies can be programmed into a data analysis tool for finding semantic nearest neighbours in generic data analysis tasks. \n\nThe FISH technologies can be programmed into image analysis tools for automatically labeling images and videos with what they contain, and for searching semantically similar images from the Internet or large image repositories.\n\nThe FISH technologies can be programmed to build automatic habitat classification tools.
