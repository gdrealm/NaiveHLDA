{"id":"821CB9E4-5585-47C8-BFA7-BD175FD642A0","title":"Technologies for Re-Active Noise-cancelling Quiet panels (TRANQuil)","abstractText":"The aim of this project is to integrate three novel technologies in order to implement a &quot;Smart Panel&quot; as a flexible system for the active control of low frequency sound and vibration. This system would then be demonstrated on a number of increasingly challenging industrial applications, including panels on coaches, in luxury yachts and in open plan offices. The three technologies involve a novel transducer that combines mechanical actuation with vibration sensing, a moulded phenolic panel, whose characteristics can be tailored for passive as well as active noise control and an advanced signal processing algorithm that will allow the performance of the system to adapt to the particular application.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J500768/1","grantId":"EP/J500768/1","fundValue":"137677","fundStart":"2012-06-01","fundEnd":"2015-08-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Steve  Elliott","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
