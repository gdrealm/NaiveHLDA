A Study of the Work of Emine Sevgi &Ouml;zdamar, Zafer Senocak, and Feridun Zaimoglu","abstractText":"My project is a book-length study of Turkish-German literature which views it as a powerful force of transculturation in Germany, rather than a marginal site of diasporic cultural production. Research to date has interpreted this writing mainly in terms of conventional paradigms such as migration, integration, or intercultural dialogue. Only one critic (Adelson 2005) has attempted to adopt new reading strategies to liberate unpredictable meaning from this body of work. My own book will focus on the three most prominent German writers of Turkish origin today: Emine Sevgi &Ouml;zdamar (1946- ), Zafer Senocak (1961- ), and Feridun Zaimoglu (1964- ), each of whose work constitutes a distinctive and original intervention in post-unification German literature. Unlike Adelson's Cartesian approach to narrative, my textual analyses will be informed by Deleuze and Guattari's understanding of 'minor literature', as elaborated in their 1975 book on Kafka, and by Deleuze's philosophy of immanence more generally. Specifically I shall explore their deterritorialisation of language, their reconfigurations of German cultural memory, and their evocation of an as yet unimagined German future, which incorporates Islamic as well as Judeo-Christian traditions. I will pay close attention to Turkish linguistic, historical and cultural contexts, and to the global implications of apparently local narratives. Viewing minor literature as a much more than just 'literary' phenomenon, my interest is in how these writers are expanding Germany's cultural horizons towards the East, not in a gesture of 'diasporic pathos', but with anticipatory orientation, as they engage with key issues of the present, such as global migration, the Middle East crisis and the ongoing war on terror. At a time when widespread fear of difference is set to undermine the achievements of multiculturalism, the imaginative labour of minority writers in envisaging new kinds of community has never been so important. Yet the potentil impact of their writing is limited by reading strategies which situate them ineluctably as representative of a diasporic community, instead of productive of new directions and energies in German culture as a whole.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/G007594/1","grantId":"AH/G007594/1","fundValue":"36930","fundStart":"2009-09-21","fundEnd":"2010-01-20","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Margaret  Littler","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
