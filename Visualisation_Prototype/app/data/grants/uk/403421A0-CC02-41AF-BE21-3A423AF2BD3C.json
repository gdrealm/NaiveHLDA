In order to make new discoveries we must also develop the scanners and the chemistry we do, and as we develop our tools we use these to help us understand better what is happening when we have problems with our brains. Our work will help develop new treatments and medicines which we hope will enable us to treat brain injuries and diseases more effectively.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0600986","grantId":"G0600986","fundValue":"1342530","fundStart":"2007-02-01","fundEnd":"2012-07-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"John Douglas Pickard","coPersons":["Keri  Carpenter","Jonathan  Gillard","David Krishna Menon","Jonathan Peter Coles","Guy Barnett Williams","Peter John Hutchinson","Thomas Adrian Carpenter","Franklin Imo Aigbirhio","Tim  Fryer"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
