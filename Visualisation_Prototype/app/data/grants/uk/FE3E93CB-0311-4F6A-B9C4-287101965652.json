Bacteria are single celled organisms that live in the natural environment as part of a complex multicellular community called a biofilm. In a biofilm bacteria adhere to a surface and coat themselves in a protective layer of sugars and proteins. Common examples of where biofilms can be found include teeth, in the form of dental plaque, heart valves in the form of a chronic infection, and in the gut as part of the beneficial bacterial community that helps with food digestion. Life in a biofilm gives individual bacteria advantages that they would not have if they lived in isolation. This makes bacteria living in biofilm communities are difficult to eradicate as they are highly resistant to many antibiotics and antimicrobial agents such as bleach. It appears that bacteria living in a biofilm 'club' together and protect each other. My laboratory is interested in understanding how bacteria coordinate their activity to allow bacteria to communicate and come together to form a biofilm. Information about this process will help us understand the mechanisms that bacteria use to associate together in a biofilm community and therefore may allow the development of novel approaches to treat biofilm related infections. We study the process of biofilm formation using a soil bacterium called Bacillus subtilis. This bacterium is commonly used in the laboratory as a model to understand basic processes regarding gene regulation and expression. The information derived from such studies can be applied to other bacteria associated with human infections. In our study we plan to investigate how the flagellum (the machinery that allows the bacterium to swim) controls the behaviour of the individual bacterial cells.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/H002340/1","grantId":"BB/H002340/1","fundValue":"361016","fundStart":"2010-04-12","fundEnd":"2013-04-11","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Nicola  Stanley-Wall","coPersons":["Jason R Swedlow"],"organisation":"University of Dundee","findingsText":" The goal of this project was to investigate whether the bacterial flagellum controlled gene expression. Using a combination of genetic, biochemical and phenotypic experimental approaches we demonstrated that for the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis this was indeed the case. Through this work we have shown that the cell is capable of detecting signals from outside the cell and transmitting them to the cytoplasm to control gene expression. In this context the flagellum functions as a mechanosensor. Importantly these data highlight that the bacterial cell has a regulatory system capable of detecting whether or not the flagellum is rotating. Impedance of flagellar rotation could conceivably occur when a cell approaches a surface and starts to form biofilm - a community of microbial cells encase in a self-produced matrix and adherent to a surface. At a surface there would be a physical barrier to impede flagellar rotation. Our data help to address the question of how bacteria are able to sense when they are on a surface and stimulate expression of the genes essential for biofilm matrix production. Given the conserved nature of the flagellum from a wide-range of bacterial species these findings are likely to have implications during biofilm formation in both pathogenic and non-pathogenic settings.
