{"id":"A15E5CE8-CAAB-48B8-9E8C-FA54F58E1F45","title":"NCRI South of England Prostate Cancer Collaborative: Infrastructure Renewal","abstractText":"Following a review carried out on prostate cancer by the Cancer Research Funders Forum in 2000 major funding bodies including Cancer Research UK, the MRC and The Department of Health joined forces to injected new funds into prostate cancer research, in recognition that research on this common cancer was grossly under-funded. Two Prostate Cancer Research Collaboratives (PCCs) headed by Professor Colin Cooper and Professor David Neal were set up in 2001. The vision for the two PCCs has been to use these funds to (1) support competitive programmes of translational science to enable them to become self-sustaining; (2) to establish programmes for training young people in prostate cancer research; (3) to provide pump-priming funding for innovative projects; and (4) to provide infra-structure to develop a well-characterised bio-repository for prostate cancer research to support the science. As a result of this initiative the PCCs have created an internationally competitive prostate cancer community within the UK that did not exist prior to the setting up of the PCCs. This application is a request for two years of NCRI funding to support PCC infrastructure, including bio-repositories and databases, that underpins this initiative.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0802851","grantId":"G0802851","fundValue":"300699","fundStart":"2009-09-01","fundEnd":"2011-08-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Colin Stephen  Cooper","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Institute of Cancer Research","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
