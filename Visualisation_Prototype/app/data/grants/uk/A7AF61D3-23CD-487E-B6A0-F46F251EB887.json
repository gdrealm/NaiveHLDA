This project will study a particular cell type, the eosinophil, which appears to be capable of either curing the individual of disease or of causing harmful tissue reactions. Millions of people and animals in the world are infected by parasitic nematode worms. These parasites occupy a multitude of different sites within the body, from the gut to the skin or blood. The damage that worms cause varies between different parasite species and also between different infected individuals. Some individuals are relatively resistant to infection with worms, while others, are particularly susceptible. Resistance to parasitic nematode disease depends on the immune responses that the body develops to fight these infections. Interestingly, in many infections, although a specific type of immune response can kill parasitic worms, that particular immune response may also be guilty of damaging the tissues of the host organism. Therefore in areas of the world where individuals are continually at risk of infection with parasitic worms, the immune response can be viewed as a finely/balanced see-saw that rocks between the ability to kill parasites and the ability of the response to cause harm. As researchers, we wish to find out the triggers that push the see-saw in one direction or the other and the controls that the body puts in place to prevent the balance from being biased too strongly in one or other direction. We have identified a particular cell-type, the eosinophil, that appears to be important in parasite-killing but when over-active it is also involved in tissue damage. Our aim in this research is to definitively establish, once and for all, that this cell type, the eosinophil, is capable of killing parasites and of damaging tissues. We will then establish the biological factors that are produced by eosinophils in both of these situations to try and define whether there are differences between esoinophils that kill parasites and those that cause damage. Lastly we will try to identify particular immune responses that limit the damage caused by eosinophils. This work is particularly exciting because it is only recently that scientists have developed the technological tools that will help us to identify the role played by eosinophils. In addition, immune responses to parasitic worms are remarkably similar to the immune responses that cause asthma, therefore the results of our studies will be useful both for fighting infections with worms and for fighting the symptoms of asthma.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D013550/1","grantId":"BB/D013550/1","fundValue":"300786","fundStart":"2006-09-01","fundEnd":"2009-08-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Our findings have added to the body of information of how type 2 responses drive eosinophilia and how eosinophilia is regulated. There is currently a high level of interest in the axis of regulation of eosinophilia as eosinophils have been noted to be necessary for driving alternatively activated macrophages and these macrophages are essential in the maintenance of leanness and avoidance of obesity. Thus as obesity is one important factor in primary health care and health economy of the UK at the moment our basic studies on the biology of eosinophils and their regulation add to the pool of knowledge needed to drive immune responses associated with maintenance of leanness. Eosinophils are also a crucial component of the pathogenesis of allergic disease thus results obtained in this study are used by researchers and clinicians working in this area as well as the area of parasitic infection and the results are important in the regulation and subsequent treatment of allergic disease. Recent trials for the use of eosinophil blockers in the therapeutic control of allergy have been informed by these studies. In addition the results have been widely disseminated by publication and presentation at international meetings.

This project studied a particular cell type, the eosinophil, which appears to be capable of both curing the individual of disease and of causing harmful tissue reactions. By using mice specifically deficient in eosinophils, we have definitively established that these cells are indeed necessary for protection against a tissue-dwelling parasitic nematode, in a primary infection but not in a secondary infection. These results confirmed the implications of our previous work in mice that were unable to recruit eosinophils to the site of infection. Additionally we have shown that eosinophils are an important component of pathology seen in the lungs of parasite-infected mice from both primary and secondary infections. When we used mice that are deficient for a granule protein found in eosinophils, eosinophil peroxidase (EPO), we found that this granule protein is itself crucial for parasite clearance during primary but not secondary infection. Interestingly lack of the same granule protein, EPO, lead to lower infiltration of airways by eosinophils suggesting that this protein may self-regulate the recruitment of eosinophils. Importantly absence of EPO, also lead to reduced pathology in the lungs suggesting that this eosinophilic granule protein is also a critical component of lung function pathology. These findings were specific to EPO, as our experiments in mice lacking another eosinophil granule protein, major basic protein, did not show differences in either parasite clearance or in parasite-induced lung pathology. These results show that eosinophils are an essential component for both protection and pathology and that the granule protein eosinophil peroxidase is critical in carrying out these functions. \n\nWe also investigated the cell-types that may regulate eosinophilia by depleting either B cells or T regulatory cells or alternatively activated macrophages (aamp). These results suggested that to different extents both T regulatory cells and aamp regulate the level of parasite killing, eosinophilia, and lung pathology. Removal of macrophages decreased parasite killing, decreased lung function in both primary and secondary infection, and significantly increased a number of other measures of pathology such as goblet cell hyperplasia. Removal of T regulatory cells, although not significantly altering parasite levels, did lower lung function and increase lung pathology during primary infection which may have resulted from an increased eosinophilic infiltration into the lung.\n\nIn collaborative work we also found that eosinophils are advantageous for parasite fecundity, thus confounding their role in protection in an unexpected way.\n\nThus, overall the eosinophil plays both a protective and a pathological role and the granule protein eosinophil peroxidase appears integral in both functions. Our results suggest that eosinophil-induced protection and pathology may be regulated by more than one cell type. Defining whether eosinophil function can be differentially regulated presents a challenge for the future. Eosinophil regulation of alternatively activated macrophages is now established and this is beginning to be understood as a crucial pathway in avoidance of obesity. Our results have shown the some of the ways in which eosinophils can be induced, and regulated and also the potential for eosinophils and their products to be pathogenic if in abundance.
