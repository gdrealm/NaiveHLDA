Currently gas chromatography, mass spectrometry (GC/MS) or electrochemical sensors cannot offer these combined attributes. Real-time air-quality measurements, lower troposphere urban chemistry studies (pollutant pathways), anthropogenic and biogenic emission measurements, flux exchange monitoring, to name only a few, are areas that would benefit greatly from the development of ultra-high sensitivity sensors, suitable for field deployment and operating with high temporal resolution. In this application we propose to demonstrate a novel approach to address these aspirations, which is ground-breaking in the field of ultra-high sensitivity laser based sensors for in-situ monitoring and laboratory studies. The concept exploits aspects of tuneable laser absorption spectroscopy (LAS) with several combined advantages: mid infrared operation targeting intense fundamental ro-vibrational absorption bands, cavity type spectroscopy providing extremely long equivalent absorber path lengths, wide frequency tuneability for multispecies and/or broadband absorber monitoring and compactness and robustness for field deployment. We propose here to develop and demonstrate this novel concept for ultra-trace species monitoring and bring the technology from TRL1 to TRL3.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/H002014/1","grantId":"NE/H002014/1","fundValue":"178202","fundStart":"2010-05-01","fundEnd":"2012-03-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Damien  Weidmann","coPersons":[],"organisation":"STFC - Laboratories","findingsText":" The project has successful demonstrated the physical principle of a mid infrared laser sensor that combines the advantages of 1) broad tunability (~100cm-1), through the use of a quantum cascade laser (QCL) in an external cavity (EC) configuration, 2) enhanced sensitivity (few hundredfold), and 3) a very compact package. Specifically this project has achieved the following:\n\n1. The physical modelling of an external cavity QCL and its use to determine the specification of each component involved in the system. \n\n2. The optical design and implementation of a bench-top EC-QCL source demonstrating an overall frequency tuning range of ~100 cm-1. \n\n3. The development of custom-designed anti-reflection coatings suitable for broadband QCL and the subsequent processing of devices.\n\n4. The study of the EC-QCL source in a novel configuration that demonstrated a sensitivity enhancement in the detection of gaseous samples.\n\n5. The clear demonstration of the sensitivity enhancement through the spectroscopy of two test broadband absorbers: dimethyl carbonate and pentafluoroethane.\n\n6. The understanding and physical modelling of the sensitivity enhancement and the investigation of data reduction to measure sample concentrations with the constraints of practical gas sensors in mind. In addition, sensitivity estimates have been determined for this kind of gas sensor. The instrument concept that has been demonstrated aims to provide a real time, high sensitivity, and compact in-situ sensor targeting multiple broadband absorbers.\n\nThis is of relevance to many users. For example chemical or oil industries, car makers, environmental monitoring sector.\n A patent describing the approach and the system developed has been submitted. \n\nFunding for further development is actively sought as well as industrial partners.
