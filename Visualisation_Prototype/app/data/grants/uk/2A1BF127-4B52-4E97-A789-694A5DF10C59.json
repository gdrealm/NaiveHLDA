Recognition of this resulted in funders of flood risk management in the UK pooling resources to jointly fund the Flood Risk Management Research Consortium (FRMRC), from 2004 until 2012. The consortium was charged with establishing a programme of high quality science to enhance understanding of flooding and improve society's ability to reduce flood risk. This initiative enabled the agencies responsible for FCERM in the UK to actively engage with the university research community in a manner that facilitated the successful uptake of improved scientific and engineering techniques in support of flood risk management practice. In anticipation of the end of FRMRC the Living with Environmental Change (LWEC) Partnership developed and published its UK Flood and Coastal Erosion Risk Management Strategy in 2011. To provide investment in this strategy the EPSRC held an &quot;Innovative Solutions to Flood Risk&quot; sandpit. The outcome of which was the award of three new grants supporting innovation in flood risk management. The purpose of the Flood and Coastal Erosion Risk Management Network (FCERM_Net) is to support the LWEC strategy by providing a co-ordinating activity for the EPSRC investment through the facilitation of interaction between the research and user communities to aid the translation and uptake of the research, identifying emerging research gaps and encouraging the development of new research proposals to bridge these gaps.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/L000180/1","grantId":"EP/L000180/1","fundValue":"157582","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2016-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Gareth  Pender","coPersons":["S  Arthur","Heather  Haynes"],"organisation":"Heriot-Watt University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
