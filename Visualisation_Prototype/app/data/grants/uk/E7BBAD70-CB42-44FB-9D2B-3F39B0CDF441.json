In absence of a cure, an effective vaccine would be the most sustainable way to prevent new HIV infections. We propose to make the most of what we have learned from a series of previous vaccine trials to design and test an HIV vaccine strategy which we believe will trigger a better immune response than those observed so far and potentially lead to the identification of a successful vaccine and vaccine strategy.\n\nThe proposal brings together the scientific expertise and a range of vaccine products that are designed around a common HIV virus found predominantly in Southern and East Africa, India and Nepal and which has caused the world s worst HIV epidemics and is responsible for around half of all infections. The study will be conducted in collaboration with the UK HIV Vaccines Consortium (UK HVC) whose mission is to generate a series of candidate vaccines containing similar HIV antigens, such that direct comparison can be achieved to understand most rapidly the most immunogenic strategy for immunization in man.\n\nThe design of the UK HVC 001DMP trial is based on an immunisation regimen similar to that used in the only HIV vaccine trial to demonstrate partial efficacy (RV144, which showed a 31% reduction in HIV infection in Thailand). The study will explore both the safety and immunogenicity of this novel combination of HIV vaccine candidates and will formally explore the immunological impact of a prime, boost and re-boost strategy using different vaccine candidates provided by the UK HVC. It will also explore the effectiveness of combining vaccines candidate together with the added advantage of minimising the length of the regimen seen as crucial to vaccine feasibility.\n\nA successful and safe HIV vaccine would have considerable benefits across the general populations and high risk groups. It could have the potential to prevent over 70 million infections over the course of 15 years. Should the trial identify promising vaccine constructs or strategies, the research would support the design of the next clinical studies and provide an opportunity to inform and support decisions and policy making in several areas of HIV prevention.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1001784","grantId":"G1001784","fundValue":"822975","fundStart":"2012-07-01","fundEnd":"2014-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Jonathan N Weber","coPersons":["Sheena  McCormack","Jill  Gilmour","Sarah  Joseph","Robin J Shattock"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
