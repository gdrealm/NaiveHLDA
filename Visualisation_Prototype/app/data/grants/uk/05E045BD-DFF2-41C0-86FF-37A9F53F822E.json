{"id":"05E045BD-DFF2-41C0-86FF-37A9F53F822E","title":"Stress online: Developing a reliable and valid interactive online method for measuring stressful life events and difficulties.","abstractText":"<p>Stress is a major contributor to illness. It has both objective properties (adverse life events and difficulties) and subjective responses (physical or emotional illness). Objective stressors include unemployment, housing or finance events, as well as&nbsp; inter-personal events for example in partner or parenting roles. Personal context is key to understanding the harmful impacts on health. These latter are psychological (eg depression), or physical (eg cardiovascular disease). A new approach, Computerised Life Assessment Record (CLEAR), using latest online digital technology will be designed to mimic the existing ‘gold standard’ Life Events and Difficulties Schedule to enable a more cost effective measurement approach.</p>\n\n<p>CLEAR will be tested and delivered online using latest web-based data capture technology. Reliability and validity of the CLEAR instrument will be determined and its association with health outcomes in an existing Depression and Case Control sample (DeCC n=250), and new first year undergraduate students (n=125). Analysis will confirm the comparability of 30 online CLEAR versus LEDS interviews, test CLEAR response stability over time and test stressful events in relation to depression, physical illness and student academic performance.&nbsp; An International Scientific Advisory Board will ensure use of the tool in existing longitudinal health research studies and practice.<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K00638X/1","grantId":"ES/K00638X/1","fundValue":"385265","fundStart":"2014-01-20","fundEnd":"2017-01-19","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Antonia  Bifulco","coPersons":["Matthew John Taylor","Helen  Fisher","Anne  Farmer","Georgina Mayling Hosang"],"organisation":"Middlesex University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
