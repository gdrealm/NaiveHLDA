Furthermore, factors that may be associated with differences in families' productive efficiencies can be explored within this framework. Amongst these possible factors, the relationship between parental aspirations and the child's expectations and the relative efficiency of the family when producing these dual education outputs will be explored.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F041691/1","grantId":"ES/F041691/1","fundValue":"38038","fundStart":"2008-07-01","fundEnd":"2008-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Karen Ann Mumford","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of York","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
