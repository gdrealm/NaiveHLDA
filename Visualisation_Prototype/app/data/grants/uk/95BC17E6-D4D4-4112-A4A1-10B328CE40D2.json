{"id":"95BC17E6-D4D4-4112-A4A1-10B328CE40D2","title":"SpACE-Net - The Spatial Audio Creative Engineering Network","abstractText":"Spatial audio research is concerned with the presentation of music and audio material to an audience in a manner that is optimized according to the spatial properties of the human hearing system. Ultimately this work seeks to rise to the challenge of synthesizing a complex three-dimensional acoustic world that is indistinguishable from what we normally hear around us.Work in this area has reached a point where multichannel delivery systems are finally becoming accepted in the domestic environment, predominantly through applications in the entertainment industry such as DVD, home-theatre systems and multimedia computing technology. These recent developments therefore precipitate the need to identify future directions for research in this increasingly demanding area.UK spatial audio research is currently small although there are a number of unique areas that ensure visibility in the wider international community. The proposed network aims to build on this current work to create a community of researchers, practitioners and artists, drawn from the fields of science, audio engineering and the arts. It is anticipated that through this network and the interface between theoretical, experimental and creative approaches, the effective coordination of these researchers and practitioners will lead to the identification, articulation and development of important directions in future spatial audio work.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=GR/T21387/01","grantId":"GR/T21387/01","fundValue":"42946","fundStart":"2006-01-16","fundEnd":"2008-07-15","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Damian  Murphy","coPersons":["Tim  Brookes"],"organisation":"University of York","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
