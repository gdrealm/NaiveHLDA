Immigrant/Minority Conditions and Policy Options in France and Britain","abstractText":"<p>In France and Britain, two purportedly opposing visions of immigrant integration - one based on universalism and citizenship verses one centred on anti-discrimination and multiculturalism seem to have produced common outcomes, or failures, indicated by equally poor socio-ecomonic and political conditions among ethnic minorities. </p>\n\n<p>This set of workshops will interrograte the French and British models, outcomes, and policy options surrounding immigrant/ethnic minority integration. Participants will include academics, policy makers, local government representatives and NGOs (including migrant/ethnic minority associations). Workshop reports will be widely disseminated, and a research project proposal will be developed to explicate common and differential challenges of integration policy formation.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-170-25-0011","grantId":"RES-170-25-0011","fundValue":"13455","fundStart":"2006-11-01","fundEnd":"2007-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Steven  Vertovec","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
