{"id":"78649C0F-DF64-4BED-BFF4-F93232932CB2","title":"The Bainouk corpus: a first documentation of the Gunyaamolo variety of Bainouk (Atlantic, Casamance, Senegal)","abstractText":"The project consists of the compilation of a first electronic corpus containing unique primary speech data of the highly endangered Atlantic language Bainouk Gunyaamolo, and a first step towards its documentation. With about 6,000 speakers in a decreasing number of villages in the Casamance region of Senegal and in neighbouring Guinea Bissau, Bainouk Gunyaamolo (Baynunk, Banyun) is a highly endangered language. \\n\\nThe corpus, archived and disseminated in different places, will constitute the first record of a Bainouk variety and will be an invaluable digital resource for both the academic community and those members of the speech community living in the diaspora. Given that the descriptive knowledge of Atlantic languages is sparse, and that their exact genealogical affiliations and internal subgroupings are a matter of debate, the corpus is deemed highly relevant to widen the empirical database for future investigations in the areas of descriptive and documentary linguistics, linguistic typology, contact linguistics, and historical-comparative linguistics. In addition, it will be a unique repository of Bainouk linguistic practices relevant for a wider audience, including the fields of cultural anthropology and oral history, but also encompassing the speech community and the general public.The grammatical sketch and lexicon accompanying it will systematise the descriptive knowledge achieved by the end of the project.\\n\\nLanguage contact has been claimed to have played a role in typlogically highly unusual features of Bainouk, such as productive alliterative concord through copying of the first syllable of the nominal root onto dependent elements, even for nouns without a noun class prefix. According to Sauvageot (1967), these prefixless nouns constitute around 30% of the nominal lexicon and are allegedly loan words, In the absence of substantial diachronic sources, an appraisal of the sociolinguistic side of language contact will enable a better appraisal of its structural outcomes.\\n\\nTo this purpose, a sociolinguistic study on the linguistic profiles of Bainouk speakers will be undertaken. The Casamance is an area of great linguistic and cultural convergence. For centuries, Bainouk communities have received and accommodated incomers from Mande- and Joola-speaking groups, notably speakers of the Mande language Mandinka and speakers of the Joola varieties Fogny and Kasa. Bainouk communities have been bilingual in Mandinka or a Joola variety for such a long time that bilingualism is an integral part of their cultural and linguistic identity and has left important structural imprints on their language. Following new economic and linguistic pressures, they are now giving up their established bilingualism and add other Joola varieties and Creole, as well as the national language Wolof and the official language French to their linguistic repertoires, resulting in Bainouk speakers using between three and six language, often on a daily basis. Therefore, an understanding of the overlapping and complementary repertoires in the different languages is deemed extremely relevant for a documentation of representative registers and genres in Bainouk, for an understanding of its endangerment situation, and for an appreciation of the structural outcomes of such a prolonged, intense and multilingual contact situation. The sociolinguistic study will achieve such a first understanding of the complex extralinguistic factors governing multilingual language use in the Bainouk community. \\n\\nTaken together, the corpus and description on the one hand and the sociolinguistic study on the other hand will represent an important contribution to different fields of linguistics and an invaluable resource for future research on the linguistic structure and sociolinguistic situation of Bainouk and their interaction.\\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/G008949/1","grantId":"AH/G008949/1","fundValue":"21608","fundStart":"2008-09-29","fundEnd":"2008-12-28","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Friederike  Luepke","coPersons":[],"organisation":"School of Oriental & African Studies","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
