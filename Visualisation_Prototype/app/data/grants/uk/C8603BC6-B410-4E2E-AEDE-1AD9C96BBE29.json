Schools have to balance the need to\nintegrate children into the classroom and the curriculum with the need to develop language\nacquisition as quickly as possible. The research discussed in this report illustrates that schools\nhave developed different strategies for addressing these issues. Some have developed specific\nprogrammes for induction and specialised language support. Others tend to rely on a\ncombination of small group work supported by teaching assistants and strategies developed by\nteachers in the classroom. All of these strategies have implications for resources which are\nalready overstretched between competing priorities. There was also a marked difference in the\nsupport given by local authorities. In some cases the local authority provides regular support,\ninformation and advice, while in other cases teachers were not sure where to access the necessary\ninformation and tools to support their work.\nMany of the interviews with both teachers and parents reinforced the stereotype of Polish\nchildren as clever, hard working and diligent. This image simplifies a far more complex reality.\nNot all were able to achieve as highly as their parents expectations, and we also found some\nevidence of special educational needs among newly arrived Polish children. Moreover, the\nprocess of language acquisition is complicated and it takes longer to achieve higher level\nlinguistic skills than many may expect. While several parents were quite critical of the British\neducational system, there was nonetheless an expectation that teachers would help Polish\nchildren (who often arrived with no English at all) to achieve language fluency in a very short\nperiod. Some parents, however, were appreciative of the enormous efforts being made by the\nschools to welcome and facilitate new migrants.\nOur study suggested that there were a number of areas in which the expectations and\nunderstandings of teachers and parents conflicted and that this could lead to frustration which\nimpacted on relationships between parents and schools All the parents we spoke to were very\ninterested in their children's education and sought to be directly involved through helping with\nhomework and having regular updates on their progress. Several were highly critical about the\nlack of regular feedback from teachers. Although most teachers we interviewed praised Polish\nparents for their work ethic and commitment to education, most appeared unaware of the\nresentment of parents at what they perceived as inadequate information about their children's\nprogress. The research raised a number of issues and concerns and suggested policy responses for various\nlevels, from classroom teachers to national. Some of these would be good practice for any group\nof children and parents, whether English speaking or not, since good EAL teaching is good\npractice in general. While some would therefore mainly affect Polish children, in many cases we\nsuggest they could be generalised for other groups. Moreover, the better inclusion of Polish\nchildren would improve the experience of schools for all, both teachers and parents.\n1. Spreading good practice and knowledge\nThe research identified many examples of good practice and of appropriate resources in\nindividual authorities or schools. There was, however, a lack of awareness of these strategies and\nresources by many teachers. There is a need to spread this knowledge at all levels - within\nschools, local authorities, and at national and European Union level.\nLocal authorities have a key role to play in disseminating information, training, resources and\nskills. They may also need to focus on monitoring and supporting the achievement of Polish\nchildren across the borough. This clearly has implications for resources. It requires time for\nteachers to spend outside the classroom, for example in visiting other schools and attending\ntraining and meetings. It is also important that the EMA coordinators for individual schools are\nfreed up from full time classroom responsibility in order to manage this role effectively.\n2. Reflecting on practice\nThe parents' interviews raised concerns about too rigid and early streaming of children and low\nexpectations of those considered to be 'low achievers'. These concerns need careful\nconsideration in relation to teaching practice and classroom management as a whole.\n3. Teaching Resources\nThe availability of resources was sporadic and more could be done by schools and LEAs to\npromote information about available materials to support those teaching Polish children. These\nwould include both Polish language and bi-lingual resources and material on EAL teaching and\non the experience of Polish children.\nPolish language resources\nTeachers found dictionaries and bi-lingual texts useful. Particular gaps were identified in relation\nto the needs of children attempting to access the curriculum. This reflected the difficulty of\nprogressing from everyday or 'playground' language to more technical language. Schools and\nlocal authorities might consider developing the following resources:\n? Dictionaries which cover the topics in the school curriculum\n? Dual language texts which cover curriculum related material\n? Dual language stories at a higher level\n? Banks of vocabulary which would allow class teachers to communicate particular\ntechnical words\n? Tests available in Polish in order to speed up the process of testing children's\nability and identifying special needs\n4. Staffing\nStaff identified the need for training on language acquisition for classroom teachers, particularly\nto help them move children from basic to higher level. This might include a greater emphasis on\ngrammatical structure.40\nStaff also need information on the background of Polish children, and particularly the\ndifferences in the educational system. This may also be facilitated by projects such as establishing\nlinks with Polish schools through exchanges.\nPolish speaking staff\nPolish speaking staff played a vital role in all the schools in the study. Schools should consider\nrecruiting Polish-speaking staff at all levels. There is, however, a danger of relying too heavily on\nteaching assistants, who are both low paid and often over-worked as well as often having limited\nqualifications. Training opportunities for this group are essential.\n5. Engagement with parents\nThis can be facilitated by both written and face to face communication and through\nwritten and internet resources, for example:\n? A bank of resources in dual language which could be adapted for particular\ncircumstances and available electronically and as a web resource. These could include\nschool newsletters, school information packs, standard letters for example consent forms\nfor school trips. Placing the text side by side could encourage parents and children to\nimprove English skills.\n? Information about the British school system and organisation and expectations of\nparents in relation to e.g. attendance, uniform, homework. This could be provided at\ninduction meeting and reviewed through discussion with parents and staff.\n? Meetings for Polish (and where appropriate other groups) parents on specific topics to\ndevelop more effective communication and dispel misunderstandings. One example\ncould be the method of teaching maths in British schools\n? Parents could be encouraged to become involved with the school through for example:\no Helping with translation and interpretation\no Involvement in wider school activities - multicultural evenings, fairs\nProvision of space for parents' meetings and special activities - e.g. information and\nadvice sessions, English language classes, could be considered.\n6. Improving the information available to parents considering migration\nPolish authorities could be encouraged to be more active in the distribution of information about\nthe British school system in Poland to those considering migration.\n\nAs part of this project we developed a Guide to the Uk Educational System for Polish parents (also translated into Polish) which included some helpful comparisons between the UK and Polish educational systems which will be useful to both Polish families and also to British schools. Thsi Guide was widely disseminated.\nAs a result of this work we were approached by another community organisation (Action for Integration) which works with refugee families. They commissioned us to do another version of our Guide aimed at wider refugee and newly arrived migrant groups (not just Poles). This is an important impact from our original Polish study and shows how the results of our work have had wider benefits across other groups.
