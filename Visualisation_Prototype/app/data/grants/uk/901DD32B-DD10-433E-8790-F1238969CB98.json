{"id":"901DD32B-DD10-433E-8790-F1238969CB98","title":"LEMMA 3: Longitudinal Effects, Multilevel Modelling and Applications","abstractText":"<p>Social science is all about understanding complex social processes. For example, the processes by which people from families with differing socio-economic status obtain markedly different life outcomes are complex and develop over time. It has long been recognised that understanding such processes requires longitudinal data comprising repeated measurements of the key factors over time, and there has been substantial investment in the collection of such data. <br /><br />The overarching objective of LEMMA 3 is to build capacity in the analysis of longitudinal data. It aims to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>Review and synthesise important developments in longitudinal data analysis.</li>\n\n <li>Develop and adapt new methodology that addresses important problems in social research today.</li>\n\n <li>Apply the newly developed methods to substantive research projects in collaboration with experts from medical sociology, health psychology, economics, education and developmental psychology.</li>\n\n <li>Implement the methodological research in the user-friendly e-STAT software environment. e-STAT has been developed to overcome one of the biggest barriers facing social researchers, namely, learning to use statistical software packages.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>LEMMA 3 also runs an extensive programme of training and capacity building activities for academic and non-academic users. Additionally, it provides support to other trainers who wish to develop their own courses in longitudinal data analysis. These activities are augmented by further developing online training materials (including the LEMMA online course) and continuing to make available free software to UK-based academic users.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-576-25-0032","grantId":"RES-576-25-0032","fundValue":"1120420","fundStart":"2011-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Fiona Alison Steele","coPersons":["Kelvyn  Jones","Frank  Windmeijer","William John Browne","Harvey  Goldstein","George  Leckie","Christopher Michael Charlton","Paul Simon Clarke"],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":" Not required until 3 months after end of award.
