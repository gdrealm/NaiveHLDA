There are now a number of drugs which inhibit the virus but it can develop resistance to all of them. Combination therapy is the best and ideally drugs should block different stages of the virus life cycle. Finding new targets is vital. The virus packages its genetic material by allowing the genes which are in the form of RNA to fold into a special structure which distinguishes them from other RNAs in the cell. This structure is called a ‘packaging signal’. We have been studying this structure and that of related viruses for several years. We plan to analyse this RNA structure further and to work out where in the cell the recognition process is occurring. We can then design agents to bind to the RNA in the critical region and block packaging of the genes into the virus. This will be a new drug target. If we block the genes entering the virus then an infected cell will release only protein containing, non infectious, virus-like particles which will boost the immune response in the patient.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G9805564","grantId":"G9805564","fundValue":"1532860","fundStart":"1999-07-01","fundEnd":"2009-02-28","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Andrew Michael Lever","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
