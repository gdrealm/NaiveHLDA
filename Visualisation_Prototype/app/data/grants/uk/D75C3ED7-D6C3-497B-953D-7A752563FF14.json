However, conventional techniques lack both resolution (pixel size 0.6 mm) and contrast when standard MRI pulse sequences are used. It is possible to increase the resolution of the images by placing a receiver probe close to the part under study to maximise signal and reduce noise from that region. We have previously developed an endovaginal receiver for use at 1.5T and shown significant improvement in resolution. However contrast between tumour and non-tumour tissue remains low and requires use of specialist sequences such as diffusion-weighted images which are inherently low on signal-to-noise ratio. Production of an endovaginal coil for use at a higher field strength (3.0T) would enable use of higher resolution diffusion-weighted imaging. We propose therefore to build an endovaginal device for use at 3.0T, optimize the diffusion-weighted imaging and compare the accuracy of conventional MRI techniques with and without the addition of diffusion-weighted imaging for detecting early stage cervical cancer by comparing with the tissue findings at surgery.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0802470","grantId":"G0802470","fundValue":"162552","fundStart":"2009-10-01","fundEnd":"2012-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Nandita  DeSouza","coPersons":["Ayoma  Attygalle","Thomas  Ind","Maria A.
