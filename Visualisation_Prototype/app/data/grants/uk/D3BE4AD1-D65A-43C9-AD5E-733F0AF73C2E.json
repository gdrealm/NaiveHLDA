{"id":"D3BE4AD1-D65A-43C9-AD5E-733F0AF73C2E","title":"Policy and Practice for Environmental Change","abstractText":"<p>The Rural Economy and Land Use (Relu) Programme is an unprecedented collaboration between ESRC, BBSRC and NERC. Running 2003-13 it has had a budget of &pound;24 million, with additional funding from Scottish Government and Defra. Relu's aim is to provide evidence, supported by inter-disciplinary research, that can be used to inform policy and practice, and the programme has considerable relevance, not only for rural land use. It has been a radical experiment in project and programme management and capacity building for interdisciplinarity and knowledge exchange, involving three research councils, 85 projects (each involving social and natural scientists), 50 research institutions, 500 researchers, 40 disciplines and over 4000 stakeholders engaged extensively in framing, conduct and dissemination of the research. External interest in the programme has always been strong and enthusiasm for learning lessons from the programme continues.</p>\n\n<p>This one year extension to the Director's Office is to further realise the impact of the research on policy and practice and to inform research and knowledge exchange policy and emerging Research Council programmes (such as Living with Environmental Change and Global Food Security). Planned communication activities include synthesised publications extracting the policy and practice implications of Relu research.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J009113/1","grantId":"ES/J009113/1","fundValue":"293811","fundStart":"2012-04-01","fundEnd":"2016-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Philip  LoweJeremy  Phillipson","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
