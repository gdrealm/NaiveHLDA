But what should sociologists make of recent biological research that changes our understanding of the kinds of creatures that human beings are? We now know a lot about the biological possibilities that shape human lives - and, especially, via the neurosciences, about mental health problems that can alter those lives. But we also know that neurobiology is fashioned by the body’s environments, by social relations, culture, and daily life. This suggests a transformative moment in the relationship between the social and biological sciences - or, following Carl Woese’s proposal for biology,'a new sociology for a new century.'</p>\n\n<p>The project focuses on ‘urbanicity’: the relationship between the social and neurological life of urban citizens, with particular attention to mental health. This is an historical interest in the social sciences, also now receiving particular attention in the neurobiological and psychiatric sciences. The project connects these interests through two methods:</p>\n\n<ol>\n \n\n <li>through conceptual and historical investigation, it clarifies, and ‘re-vitalises’ their historical relationship</li>\n\n <li>it brings neuroscientists and sociologists together in two workshops, creating a shared protocol for future research that can think both sociologically and neurologically about wellbeing and the city.</li>\n\n</ol>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L003074/1","grantId":"ES/L003074/1","fundValue":"194777","fundStart":"2013-09-01","fundEnd":"2015-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  This grant is part-way through, with key findings to emerge in the latter phase, so there is as yet no usage to report. \n\nHowever, we anticipate that at the end of the grant, and in the period, that follows, the shared biological-neurobiological programme of research on urban stress that we are working to put together will be of use to mental health experts including clinicians and service planners; urban planners and policymakers including local authorities; and governmental and non-governmental organisations interested in questions of urban equality, and democracy.\n\nWe also anticipate the direct findings of this grant (on, for example, the connections between sociological and neurobiological work) to be used by scholars in the social, neuroscientific, and psychiatric sciences who work on questions of urban stress and density, as well as on the social life of cities more generally.

However, while there is a great deal of neurobiological and epidemiological work on the biological markings of stressful city living, and a great deal of sociological and anthropological work on its social aspects, these two research-areas rarely talk to one another - and even more rarely still collaborate on shared projects. The goal of this grant is to begin to close this gap, so that we can better understand the stresses of urban life - especially as they produce psychological problems.\n\nThe aims of the grant are thus two-fold: first, we wish to discover whether there are any connections to be drawn between, on the one hand, sociological work (going back a century or so) that has used ethnographic and social-science methods to understand 'mental life and the city' and, on the other hand, neuroscientific work (which has really only emerged in the last decade or so) that uses the tools of functional neuroimaging to discover the biological markings of 'urban stress.' The point of seeking those connections is to assess whether these two research areas - which have many similar questions, but very different methods - might not be joined up, and become more than the sum of their parts. Second, we wish to discover if we can bring experts from these very different disciplines together, in order to formulate a research strategy for uncovering the still poorly-understood relationship between urban life and mental distress - so that we can collectively produce a much richer understanding of the conjoined social and biological forces that underpin this phenomenon. The point of putting these together is that there is now much evidence that in order to understand and intervene on the problems produced by city living, these disciplines will need to learn to work together. \n\nWe have indeed found that there are very strong connections between the history of sociological work in this area, and the more contemporary neuroscientific research. In a paper currently under review, we use historical and conceptual analysis to show: (1) that many of the ideas produced within urban sociology can be used to inform neurobiological research; and also (2) that learning to connect with biological methods can help sociologists to recover these aspects of their own disciplines, thus finding new sources of impact for sociological knowledge. \n\nWe have also found that there are questions common to sociological, epidemiological, psychiatric and neuroscientific researchers in this area - and that it is possible for these researchers to design a common project that unites their different knowledges. In a transdisciplinary workshop that we ran in September 2014 (with a follow-up to come in February 2015), researchers from these disciplines shared methods, issues and questions - showing, for example, how ethnographic work with residents of ordinary streets can help epidemiologists to get a better grasp of what people mean when they talk about stress, or how psychiatric work on the relationship between stressful environments and neurodevelopment can expand sociological work on urban inequalities. While the findings of this grant are related to the conceptual and institutional framework through which these very different research agendas might be put together, we anticipate that a shared biological-neurobiological programme of research on urban stress (which will extend beyond the lifetime of this grant) will be of use to mental health experts including clinicians and service planners; urban planners and policymakers including local authorities; and both governmental and non-governmental organisations interested in questions of urban equality, and democracy.\n\nWe anticipate the direct findings of this grant (on, for example, the connections between sociological and neurobiological work) to be of particular interest to scholars in the social, neuro, and psychiatric sciences who work on questions of urban stress and density, as well as on the social life of cities more generally. We anticipate our model of collaboration (including the historical arguments underpinning it) to be of interest to funders and research managers, as well as scholars, and others more generally, who are seeking novel and effective models of interdisciplinary collaboration.
