Mycobacteria survive and proliferate within phagocytic cells of the immune system, the macrophages, defence cells with potent antibacterial mechanisms. Immune mediators such as interferon gamma (IFN-?) activate macrophages and promote bacterial killing. IFN-? is secreted by T lymphocytes and natural killer cells upon instruction by the macrophage-derived mediators, interleukin 12 and 18 (IL-18). We recently observed that mice lacking IL-18, die much earlier of experimental tuberculosis than wild type mice. Thus, IL-18 appears to be essentially involved in promoting protective immunity against tuberculosis. Here we propose to carry out a detailed analysis of the function of IL-18 during the immune responses against tubercle bacilli in order to understand its effect on downstream immune mediators promoting protective immunity. This knowledge will guide the development of improved immune prophylactic and therapeutic measures to boost protection against tuberculosis. Our research will be published in scientific journals widely accessible to the public.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0700163","grantId":"G0700163","fundValue":"537054","fundStart":"2007-08-01","fundEnd":"2011-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Ulrich Emil Schaible","coPersons":[],"organisation":"London Sch of Hygiene and Trop Medicine","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
