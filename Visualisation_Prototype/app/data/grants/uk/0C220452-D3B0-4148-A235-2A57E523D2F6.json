The seizures are the most prominent symptom, but the underlying changes in brain structure and function lead to other, more subtle, problems that can prove difficult for people with epilepsy. One of the more common kinds of epilepsy is known as temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) after the part of the brain that starts the seizures. It can be difficult to treat because many patients with TLE do not respond to the drugs normally used to control seizures, and because parts of the brain may become damaged as a result of the repeated epileptic seizures. Experimental models are used to help develop better treatments for many conditions, including epilepsy. Here we will use a model of TLE produced by injecting a tiny amount of tetanus toxin (which is similar to Botox) into the part of the rat?s brain equivalent to that responsible for TLE in humans. We will find out: why the inhibitory systems that normally control brain activity fail even though the inhibitory cells are still present in the epileptic focus; how the wiring of the nerve cells changes; and what are the mechanisms that eventually stop seizures even though inhibition and wiring do not return to normal. These insights will provide new leads in the search for improved treatments.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0802162","grantId":"G0802162","fundValue":"608861","fundStart":"2010-04-01","fundEnd":"2013-11-14","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"John Gordon Jefferys","coPersons":["Attila  Sik"],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
