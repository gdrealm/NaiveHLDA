{"id":"3CA2FE23-B2C7-4FB0-95D0-5638B26774DC","title":"Tales of Things: Exhibition and symposium on the Internet of Social Things.","abstractText":"The creative explorations across the TOTeM project have defined the many ways of articulating the potential for a social form of an Internet of Things. Often characterised by logistical solutions for manufacturing and distribution, artistic and playful uses of the Tales of Things platform have introduced the principle that objects may be linked to the internet in a benign and accessible manner to people. Therefore it seems only appropriate to continue to use this genre to explore the broader opportunities and fears that 'ubiquity' creates.\n\nSubsequently we propose to have an exhibition and symposium showcasing the variety of work that TOTeM has been involved in and setting it within the context of wider research on the Internet of Things by other institutions and artists.\n\nAn exhibition would be held in a high profile venue such as Media City, Salford, National Galleries Scotland or The Lighthouse (Scotland's Centre for Architecture and Design) in Glasgow. This offers a large exhibition area in a big city to maximize audience and open up the debate to a wider public outside the academic field. The symposium would be focused on the academic research aspect of the project and would be hosted by the TOTeM team resulting in a small publication of the project's outputs to date. This would be available at the symposium but also sent out to key stakeholders in the field.\n\nIt is envisaged that the exhibition would be a pilot for a national touring exhibition with applications made to the Arts Council of England, the Arts Council of Wales and Creative Scotland. As a touring exhibition of arts, design and industrial works the exhibition will be unique in introducing the public to the cultural and social complexity of an Internet of Things.\n\nThe exhibition and symposium would follow the theme of social uses of the Internet of Things. The emphasis on the exhibition would be on creative uses of the Internet of Things creating a visually appealing exhibition made understandable to a general public. We would invite artists and designers such as Anab Jain, Alexandra Deschamps-Sonsino, Durrell Bishop, Christian Nold, UsmanHaque and Anne Galloway, as well as extend our existing relations with Microsoft Research Labs, Mozilla and NCR to explore a continuum between creative and industrial platforms. It is envisaged that this continuum would allow the public to engage with the complex social, ethical and technical issues that are emerging as more of our personal and business networks become 'hooked' up to the environments, artefacts and people that constitute society.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K001396/1","grantId":"EP/K001396/1","fundValue":"10000","fundStart":"2012-08-01","fundEnd":"2013-07-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The symposium and exhibition was the culmination of a three year research project entitled TOTeM (Tales of Things and Electronic Memory) and the work of its research team that has developed technologies to support the association of personal memories with material artefacts. The themes presented in the symposium reflected the investigators interests in the how this technology has disrupted consumer practices, heritage and the geography of things.\n \nI am Seeing Things was held at the Talbot Rice Gallery. With the context of the University of Edinburgh, Talbot Rice Gallery aims to foster relationships between artists and academics, pioneering new branches of research, knowledge and understanding. Since 1975 the gallery has presented a changing programme of exhibitions, including both Scottish and international artists. \n\nThe symposium ran over one day and invited members of the public, academics, artists and the 3rd sector attended the day. Project findings were also displayed in an associated exhibition and following the symposium a book was created including speakers transcripts as well as findings from the TOTeM project.

A central part of the exhibition will be a series of plinths, not containing pristine museum pieces which no one can touch but contained an ever changing cast of artefacts with loans from the National Museum of Scotland, Dundee Contemporary Arts and Oxfam. Alongside this we featured work from exciting UK based artists each exploring the digital and the Internet of Things in their own way- Martin Boyce, Superflux, Dunne and Raby, Tommy Dykes and Max Phillips. We published a small book to accompany the exhibition and symposium which can offer insights to others.
