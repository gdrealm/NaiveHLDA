{"id":"9AA53B04-CA40-48C6-AB85-0D4F8907C05A","title":"DeTOX - Productive whole cell biocatalysis by engineering resistance to toxic products and substrates","abstractText":"Product toxicity is a major problem for many IBBE processes involving production of small molecules by living cells. Toxicity causes yield restrictions &amp; cell lysis, &amp; frequently affects the commercial viability of biomanufacturing. Likewise, small molecules in lignocellulosic feedstocks inhibit bacterial fermentations &amp; ultimately depress product yields. In this CBMNet NIBB-led bid, a team of scientists from four Universities apply their fundamental expertise in systems &amp; synthetic biology &amp; membrane function, to engineer increased resistance to small molecules in the industrially relevant bacteria, E. coli &amp; solventogenic Clostridia. Our innovation is to translate BBSRC-funded research in microbial stress responses, membrane structure &amp; membrane transporters, into the development &amp; commercialisation of innovative applications in IBBE by our 5 commercial partners. A key project output will be a commercial chassis strain, DeTox, with generally increased chemical resistance.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/N010426/1","grantId":"BB/N010426/1","fundValue":"952658","fundStart":"2016-04-01","fundEnd":"2021-03-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Gillian  Stephens","coPersons":["Boyan  Bonev"],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
