{"id":"5ED83EB5-02BF-4568-AEA3-A49A70DBCC8F","title":"UK Gemini support","abstractText":"The Gemini Observatory operates twin 8-m optical/infrared telescopes equipped with some of the most sensitive instruments in the world, one on the summit of Mauna Kea, Hawaii, and the other on Cerro Pachon, Chile, on behalf of a 6 nation partnership. Through the contributions made by the STFC, the UK has access to 20% of the observing time. This time is allocated to astronomers in UK Universities and research institutes through a peer-review process which assesses the scientific merit of observing proposals. To ensure efficient exploitation of Gemini, a small group of astronomers provides support to the UK astronomers in applying for observing time and in formulating the instrument configurations, the movements of the telescopes, and the detector settings so that the observing time is used effectively. The group also supports the evaluation of observing proposals and UK input to the Gemini observatory management. To maintain expertise, group members assist the observatory staff in conducting observations and also conduct their own individual research projects. In this application, we seek renewal of the grant that has supported the UK National Gemini Office at Oxford University since it was established in 1999.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/H004254/1","grantId":"ST/H004254/1","fundValue":"1226250","fundStart":"2009-10-01","fundEnd":"2013-09-30","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Patrick Francis Roche","coPersons":["Roger L Davies","Isobel Mary  Hook"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
