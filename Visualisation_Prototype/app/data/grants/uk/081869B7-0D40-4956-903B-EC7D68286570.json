The aim is to support and enhance the delivery of impact from this cross-cutting programme of research into terrorism, cyber-security, threats to infrastructure, etc. Focussed effort is needed to a) identify existing projects most likely to deliver value to end-users; b) highlight requirements that are currently unfulfilled; and c) break down barriers between researchers and stakeholders in Government, industry and the third sector.</p>\n\n<p>The first priority is to triage the existing research portfolio, to find a small number of projects where there is the opportunity to deliver substantive benefits. The second priority is to promote greater engagement between stakeholders and researchers, ensuring challenges are better understood, with the opportunity for projects to be co-designed.</p>\n\n<p>This role does not require ethical approval to be obtained. Nevertheless, the External Champion will show commitment to the following principles:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>promote the importance of partnership</li>\n\n <li>respect the academic quest for knowledge, as a valued end in itself</li>\n\n <li>engage with ethical and security concerns of researchers and stakeholders</li>\n\n <li>recognise the significance of the GU Programme for stability and well-being</li>\n\n <li>focus on a drive to deliver beneficial, practical outcomes from the GU programme</li>\n\n</ul>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L002582/1","grantId":"ES/L002582/1","fundValue":"672754","fundStart":"2013-04-01","fundEnd":"2016-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Tristram Piers Benedict  Riley-Smith","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
