Recent figures indicate that almost 20% of the population suffer, at some time, from rhinitis and polyposis, ailments that result in inflammation within the nose, with serious consequences on quality of life including full nasal obstruction and loss of smell. These disorders arise from a trigger-happy immune system, with the main culprit being the mast cell. Effective treatment requires detailed understanding of fundamental processes in cell biology and the application of this to mast cells may lead to new therapies for combating allergies. It is known that an increase in calcium causes the mast cell to secrete a battery of chemicals that recruit and stimulate other immune cells, blood vessels and airway muscle. If unchecked, this produces substantial local tissue damage. We seek to understand how, at a very fundamental level, calcium signals are controlled and how these contribute to mast cell activation. This work will shed new light on what happens when things go wrong with these cells and may identify novel therapeutic targets for drug therapy for allergic disorders.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0601485","grantId":"G0601485","fundValue":"599994","fundStart":"2008-01-06","fundEnd":"2011-01-05","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Anant Bhikhu Parekh","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
