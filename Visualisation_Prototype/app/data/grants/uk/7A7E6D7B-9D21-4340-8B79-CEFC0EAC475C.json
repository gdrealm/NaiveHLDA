One protein, TIP1, is particularly important, and if it isn't working properly plants are dwarfed and end up about a third smaller than normal. We know that TIP1 works by attaching fatty acids to proteins, but we don't know which proteins, or how they affect growth. We will use three methods to find proteins to which TIP1 normally attaches fatty acids (TIP1 targets). First, we will compare proteins with fatty acids attached in normal plants with those in plants that don't have TIP1. Any proteins that only have fatty acids attached when TIP1 is present are likely to be targets of TIP1. Secondly, we will take advantage of the fact that proteins with fatty acids gather in cell membranes. We will compare proteins in the membranes of plant cells grown with and without TIP1 to find out which proteins are only present in membranes when TIP1 is working. Finally, we will use specialised yeast cells that change colour when TIP1 binds to another protein to find plant proteins that bind TIP1. To boost our knowledge of how TIP1 works, we will find out where TIP1 is in plant cells, and find out more about the way that TIP1 attaches fatty acids to proteins. At the end of the project we expect to have identified a lot of TIP1 target proteins, to know whether or not these proteins are normally found in plant cell membranes, and to have a good idea how some of them might contribute to plant cell growth.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D013585/1","grantId":"BB/D013585/1","fundValue":"265226","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2008-12-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Claire Suzanne Grierson","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
