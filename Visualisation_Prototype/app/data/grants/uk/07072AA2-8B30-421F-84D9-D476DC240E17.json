Mitochondria contain their own DNA (mtDNA). Variation in this DNA is related to disease. Diseases influenced by mtDNA include obesity, diabetes and hyperlipidemia. However, two aspects of mtDNA are underexplored. The first aspect is the analysis of the number of copies of mtDNA present in cells in relation to human health traits. The second aspect is to study whether the\nnumber of copies of mtDNA is determined by nuclear genes. Our project aims to study whether the number of copies of mtDNA associate with traits related to obesity, diabetes, hyperlipidemia and cognitive function. We also aim to identify nuclear genes controlling the number of copies of mtDNA. To this end, we will determine the number of copies of mtDNA in each of the 20,000 individuals of one population sample (Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, ALSPAC). The results from this project would contribute to the study of obesity, diabetes, hyperlipidemia and cognitive risk traits. This would represent new knowledge and potential benefit for improving human health.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/K002767/1","grantId":"MR/K002767/1","fundValue":"384039","fundStart":"2013-01-14","fundEnd":"2016-01-13","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Santiago  Rodriguez","coPersons":["Raimondo  Ascione","Ian  Day","Susan Margaret Ring","Thomas Richard Gaunt","Deborah Anne Lawlor","Tom Michael Palmer"],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
