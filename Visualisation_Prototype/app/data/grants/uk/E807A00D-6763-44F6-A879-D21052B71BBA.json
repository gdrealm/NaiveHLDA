The Centre is part of the CU Innovative Manufacturing Research Centre (CUIMRC) funded by the EPSRC, and has been a Centre of Excellence for Technology and Industrial Collaboration (CETIC) in Wales in the last six years and was a Centre for Manufacturing Excellence in Phase 1 of the DTI Manufacturing Advisory Service (MAS). In 2001, the MEC initiated a Micro and Nano Manufacturing (MNM) R&amp;D programme with a focus on advanced manufacturing research for micro and nano-systems, one of the priority areas in the UK Technology Strategy. In 2005, in recognition of its research achievements and state-of-the-art facilities in Micro and Nano Technology the Centre became one of the main nodes within the UK MNT Network with the award of a 3.5M capital grant from the DTI and Welsh Assembly Government. Currently, the MEC MNM programme includes a portfolio of two National and eight EC funded research projects with a total budget in excess of 11M. The state-of-the-art nanoscience and nanotechnology equipment that underpins the MEC MNM programme will be made available through this programme to the academic community in the UK.The R&amp;D services offered under this programme will focus on fabrication, processing and characterisation processes which were identified to have the greatest demand in NanoEquip2007, a recently conducted survey by the EPSRC.. In particular, the following services will be made available to the UK academic community through this programme.- Zeiss XB1540 (50% spare capacity): 2D and 3D FIB nanostructuring/lithography; FIB milling with simultaneous SEM; FIB assisted material deposition; prototyping and small batch fabrication of nanodevices, NEMS and nanoelectronics; preparation of microscopy samples; preparation of specimens for atom probe analysis; preparation of TEM lamellae; advanced imaging and compositional analysis (EDX, EBSD and STEM); fabrication of 2D and 3D replication masters; failure analysis and repair of semiconductor devices; high resolution SEM with FE emitter.- Imprio 55 (60%): UV imprinting of nanostructures on 4'' and 8'' wafers; batch fabrication of planner nanodevices, e.g. FETs, sensors and optical components; development of new UV curable functional materials, e.g. organic semiconductors.- XE-100 (60%): nanolithography for fabrication of nanodevices; AFM/STM imaging for characterisation of nanostructures and nanoparticles; structure and morphology characterisation of nanomaterials.- MicroXAM-100-HR (60%): 3D profiling measurements with nanometre resolution in the vertical range; failure analysis of materials; measurements of step heights from 1 nm to 3 mm.- SA/1m (60%): fabrication of nanodevices in nickel from UV imprinted masters; fabrication of masters for thermal imprinting.- Mikrotechnik HEX03 (60%): thermal imprinting of nanostructures on organic thin sheets; batch fabrication of planar nanodevices, e.g. FETs, sensors and optical components; characterisation of new functional organic materials, e.g. organic semiconductors.- Microsystem 50 (60%): replication of nanostructures in thermoplastics; characterisation of new functional thermoplastics for serial manufacture of nanostructures/nanodevices.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F056745/1","grantId":"EP/F056745/1","fundValue":"526757","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2012-12-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Christopher  McGuiganGraham  Hutchings","coPersons":["Peter  Blood","Michael  Bowker","Bhushan Lal Karihaloo","Emmanuel Bruno Brousseau","Duc  Pham","Samuel  Bigot","John Emyr Macdonald","Stefan Simeonov Dimov"],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
