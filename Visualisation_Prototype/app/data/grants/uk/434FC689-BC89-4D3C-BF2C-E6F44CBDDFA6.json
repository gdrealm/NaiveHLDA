The primary goals are characterising and predicting the effect of scatter in delamination propagation data, which is intrinsic to compositesComposite materials are employed in primary load bearing elements of aerospace, automotive and naval structures. The excellent specific stiffness and strength of composites allow reducing the structural weight with respect to alloy based design solutions, thus maximising vehicle payloads and reducing fuel burn. Composite structural elements exhibit peculiar failure modes, having excellent in-plane strength but being extremely weak through-the-thickness, i.e. prone to delaminations, i.e. fracture between contiguous plies. The latter are held responsible for about 60% of structural failures affecting composite elements in aerospace structures. Fatigue is particularly important in rotating components subject to high vibration and cyclic loading, e.g. aero engines; moreover delamination growth from barely visible damages represents a significant hazard for composite fuselage and wing panels. Therefore the prediction of the onset and growth of delaminations due to fatigue is crucial for assessing the operating performance and reliability of composite structures. Modelling the delamination propagation under fatigue represents the corner-stone of a damage tolerance approach to the design of composite structures. Delamination growth exhibits a significant statistical dispersion, so damage tolerance design requires estimating the probability of having interlaminar cracks reaching critical detectable lengths between inspections, following which the defective structural elements can be eventually repaired or substituted. The majority of primary composite structural elements are still designed according to safe-life criteria, i.e. limiting the allowable strains so that initial defects do not grow. Thus designers employ large safety factors, and there is potential for substantial weight savings as a result of the work proposed here, which essentially aims to better understand the variability in fatigue behaviour.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H040188/1","grantId":"EP/H040188/1","fundValue":"100637","fundStart":"2010-05-01","fundEnd":"2011-07-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The semi-empirical equations describing fatigue delamination growth in composites have been used by Rolls-Royce plc to carry out studies on the structural integrity of aero-engine components as part of the certification process.

It consists in the progressive dis-bond of the fibre-reinforced plies that constitute the composite. Delaminations usually propagate under cyclic loading, as cracks in metals do. This phenomenon is denoted as fatigue. This project has lead to the discovery of new semi-empirical equations that govern the fatigue delamination growth in composites. This equations can be employed to predict the life of structural elements in service, enhancing reliability, safety and reducing direct operating costs. The semi-empirical equations discovered in this project can be used by engineers via hand calculations or numerical methods, such as finite element analysis.
