It is often assumed that LGBT communities have a shared experience of oppression or exclusion from broader communities, yet what research exists tends to be disparately located across varied disciplines (e.g. humanities, health studies, social sciences). The term has also been critiqued for neglecting diversities within and between LGBT communities. Nevertheless, research has documented the historical development of LGBT communities, for example in relation to 'gay rights' political activism, community responses to the emergence of HIV/AIDS, and in the growth of the commercial 'gay scene'. The value of social support from community members has been reported as beneficial to LGBT health and wellbeing, particularly where individuals may be excluded from their own families or immediate communities (Keogh et al 2006; Pugh 2002; Weeks et al 2001). The review element of this study will seek to draw together evidence in this area, supplemented by a complementary consultation exercise. \n\nThe consultation stage will involve the use of an interactive website and four workshops; three of these will take place within LGBT communities and one will be for professionals working in the LGBT field. Potential participants will be invited to contribute comments or other 'submissions' (e.g. photographs) to the website and/or invited to take part in discussions as part of a workshop. Issues that will be explored within both the literature review and consultation stages will include exploration of how community members perceive their relationship and potential contribution to wider society as well as current policy interests in equality, community cohesion and civic participation within a 'big society'. Greater understanding of these issues also relates to perceptions of community self-reliance and sustainability. Throughout, there will be an explicit focus on an assessment of the implications of understandings and experiences of 'community' for LGBT health, wellbeing and 'quality of life'. The study will contribute to developing thought and discussion about the meanings of 'community' and 'connectedness' more generally within the Connected Communities programme, for example what it is that creates and maintains links between potentially diverse groups of people, currently and over time. In particular, for minority groups, how much does a sense of 'community' relate to historical and cultural contexts (e.g. experiences of 'belonging' or shared identity vs. experiences of exclusion, protest and/or adversity)? Similarly, how much are communities rooted in shared values or experiences (despite their potential diversity), or is there a necessity for physical proximity (e.g. the commercial gay scene, Pride events) and/or virtual connections (via the Internet)? General insights on understandings and experiences of 'community' and potentially socially excluded groups will be gleaned from a close examination of LGBT communities in their specific social and historical contexts.\n\nA study aim is to engage and bring together academics, practitioners and LGBT community members. Final outputs will include an accessible project summary, a Discussion Paper, and a national dissemination event. These will bring together themes from both existing research and insights from the consultation. They will establish to what extent the review themes correspond with participants' and stakeholders' experiences, or if anything is missing from the review, thus pointing to current research gaps. The website will remain as a legacy of the project and its outcomes (including all documents produced and an online references resource).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/J011894/1","grantId":"AH/J011894/1","fundValue":"28769","fundStart":"2012-02-10","fundEnd":"2012-11-09","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  I am aware they have been used in academia (citations and so on), and have been engaged with by practitioners in the LGBT sector. For example, a community-based organisation/charity used the report in a funding bid to explain/justify the need for safe LGBT spaces outside of the commercial scene. This bid was successful and they now run an LGBT caf&eacute;. The findings also fed into workshops (through a presentation I delivered beforehand) to identify community needs at the launch of a community-led LGBT initiative regionally. In addition, it has informed local authority LGBT hate crime reporting and community safety planning (via my advice to/meeting with local authority staff working in this field).\n\nThere was also media interest (Nov. 2012) in the gay press (Sosogay), international press (Rainbow Sudan), and regional media (Yorkshire Times). The final project event (which was highly over-subscribed, Nov. 2012) was designed to stimulate discussion about the meaning and desirability of constructions of 'LGBT communities'. It led to very positive feedback from attendees (a mix of 80 project participants, practitioners, academics, and the general public), with comments including &quot;inspiring&quot; and &quot;brilliantly informative&quot;. Practitioners emphasised how it would inform their practice: &quot;I found the conference very interesting and it gave me some idea's to discuss with [an LGBT forum]&quot;; &quot;It certainly gave me some food for thought regarding trans provision for young people&quot;. The long-term impact of improved professional awareness and practice is therefore on enhanced support for LGBT people, though individual LGBT people have also benefited directly from involvement in the research through being enabled to share their collective experiences.

They might also influence community-level support and/or leisure provision aimed at LGBT people, and more broadly influence attitudes towards LGBT people among service-providers, whether in education or healthcare, etc Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Healthcare,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections","dataset":"gtr"}
