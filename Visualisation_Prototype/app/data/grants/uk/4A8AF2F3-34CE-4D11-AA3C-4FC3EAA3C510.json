Mechanisms of attention enable us to allocate limited brain resources to the most important sensory events. Although attention has been studied for several decades in psychology, much remains to be discovered about the brain mechanisms of attentional control, particularly in relation to interactions between different senses (e.g. vision, touch, hearing). The research described in this proposal will employ a unique combination of neuroscience methods to probe the basis of selective attention in the healthy human brain. In particular, we will investigate attentional processes in vision and touch through concurrent stimulation (TMS) and recording (fMRI) of human brain activity. By combining these techniques simultaneously, we will address the crucial unanswered question of how attentional mechanisms in high-level brain regions control activity in lower sensory areas, both within and between different sensory modalities. Overall, this research promises to make an important contribution to our understanding of the brain mechanisms that support human perception and attention.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E020291/2","grantId":"BB/E020291/2","fundValue":"402636","fundStart":"2008-04-14","fundEnd":"2011-04-13","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Christopher David Chambers","coPersons":["Jonathon  Driver"],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
