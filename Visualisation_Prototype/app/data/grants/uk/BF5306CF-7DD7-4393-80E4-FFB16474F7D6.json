{"id":"BF5306CF-7DD7-4393-80E4-FFB16474F7D6","title":"Civil War in Transnational Perspective","abstractText":"<p>This project is part of a European Collaborative Research Programme on 'Disaggregating Civil Wars', with partners at the Center for International Studies in Zurich and the Centre for the Study of Civil War in Oslo. </p> \n<p>The Essex node examines how third parties and transnational linkages influence interactions between central governments and insurgents groups within a bargaining framework, where violence may occur if parties fail to reach or maintain agreements. It considers a wider range of motives and forms of third-party interventions. Whereas previous research has tended to look exclusively at state or country characteristics, the project considers what specific combinations of government and non-state actor characteristics can make peaceful settlements feasible or, alternatively, violence more likely. </p> \n<p>The theoretical framework will inform empirical analyses of civil war, based on new disaggregated data to be compiled by the project on conflict events, peripheral groups, and transnational linkages. Through advancing the study of civil war and examining how actor network configurations shape the prospects for conflict and peace, the project allows assessing the feasibility and likely effectiveness of different peacekeeping strategies and hence contributes to more effective policies of conflict management and prevention.</p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E007147/1","grantId":"ES/E007147/1","fundValue":"334225","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Skrede  Gleditsch","coPersons":["Hugh  Ward","Todd  Landman","Han  Dorussen","Abhinay  Muthoo"],"organisation":"University of Essex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
