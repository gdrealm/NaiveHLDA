We will focus on their association with important partners called arrestins. Arrestins regulate receptor activity, contributing to drug tolerance, and also organise signalling leading to cell survival or differentiation. \n\nIn our technique we add two halves of a fluorescent protein to the receptor and arrestin molecules, so that the light from it will only be seen when the segments are brought together by a receptor-arrestin complex. We will then identify these complexes by a range of imaging methods, some of which can examine behaviour at a single molecule level. This will tell us more about the molecular controls that govern the formation of different receptor-arrestin combinations, and how these controls generate alternative patterns of signalling. \n\nWe hope that this will help a wide scientific community, including those interested in the particular receptors under study (for the neurotransmitter Neuropeptide Y) as targets to treat obesity, and those who see potential for receptor drugs that selectively alter arrestin signalling.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0700049","grantId":"G0700049","fundValue":"426938","fundStart":"2008-01-01","fundEnd":"2010-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Nicholas Dargue Holliday","coPersons":["Stephen John Hill","Stephen  Briddon"],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
