Our aim is to understand molecular mechanisms that control this relationship. To achieve this, we will adapt a recent technological breakthrough in physics allowing the monitoring of molecular mobility on the scale of nanoseconds. Results obtained with this novel methodology should ultimately unveil previously unknown targets for drug action.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0802216","grantId":"G0802216","fundValue":"977646","fundStart":"2009-05-01","fundEnd":"2014-03-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Dmitri  Rusakov","coPersons":["Klaus  Suhling"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
