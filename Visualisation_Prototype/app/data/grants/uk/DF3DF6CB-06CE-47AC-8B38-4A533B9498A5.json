{"id":"DF3DF6CB-06CE-47AC-8B38-4A533B9498A5","title":"Developing participation in social design: prototyping projects, programmes and policies","abstractText":"The 'Social Design Futures: HEIs and the AHRC' report (Armstrong et al 2014) demonstrated that in order to take social design research forward in meaningful and sustainable ways, programmes needed to be undertaken that expanded and developed its constituencies. It also pointed out that new forms of collaboration and communication of research across disciplinary boundaries, but also beyond HEIs, needed to be modelled. This proposal presents a follow-up phase in order to maintain and develop the momentum built through the Mapping Social Design project.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/N504269/1","grantId":"AH/N504269/1","fundValue":"50087","fundStart":"2015-01-04","fundEnd":"2016-01-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Guy  Julier","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Brighton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
