{"id":"75B75C51-B373-41F3-9889-63CEDB618529","title":"The Socio-Politics of Biosecurity: Science, Policy and Practice","abstractText":"<p>Biosecurity is the management of biological risks to ecological wellbeing or the health of humans, animals and plants, and it is increasingly a part of daily life. In the UK in 2008, foot-and-mouth disease, bird flu, bluetongue, and sudden oak death and a potentially new human form of mad cow disease (variant CJD), were just a few of the many high profile biosecurity issues confronting governing institutions, the academic community, and the wider public. These issues raise some important intellectual and policy-related questions in a rapidly-changing world. For instance:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>Would increased biosecurity reduce health risks and increase the ecological wellbeing of humans?</li>\n\n <li>Does the idea of 'native' plant or animal species make any sense in today's globalising and climate-changed world?</li>\n\n <li>Why would any country want a plant and/or animal biosecurity regime?</li>\n\n <li>Does the implementation of plant and animal biosecurity imply unacceptable levels of citizen surveillance?</li>\n\n <li>Can biosecurity be compatible with private property rights?</li>\n\n <li>Is multicultural social policy undermined by plant and animal biosecurity policy?</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>These interdisciplinary seminars thus respond to the urgent need for a scientific, political, cultural and social examination of biosecurity, and for the space for a critical conversation to be facilitated between social and physical sciences, and environmental governing bodies.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/H001735/1","grantId":"ES/H001735/1","fundValue":"18292","fundStart":"2009-11-02","fundEnd":"2011-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  No data is available to answer this question.

'Discoveries' and 'developments' are detailed in the way we met these objectives.\n\n1.to scope, and thence to set, an interdisciplinary research agenda in the field of socio-politics of biosecurity issues. Objective met: by organising the seminars around the following themes: i) an examination of policy frameworks, nationally and internationally, ii) studies of policy implementation, iii) normative justifications for biosecurity, iv) relationship between cultural and bio-ecological norms, and v) lay/expert value conflicts.\n2. to encourage interdisciplinary work on environmental change, not only within the social sciences but also between the social and natural sciences. Objective met: of the 50 University academics who attended the seminars, 18 were natural scientists and 32 were social scientists.\n3. to encourage the participation of doctoral students and early career researchers in the seminars and in the network which will develop from them. Objective met: participants included 50 university academics, 23 members of the policy community, 9 early career researchers (PhD). This gives a PhD student count of 12.3%, rising to 15.06% if we count the two co-applicants, both of whom are early career researchers, as was pointed out in the original application.\n4. to pump prime larger collaborative project grants on knowledge gaps in biosecurity identified by the seminar series. Objective met: Co-PI Dr Sarah Taylor was involved in the drawing up the sections on invasive species for Keele University's ?6 million Life + bid. Data unavailable for other participants in the seminar series.\n5. to contribute to evidence-based policy-making by encouraging the interaction of academics and policy makers in the field of biosecurity. Objective met: Participants included 50 university academics and 23 members of the policy community. Innovative theoretical conceptualisations of biosecurity are being forged in connection to diverse literatures including biopolitics, post-humanism, global networked cities, geopolitics and inequalities, security governance regimes and the sociology of fear and risk. However, a consistent concern is the lack of dialogue between the social sciences and biosecurity policy regimes. Our seminar series was an attempt to pump-prime this dialogue, and in our view it is essential that this dialogue be continued. This is especially important in the context of the policy community, where our impression is that the social, cultural and political aspects/elements of biosecurity are not sufficiently integrated into the policy-making process.
