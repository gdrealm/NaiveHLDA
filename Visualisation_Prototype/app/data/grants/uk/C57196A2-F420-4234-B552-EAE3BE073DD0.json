The microscopic structure can change as a function of temperature and pressure. In extreme cases this temperature- or pressure-dependence of structure is very pronounced and there may be discontinuous changes with structure over a narrow range in temperature or pressure which can be thought of as an amorphous-amorphous or liquid-liquid transition. The nature of these transitions is controversial and the jumps between different structures can be continuous or discontinuous. Although in principle it is straightforward to link the structure of liquids and the thermodynamic properties such as configurational entropy, there is no proven link. This is because there are very few studies of liquid structure in situ and even fewer studies in the supercooled liquid regime, where these properties change most rapidly. In this proposed work, we will investigate the structure of supercooled and stable liquids of candidate polyamorphic systems and related amorphous materials using in-situ diffraction techniques and specialised sample environments. Liquids lack long-range order and the periodicity that so characterises the crystalline state. Diffraction techniques, used to study liquid structure therefore involve diffuse scattering and this limits the techniques that are available. While neutron diffraction is ideal, the scattered signal is weak and requires long counting times to achieve reasonable statistics. High energy X-rays are neutron-like in that they penetrate liquid samples and act more as a bulk probe, also they can be focused and masked to give a small spot size allowing diffraction data to be collected on a short time scale for samples such as levitated liquid spheres. High energy X-rays are further suited to studying oxide liquids because they are able to probe metal-metal correlations (the signal from neutron diffraction is dominated by the scatter from oxygen), that reflect differences in mid-range order, that is differences in the way that individual structural units are configured. High energy X-ray studies have been carried out successfully on stable levitated liquids this proposed experiment is the first time that the super cooled regime of Y2O3-Al2O3 has been probed. Containerless levitation is a technique that can be used to study these liquids. Containerless levitation can be combined with synchrotron X-ray techniques to determine liquid structure and we have successfully applied small and wide angle X-ray scattering at the Synchrotron radiation Source, Daresbury (UK) to investigate, for the first time the transition in a Y2O3-Al2O3 liquid, this set of experiments has shown that there is an increase in small angle signal at the point of transition, indicating fluctuations in density and some apparent changes in wide angle signal. The data that can be obtained from the wide angle measurements is limited however because the incident energy of the X-rays used at the SRS is too low; this limits the penetration into the sample and limits the amount of structural data that can be obtained. The results from the SRS have been used to make a successful application for a research program at the APS to use very high energy X-rays and conventional diffraction techniques to study the same liquids in situ.Although the work will focus on the Y2O3-Al2O3 system, other related systems will be studied using both pressure and temperature extremes. X-ray studies of some MgO-SiO2 liquids have been studied at APS and some high pressure data for equivalent glasses collected. Again these show discontinuous changes in structure. Similarly studies of enriched B2O3 by neutrons show unequivocal changes in structure with pressure but further work is required to determine whether these systems fit into the general classification of polyamorphic liquids.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E026818/1","grantId":"EP/E026818/1","fundValue":"20579","fundStart":"2006-11-19","fundEnd":"2008-11-18","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Martin Charles Wilding","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Aberystwyth University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
