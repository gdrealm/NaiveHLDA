This research explores the ways in which the policy-driven agendas of social inclusion and efficiency are reshaping the publicly-funded museum sector, and inducing new organisational and professional roles, values and cultures. It uses mainly a qualitative methodological framework informed by theoretical lenses drawn from the sociologies of organisations and the professions, as well as museum studies. The data consists mainly of policy documents and in-depth semi-structured interviews. The policy documents are analysed to highlight the ways in which the museum professions are constructed, the types of changes required and how these changes are framed and justified at three levels of governance â€“ government, professional organisations and museum management. Interviews are conducted with a) museum staff acting in a cross-section of roles to examine the professional culture or cultures that are emerging in response to policy-driven changes; and with b) museum senior managers and policy officers from professional organisations and local authorities to explore how this cultural change to the museum professions is being conceived, driven and supported at the three levels of governance.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-061-25-0039","grantId":"RES-061-25-0039","fundValue":"71307","fundStart":"2008-01-01","fundEnd":"2009-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  The findings have been used and cited by both academic and professional publications.

This turn widens the operational remit of the publicly-funded museum and how it should relate to its 'outside', including the formal education sector, local communities, and a number of public and social services sharing the broad objectives of the museum as a social institution: namely, the improvement of quality of life and well-being. In parallel, museum work has been subjected to a regime of performance management aimed to steer it towards an organisational culture of measurable accountability and entrepreneurialism.\n\nThis research has shown that these policy-driven measures are reshaping the meanings and realities of museum work, affecting a range of aspects, including workforce development, skills needs and gaps, the nature of the work process, the distribution of roles and resources, and the way museums relate to various stakeholders and adjacent fields. These impacts, however, are not uniform: they are mediated primarily by the factors of size and correlated source of funding. In local museums numerical targets are set by local authorities who generally seek to harness museum work, despite its perceived marginality, to local social policy priorities. In contrast, within national museums performance management is much more 'light-touch', thus allowing for a great deal of organisational and professional autonomy. Nonetheless, in larger museums key performance indicators (KPIs) can produce tensions, including those relating to competing interpretations of what the KPIs mean, and their implications for the content/mode of organisational/individual action. On the other hand, the research has found that there has been a recent shift away from the narrow focus on quantitative indicators, and towards a peer-review model of informed assessment with emphasis on capturing quality.\n\nWhilst some form of evaluating performance can be seen as legitimate and necessary on the ground that museums do not exist for themselves but for society, the performance management culture can be in tension with professional autonomy and values and a sense of professional identity. This constrains what museums can do to explore and actualise their potential and added value to culture and society. However strongly people believe in the necessity for measurable accountability and an expanded social role for museums, there is still the predominant conviction - rooted in a baseline professional value - that the collections serve as the linchpin of a coherent vision underlying the museum's organisational strategies. Re-affirming the primacy of the collections does not sit very comfortably with recent museum policies that position the public as 'the measure of all things' done by the museum. The current policy-driven organisational culture favours visitor-oriented activities and roles; this is manifest in various ways through, for example: distributed resources, recruitment, professional development and promotion/career progression opportunities. These changes create a sustainability problem with regard to the collections that affects not only the scholarship/interpretation around them, but their very maintenance and conservation. \n\nThe organisational culture of museums is often caught up in a short-termist modus operandi that affects not only their strategic planning, employment and recruitment policies, but also the sustainability of community relations and the social inclusion work that the museum develops (e.g. one-off targets-driven events with no sustained follow-ups). A sustainability problem also affects the sector's need for expertise and skills that are not currently supplied through the university-based museum studies courses. The standardisation of pre-entry routes into museum work and its ostensible 'rationalisation' through postgraduate courses have, paradoxically, been coupled with growing skills gaps. Despite some recognised merits, the current mode of pre-entry professional education falls short of meeting the skills needs and gaps in the sector (e.g. context-sensitive, object-related and curatorial skills), in part due to the limited work-relevance of curricular contents and modes of delivery, and in part due to the fact that courses are often shaped less by the quality/quantity of skills the sector needs than by the organisational dynamics and stakes of academia. The need to rethink pre-entry (and even post-entry) professional education is perhaps accentuated by another conclusion from the findings: museum work is now defined more around organisation-specific dynamics than around a core cognitive and normative professional framework (however minimal and tentative) that could be seen as necessary and sufficient for entry into museum work. The findings can be used to inform museum and art/cultural policies more generally both at sector and organization levels. This can happen especially in connection with the areas of education, outreach and community-related work as well as work workforce and professional development. They can also be used as a springboard for further research across different types of art organizations (not just museums and art galleries). This is something that I have already moved onto in the context of my teaching, more specifically in the context of an Master's degree programme that I created and designed in collaboration with the London Southbank Centre (MA in Education in Arts &amp; Cultural Settings) launched in 2011. This MA programme embodies the principle of research-led teaching to the extent that its initial conception and design as well as its ongoing conduct and delivery are underpinned and driven in substantive ways by the transferrable knowledge, expertise and skills that I have gained through the ESRC project.
