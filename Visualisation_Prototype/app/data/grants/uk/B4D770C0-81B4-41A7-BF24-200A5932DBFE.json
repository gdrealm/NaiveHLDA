Current methods for the detection of influenza all take at least several hours and require specialist equipment and trained analysts. Rapid diagnostic tests do exist, but all are relatively crude and unable to distinguish between seasonal, pandemic and animal strains of influenza virus. The aim of this project is to develop a simple diagnostic test, based on practical and inexpensive gold nanoparticle-based colorimetric assays. Gold nanoparticles in aqueous solution exhibit an intense red colour that upon clustering of the nanoparticles changes colour to purple - readily observed with the naked eye. By functionalising gold nanoparticles with specific carbohydrate ligands, glyconanoparticles capable of clustering on flu virus surfaces will be developed, thus detecting and discriminating between human and animal strains.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/M021769/1","grantId":"BB/M021769/1","fundValue":"193837","fundStart":"2015-04-01","fundEnd":"2016-08-11","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Rob  Field","coPersons":["Mark  Searcey"],"organisation":"John Innes Centre","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
