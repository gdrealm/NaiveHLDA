The first step toward addressing this concern is to try to understand the basic systems underlying memory in the brain. A better understanding of memory systems will help us to develop treatments or strategies to deal better with age-related memory impairments. One critical aspect of memory systems that is poorly understood is the specific contribution of the different molecules involved. The proposed research will help us understand the molecular signals important for memory by testing the effects of drugs on tasks requiring different aspects of memory, eventually helping the large proportion of the population who will become more forgetful as they get older.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/G019002/1","grantId":"BB/G019002/1","fundValue":"314231","fundStart":"2009-09-25","fundEnd":"2013-03-24","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  No impact beyond academia as yet.

It is easier to remember a set of items in a memory test if they are presented a few seconds before memory retrieval, than if they are presented several hours before. When memory fails, as it does normally in old age, or under pathological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, this failure is reflected in the inability to remember over an extended period of time - although the ability to remember over a few seconds may remain intact. Increasingly, however Understanding the process by which memories for similar events become separated in the brain to prevent confusion is essential to understand normal memory storage and also memory loss as it happens with age or in the face of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's. Our findings are important because it has been shown that there are simple ways of increasing both neurogenesis and BDNF in the brain, like voluntary exercise or caloric restriction.
