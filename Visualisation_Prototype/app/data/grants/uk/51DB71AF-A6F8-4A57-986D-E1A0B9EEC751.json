Clinical trials conducted by a network of childhood cancer specialists supported by the Medical Research Council have contributed to the current relatively good cure rate for this leukaemia. However, initial treatment fails in around 25% of patients and they require very toxic and expensive further therapy which is not effective for many children. Also, some of those who are cured develop physical, mental and social problems in adult life due to the toxicity of their leukaemia therapy. This trial seeks to make two improvements in the treatment of children with ALL. First, to increase the success of initial treatment so that the disease recurs (comes back) in fewer patients. Second, reduce the treatment for patients who have a low risk of recurrence so that they have less immediate and late treatment-related problems. Both these aims could be fulfilled by tailoring treatment to the risk of recurrence using a new test called Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) which allows a very accurate prediction of this risk. Using genetic technology for measuring Minimal Residual Disease, we can detect and quantify 1 leukaemic cell mixed in with 10,000 normal cells. The level of leukaemia detected by this technique after 28 days of treatment accurately separates those patients with a greater than 90% chance of cure (good risk) from those with a less than 75% chance (high risk). This trial will ask the following two questions: (1) Can patients defined as good risk by the MRD test achieve the same cure rate as at present but with less treatment so that they have fewer immediate and late side-effects of therapy? (2)Can the chance of cure for patients defined as high risk by the MRD test be improved by giving them more treatment? In addition to looking at the chances of survival and leukaemia recurrence, we will also assess the impact of these treatment changes on patient and family quality of life and health service economics.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0300130","grantId":"G0300130","fundValue":"1060540","fundStart":"2003-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Ajay  Vora","coPersons":["Ian Malcolm Hann","Richard  Peto","Christopher  Mitchell"],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
