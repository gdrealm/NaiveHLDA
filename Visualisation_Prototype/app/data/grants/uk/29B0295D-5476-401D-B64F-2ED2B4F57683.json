{"id":"29B0295D-5476-401D-B64F-2ED2B4F57683","title":"G8 Multilateral Research Funding - ExArch","abstractText":"Climate science demands on data management are growing rapidly as climate models grow in the precision with which they depict spatial structures and in the completeness with which they describe a vast range of physical processes.\nFor the Climate Model Inter-comparison Project 5 (CMIP5), a distributed archive is being constructed to provide\naccess to what is expected to be in excess of 10 Peta-bytes of global climate change projections. The data will be held at 30 or more computing centres and data archives around the world, but for users it will appear as a single archive described by one catalogue. In addition, the usability of the data will be enhanced by a three-step\nvalidation process and the publication of Digital Object Identifiers (doi) for all the data.\nFor many users the spatial resolution provided by the global climate models (around 150km) is inadequate: the\nCORDEX project will provide data scaled down to around 10km. Evaluation of climate impacts often revolves\naround extremes and complex impact factors, requiring high volumes of data to be stored. At the same time,\nuncertainty about the optimal configuration of the models imposes the requirement that each scenario be explored with multiple models. This project will explore the challenges of developing a software management infrastructure which will scale to the multi-exabyte archives of climate data which are likely to be crucial to major policy decisions in by the end of the decade. Support for automated processing of the archived data and metadata will be essential. In the short term goal, strategies will be evaluated by applying them to the CORDEX project data.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/J00538X/1","grantId":"NE/J00538X/1","fundValue":"289003","fundStart":"2011-04-06","fundEnd":"2014-12-24","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  Findings are being used in preparation for the CMIP6 archive of climate model projections, and in providing CMIP5 data through subcontract to a commercial user.

The non-UK partners are funded by their own research agencies. NERC has funded overall project leadership, development of a processing service, and of a quality control system. \nThe processing service provides a range of tools for regridding and computing a broad range of statistical quantities.\nThe quality control tool provides improved flexibility and reliability. An emerging requirement, not foreseen in the proposal, was to test consistency of the tables used to specify data format requirements. Specifications had been largely checked by proof reading, and this approach failed to deal with the subtle interdependencies in the syntax of the requirements. The new software for verifying consistency of requirements has provided support for 3 major international collaborative projects and is likely to form the basis of improved preparation of specifications for the CMIP6 archive, Web Processing Services developed in the project are now providing a range of services giving added value to the BADC archive.
