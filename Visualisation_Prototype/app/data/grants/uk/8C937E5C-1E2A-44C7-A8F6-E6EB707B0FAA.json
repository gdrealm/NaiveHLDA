It is part of a larger ECRP funded project on Migration and Networks of Care in Europe with partners in Ireland, the Netherlands and Germany. </p> \n<p>The context for the project is the dynamic created by the rise in women’s employment, the demand for domestic and care services provided in private households, and the increased provision of those services by migrant women. This particular study looks at the role that policies for the care of young children and older people play in this dynamic, and how and why this varies across different European welfare regimes. </p> \n<p>Drawing on a qualitative study of employers and employees in home based child care in London, Madrid and Stockholm, the study develops a framework for a cross-national analysis of the interaction between ‘migration regimes’, ‘care policy regimes’ and ‘care cultures’ across six countries: UK, Sweden, Spain, Ireland, Germany and the Netherlands. Its main aims are to develop a theoretical understanding of welfare restructuring in Europe within an international, post-colonial and gendered context, and to contribute to policy recommendations in the areas of care, migration and employment in households. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-1514","grantId":"RES-000-22-1514","fundValue":"48634","fundStart":"2006-09-01","fundEnd":"2009-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"J.F.
