Current technology allows the creationof light pulses that are comparable in duration to the time it takesan electron to orbit an atom. By subjecting atoms to these shortpulses, it may be possible to adjust the electronic motion and henceto control the atom to an unprecedented degree.We aim to develop a theory that can be used to accurately predict theresponse of the entire multi-electron atom. To do so, we combinea multi-electron atomic theory, such as the R-matrix theory, withtime-dependent numerical techniques to obtain a novel approach for thedescription of atoms: the time-dependent R-matrix theory. We will developa substantial, new, computational program, containing several thousandsof lines of code, which exploits existing programs, developed by theapplicants, and which builds on our expertise in developing new programsas a world-leading group in theoretical atomic physics. This program willrequire significant computational resources, and the codes to be developedwill thus be developed for mid-range parallel computers.Initial investigations will be focussed on the noble-gas atoms from Neonwards, since these are the atoms most often used in state-of-the-artshort-pulse experiments. However, these atoms can only be studiedtheoretically with proper accuracy through explicit multi-electron techniques,such as the ones in the proposed method. By comparing results obtainedby the time-dependent R-matrix program with results obtained by thetime-independent R-matrix Floquet program, we will furthermore developunique insight into the detailed atomic dynamics in strong laser fields.Following the initial investigation of the behaviour of atoms in ultra-short pulses,we will continue the development of the codes towards the investigation ofprocesses in which two electrons are ejected. These processes will be ofincreasing interest in the coming years due to new free-electron laser facilities,which will provide high-intensity X-ray radiation. When atoms are subjected tosuch radiation, several electrons can be emitted simultaneously. The developmentof a computer code capable of describing double ionization of general atoms inintense light fields will thus provide a massive boost to all research exploiting thesenew X-ray radiation facilities.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E000223/1","grantId":"EP/E000223/1","fundValue":"310885","fundStart":"2006-10-09","fundEnd":"2009-10-08","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The time-dependent R-matrix computer code developed in this project has formed the basis for a new R-matrix with time dependence code.

The development of experimental facilities capable of generating ultra-short light pulses requires complementary development of theoretical methods capable of describing these processes to ensure that maximum physical knowledge is gained at these facilities. Before the start of the project, most computational codes were limited to the description of single-electron atoms or atoms in which two electrons could move outside a closed core. However, most experiments use atoms such as neon and argon in which eight\nelectrons can be considered as outer electrons.\n\nWe succeeded in developing this new computer code. The code uses the R-matrix approach of separating space into two regions: an inner region where all electrons interact strongly with each other and an outer region where one electron has moved far away from the others, so that the description of its motion can be greatly simplified. First we developed a code that enabled us to describe intense-field processes within an inner region only. We subsequently developed a code which uses this R-matrix separation. This latter code allows for easier parallelisation. We have implemented this parallelisation, and it allows the code to run efficiently on up to 200 cores.\n\nWe have applied this code to demonstrate new physics that could be explored at state-of-the-art experimental facilities. We have demonstrated that ultra-fast excitation of an atomic configuration leads to highly correlated electron dynamics in which the motion of two electrons move is precisely correlated. This was first demonstrated through ionization yields, and subsequently through the angular distributions of the ejected electrons associated with an excited state of a residual ion.\n\nA second problem addressed relates to single-photon versus multiphoton ionization at free-electron laser facilities. For short pulses, the frequency uncertainty induced by the short duration may allow single-photon ionization to dominate even though at the central frequency two photons are required for ionization. Using the time-dependent R-matrix approach, we were able to explain\nhow the contributions of single-photon ionization and two-photon ionization combine to form the total ionization yield.\n\nThese results demonstrate that the time-dependent R-matrix approach can be applied successfully to study atoms in intense short-pulse light fields. The approach can be used to interpret experimental observations, but can also be used to assist experimentalists with deciding whether or not suggested\nexperiments are feasible.\n\nA second line of investigation has been the initial study of how an inner region R-matrix-based approach could be combined with a finite-difference scheme in the outer region. This initial study was focused on the single-electron hydrogen atom. The R-matrix inner region and the finite-difference scheme were combined successfully demonstrating that this approach may have good promise as a future\nmethod for studying, in particular, multi-electron emission in general atoms. We hope that the developments in this project will lead to more efficient exploitation of free-electron laser facilities, in the first instance. This exploitation may in the future lead to a wide range of societal and economic benefits. This grant involved the development of new computational codes to investigate matter in new types of light fields. \n\nIt is hoped that the new understanding of science will benefit the development of new light sources, including ultra-short light pulses and free-electron laser facilities. These facilities may benefit a wide range of science. Atomic physics experiments are key experiments in understanding the operation of these new light sources, and we can now provide new theory to facilitate the understanding of these experiments.\n\nWe are now also involved in transferring the technology developed in this project to the theoretical description of molecules in intense light fields. This will offer a much wider range of applications to the technology developed in this project.
