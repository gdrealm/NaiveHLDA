Currently, there is no available technology which allows the detection of tainted carcasses on the production line to remove them from the food chain. The University of the West of England has developed prototype technology for the detection of boar taint to fill this gap in the international market. Initial feedback from end-users and market research indicated that the technology will be in high demand in the UK and on the international level. The main objectives of this project are to undertake further technological development and evaluation of our technology to demonstrate its commercial potential to end-users. This includes identifying the best route for bringing the technology to market and its mass-production; making contacts with licensees and improving the intellectual property position. The project is supported by JSR Genetics, and Biosciences Knowledge Transfer Partnership.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/L024268/1","grantId":"BB/L024268/1","fundValue":"118247","fundStart":"2014-04-02","fundEnd":"2015-04-01","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  This project s still in progress and therefore it is not possible to make any statements regarding how findings have been used.

Therefore, the work on the project is still in progress. All the objectives to the day have been met. The project aims to take new technology for boar taint detection to national and international market and, in particular, to benefit the UK pig industry. The technology details are confidential and a patent application has been filed. The reserach has identified industry requirements to the novel technology, incorporated them in the technology design and improved performance of the new technology. Evaluation of the novel technology has been conducted on adipose tissue samples provided by the industrial partner. Extensive market reserach has been conducted and potential licencees for the technology have been identified. Manufacturers of the novel technology have been identified. IP position and IP provision have been improved. There is currently no technology on international market which would allow rapid and cost-effective detection of boar taint at the point of test/on-line. There is a great need in this technology at international and, especially, at European level. This is, in particular, related to EU legislation on ban of piglets castration as a method of prevention of boar tain, by 2018. The new technology developed and evaluated in this project will help to address the need of international pig industry in effective methods for detection of boar taint in entire pigs. This reserach will also benefit equipment manufacturing companies which can take licences for the technology manufacturing and/or distribution. The technology might be of benefit to pharmaceutical companies which produce vaccine to prevention of boar taint. The novel technology could be used for evaluation of effectiveness of vaccination. The technology would benefit international agricultural sector and consumers via ensuring that only taint-free meat enters food chain. Results of this reserach can also be used for educational purposes in undegraduate and post-graduate teaching, influence future EU policies related to animal welfare and stimulate international networking. The technology will have environmental impact as it will facilitate the production of entire male pigs which is more environmentally friendly then production of castrated animals.
