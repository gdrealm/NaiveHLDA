{"id":"36D44F04-AEB6-4B2F-BA20-8D1E37ECEBF4","title":"Working Late: Strategies to Enhance Productive and Healthy Environments for the Older Workforce","abstractText":"<p>The increasing age of the UK workforce presents new and exciting challenges for organisations and for occupational health services. The ‘Working Late’ network established by the Department of Human Sciences at Loughborough University is ideally placed to develop a major research programme leading to significant developments in understanding older worker requirements. The multidisciplinary research agenda to be developed by the network will ultimately inform future employment policies and lead to significant improvements in occupational health services and the built environment. </p>\n\n<p>The research will explore how employers can provide flexible and dynamic working conditions for older workers and those experiencing mid-life transitions. The role of occupational health services will be investigated to determine how these vital services can be made more consistent across industrial sectors and how they may be more proactive in tailoring occupational health solutions to the workforce. Finally, the research will focus on the design of environments and technologies that accommodate the needs of workers as they age. The implementation of this innovative research agenda will facilitate a transformation of working practices, support services and the built environment, allowing freedom of access to work and improving the quality of working life of older people.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E02050X/1","grantId":"ES/E02050X/1","fundValue":"14594","fundStart":"2006-11-01","fundEnd":"2007-10-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Cheryl  Haslam","coPersons":["Fehmidah  Munir"],"organisation":"Loughborough University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
