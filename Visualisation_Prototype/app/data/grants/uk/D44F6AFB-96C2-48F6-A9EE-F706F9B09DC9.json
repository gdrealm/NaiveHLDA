It is endemic in much of the world, especially in the developing world where its presence restricts the ability to export animal products to disease free countries and so adversely affects rural economies. The virus is one of the most infectious agents known and its ability to cause economic and social havoc was amply demonstrated by the outbreak in the UK in 2001 which cost the country ~&pound;10 billion. Because of the danger of spreading infection only a small number of laboratories world/wide have the containment facilities required to be licensed for work with the disease. This clearly restricts the amount of research that can be conducted, especially on fundamental aspects of the virus and its replication. Recently, equine rhinitis A virus (ERAV) was classified into the same genus, the aphthoviridae, as FMDV on the basis of its genetic similarity. ERAV causes relatively mild symptoms in horses and is not subject to the severe restrictions applied to FMDV and it can be handled in general virology laboratories. In this application we wish to investigate the initial steps of the virus infection process using ERAV in the anticipation that it will be a useful model for FMDV itself. Both ERAV and FMDV are members of the picornavirus family and one of the least well understood steps in the infection process by any of these viruses is how the virus particle is uncoated and transports its RNA genome across the cell membrane to initiate an infection. We have been studying this process, in collaboration with other laboratories, using poliovirus (PV), which is the best understood of all picornaviruses. From this work, a model of how the infection process is achieved by PV is slowly evolving. It appears to be an elegant and sophisticated mechanism involving a series of intermediate particles. However, the known properties of aphthovirus particles mae it difficult to extrapolate the PV model to these viruses. We intend to apply the novel techniques that we have developed in recent years for studying PV to investigate in detail the mechanism of cell entry by ERAV. These methods use artificial lipid membrane structures to mimic cellular membranes in such a way that they can be finely controlled and examined in the laboratory. We will attempt to mimic the infectious process using these systems and examine the intermediate structures formed during the uncoating of the virus and their effects on the properties of the membranes themselves. In this way we hope to gain insight into how the virus uncoats and projects its RNA across an artificial equivalent of a cell membrane. In addition, we will determine the crystal structures of the native virus and potential cell-entry intermediate particles by X-ray diffraction in collaboration with colleagues in Oxford. As we gain a better understanding of the infection process with ERAV we plan to extend the work to include FMDV via our collaborators at the Institute for Animal Health, Pirbright. Although these studies are of immediate academic interest, a better understanding of the infection process may also have more practical value in the longer term. The precise requirements and mechanisms used by viruses are important in determining tissues and species specificity of infection and so are important for understanding host range of the virus. In addition, better understanding of the infectious process can lead to the development of pharmaceutical approaches to interfere with it, as has been shown for HIV.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E00931X/1","grantId":"BB/E00931X/1","fundValue":"318068","fundStart":"2007-06-01","fundEnd":"2010-07-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The research has demonstrated that the cell entry process by viruses belonging to the genus aphthovirus of the family picornaviruses is more complex than had previously been anticipated. In particlular it was shown that transiently stable intermediate structures must be involved in cell entry to explain how the genomic RNA is protected from degredation during this critical process.

Entry is dependent on endocytotic acidification and the viral RNA remains protected from hydrolysis by RNase suggesting that a protective channel is involved in the process of RNA transfer into the cell. Or findings provide the rationalisation for trying to define in molecular terms how a viral RNA transmembrane transfer system is assembled during the infection process.
