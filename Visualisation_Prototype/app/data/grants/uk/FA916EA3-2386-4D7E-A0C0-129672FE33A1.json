{"id":"FA916EA3-2386-4D7E-A0C0-129672FE33A1","title":"Computation-Sensitive Proofs","abstractText":"Proof mining stands for the process of logically analysing formal proofs with the aim of obtaining new (hidden) information from such proofs. For instance, a proof that certain iteration of a function converges to one of its fixed point might have hidden information about the rate at which the sequence converges (rate of convergence), or, a proof that a continuous function has a unique best approximation will normally contain a (potentially implicit) algorithm for constructing the polynomial out of any given function (modulus of uniqueness). The extraction of computational information from ineffective proofs often require a systematic analysis guided by methods of proof theory, such as proof translations and functional interpretations (e.g. realizability). These techniques have recently been shown to yield new interesting mathematical theorems out of old proofs, particularly in functional analysis (approximation theory and fixed point theory). The proposed project aims to develop new proof mining techniques and carry out concrete case studies in both computer science and mathematics, with the emphasis on the role of the structural rule of contraction in the complexity of the extracted programs. We will focus on the recent technique of hybrid functional interpretation which allows optimal use of several functionals interpretations when analysing a single proof. The technique will be implemented in a proof assistant, and case studies will be carried out.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H011803/1","grantId":"EP/H011803/1","fundValue":"101310","fundStart":"2010-01-01","fundEnd":"2011-06-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Paulo  Oliva","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Queen Mary, University of London","findingsText":" The main findings of this project revolve around the relation between different negative translations. Negative translations are language translations between the language of classical mathematics into the language of constructive mathematics. A new negative translation, so-called Peirce translation, was also developed. In joint work with Gilda Ferreira (the RA) we provided a new way of relating negative translations via constructive reductions or &quot;simplifications&quot;. These define an ordering on the translations by saying that a translation T1 is more complex than T2 if T2 can be obtained from T1 via a set of simplifications. Moreover, in related joint work if Martin Escardo we developed a new form of negative translation suited to work in minimal logic (logic without &quot;falsity&quot;). The main application of the extraction of algorithms from mathematical proofs has been in the setting of functional analysis. The techniques developed here can in principle be used to obtain new algorithms to solve computationally functional analysis problems. These are the kind of algorithms that several tools (used both in academia and industry) implement, such as Maple and Matematica. Negative translations are the main tool for making computational sense of proofs in classical mathematics. When extracting an algorithm or construction from a given proof, the first step is generally to apply a negative translation, which automatically transforms a non-constructive theorem into a constructive one. So, main beneficiaries of this research are logicians and mathematicians interested in the link between mathematical theories and computer science algorithms.
