{"id":"8587C0A8-E721-40B3-8A59-1EE48DE043E3","title":"Meeting the challenge of simultaneous talk for cochlear implant users","abstractText":"Although people do not usually talk at the same time, simultaneous speech by two or more speakers is surprisingly frequent. In the typical conversations recorded for our recent AHRC -funded project it occupies 16% of total talking time, 41% of speaker turns being overlapped by another speaker. Simultaneous or overlapping talk is known to be a particular problem for individuals who have a hearing loss, even when using a conventional hearing aid or cochlear implant. Until recently, even in one-to-one settings many users would need optimum conditions in order to hold a satisfactory conversation, e.g. a quiet environment and the communication awareness of both participants that they should avoid talking at the same time. Professionals have steered clear of advising cochlear implant users about how to deal with situations of overlapping talk, on the basis that such a situation would be just too hard to handle. However, recent improvements in the signal processing strategies used in cochlear implants mean that it is now more realistic for users to attempt to engage in conversations where overlapping talk occurs. The aim of this follow-on project is to engage with a group of adult users of cochlear implants in order to develop useful training materials for handling overlapping talk in conversation. These materials will draw mainly on the outputs from our earlier project on overlapping talk, where we have developed a unique corpus and some key findings about overlapping talk in normal conversation. To the best of our knowledge, these will be the first materials that specifically address the problems raised by overlapping talk.\n\nThe main objectives of this project are:\n\n1. To identify the specific issues that overlapping talk raises for cochlear implant users\nThis will be accomplished by direct questioning, via focus group and questionnaire survey; observation of recorded naturalistic conversations; and by exploring linguistic and cultural differences.\n\n2. To develop ways of improving the experience of cochlear implant users\nThis will involve devising training software and activities for cochlear implant users, in close collaboration with a group of cochlear implant users. The idea is that the implant user will be able to work with the materials on their own, and with their family members, at home. The software will make use of real examples from our collection of recorded conversations, where people are quite often talking in overlap. The software will focus on both listening and speaking. On the listening side, for example, it will allow users to simultaneously hear and visualise the flow of a conversation over time, by presenting speaker activity on a graphical timeline. On the speaking side, it will provide learning tasks that allow users to practise producing cues in their own speech.\n\n3. To promote and disseminate the training software through a special event, a dedicated website and through existing channels for cochlear implant users and professionals.\n\nThis project will engage with a small number of cochlear implant users initially, in order to develop software materials that can assist cochlear implant users when dealing with overlapping talk. The project is embedded in the local NHS cochlear implant service, in which two project team members are employed. Initially the outputs of the project will benefit users of that service. They will be disseminated more widely in the UK through the final dissemination event, and through participation in established national meetings for professionals and for cochlear implant users. Other team members will disseminate results at national and international conferences, which will raise awareness of the work within relevant academic communities. The project website will provide global access to the software materials: the project therefore has the potential to enhance the social participation of more than a quarter of a million cochlear implant users worldwide.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/L009307/1","grantId":"AH/L009307/1","fundValue":"78573","fundStart":"2014-03-03","fundEnd":"2015-03-02","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  As this 1 year grant is only 75% completed at the time of writing, we cannot report anything here yet.

This will be accomplished by the following means:\n\na) web-based questionnaire survey of CI users;\n\nThis has been developed through iterative consultation with our user group, and is due to be disseminated in December to a wide network of CI users. \n\n\nb) direct questioning of a focus group of CI users;\n\nFive focus groups sessions have been held so far, with our five CI users. From these we have learnt a great deal about the issues they encounter, as well as individual differences. \n\nc) observation of recorded naturalistic conversations involving CI users and comparison with existing corpus of overlaps in recordings of hearing participants;\n\nThis can only be done informally under the terms of the current grant and permissions. We have nevertheless learnt a lot already from our observation and recording of the Focus group sessions. \n\nd) identifying how linguistic and cultural differences may impinge on the experience of overlapping talk by CI users, by drawing on findings of previous AHRC project.\n\nThis has not been specifically taken forward yet, as our five users are relatively homogeneous in terms of cultural background.\n\n\n2) To devise training software for skill development of CI users in conversational settings:\n\na) in LISTENING to overlapping talk, based on examples of real overlaps collected in the previous AHRC-funded project;\n\nWe have developed several listening tasks and have trialled them with our CI users. We are now in the process of selecting the best ones and moving on to software development\n\nb) in SPEAKING in situations of overlapping talk, drawing on the findings from the AHRC project about how speakers adjust their speech delivery in the context of overlap;\n\nWe have developed speaking tasks and have trialled them with our CI users. We are now moving on to software development\n\n\n\nc) by involving a focus group of CI users iteratively to evaluate the software and advise on its development.\n\nSee 2a and 2b above\n\n3) To promote and disseminate the training software:\na) by working with the focus group members, their families and the professionals who support them;\n\nSo far we have just worked with the CI users themselves.\n\nc) through a special event for local CI users, families and professionals at the end of the project;\nThis will take place in February 2015.\n\nd) through presentations at established fora of CI users and professionals who support them;\nWe have made several presentations at relevant fora for professionals: see publications.\n\ne) through presentations at relevant academic conferences.\nWe have made several presentations at relevant academic meetings : see publications If successful, the training materials will provide an inexpensive yet effective way to improve the experience of CI users worldwide, thus increasing their social participation and quality of life. The proposed project is embedded in the local NHS CI service, which employs two project members. Initially, we are engaging with the users of that service, and they will be the first beneficiaries of the project's outputs. However, the project outputs will be disseminated more widely in the UK through the final engagement event, and through participation in national meetings (e.g., annual conferences of the British Society of Audiology and British Cochlear Implant Group). The project website will provide global access to the software materials. We therefore anticipate that our materials will be used wisely; and we hope that our approach may be adopted by other clinical research groups in different linguistic and cultural contexts.
