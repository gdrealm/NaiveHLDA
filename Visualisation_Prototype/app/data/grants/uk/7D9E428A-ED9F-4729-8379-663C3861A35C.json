These changes lead to decreased mobility, metabolism, independence, quality of life (QoL) and ultimately increased morbidity and mortality. The ultimate objectives of this network therefore, are to improve the quality of life of an increasingly ageing population by tackling issues of muscle wasting and frailty associated with a lack of adequate exercise and nutrition. </p> \n<p>We aim to advance our understanding of the dynamics of ageing from a molecular/endocrine perspective and to evaluate the impact that exercise and nutrition have on this process across social and economic backgrounds.&nbsp;Derived data together with essential input from our older populations will be used to devise exercise/nutrition or therapeutic interventions which will enhance muscle mass and function and therefore improve the QoL of said population.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Finally, we intend to develop new policies targeted directly at this population group in order that nutrition and exercise become a way of healthy older life.&nbsp; We propose to explore how individual influences (physiology, cell biology, endocrinology, lifestyle and socio-economic background) over the life-course, affect successful ageing and the interaction between chronological and biological age.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-351-25-0136","grantId":"RES-351-25-0136","fundValue":"16264","fundStart":"2006-11-01","fundEnd":"2007-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Claire  Stewart","coPersons":["Gladys Leopoldine Onambele-Pearson"],"organisation":"Manchester Metropolitan University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
