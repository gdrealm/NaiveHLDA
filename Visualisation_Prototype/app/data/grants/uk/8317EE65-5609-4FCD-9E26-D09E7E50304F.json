To date, therefore, impact has been purely scientific. \n\nThis was anticipated in our original proposal, which underlined the abstract nature of the research and suggested societal impacts would likely flow only in the medium and long term once our scientific findings were in the public domain and had permeated into related debates.\n\nWe are committed to seeing these impacts flow over the medium and longer term. To this end we have a social media campaign planned to co-incide with the release of our monograph. We also have plans for future research that will take the core findings of our research into more applied debates (e.g. about policy learning).  ","person":"John Robert Hudson","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of York","findingsText":" Our project aimed to explore big picture questions such as:\n\n* Does (national) 'culture matter' in explaining cross-national differences in welfare state provision?\n* Do different countries have different societal values that might act as a proxy for differences in culture? \n* Can we measure such differences empirically? \n* Do these differences help explain why different policy choices are being made in different countries? \n\nFour broad findings emerged from our analysis.\n\nThe first was that our previously developed method for eliciting societal values proved to be robust when extended and updated with the addition of the latest (fourth) wave of European Values Study (EVS) and World Values Survey (WVS) data to our pooled data set. Given that our method is based on the identification of broadly stable patterns of societal values the addition of data from this fourth wave provided a key test of the veracity of earlier work. The addition of an extra wave of data from each survey did not undermine the core findings produced in earlier research and there was a good degree of crossover in terms of the examples of societal values extracted whether using three or four waves of data. \n\nSecondly, and following from the above, we extracted six examples of societal values that overlapped heavily with those found in our earlier work, but with some refinements and two additional values around political participation identified. We labelled the eight examples of societal values we identified as: religiosity; conservative social norms; permissive values on adherence to laws; optimistic values; traditional family values; inter-personal tolerance; political activeness; and, political orientedness.\n\nThirdly, and perhaps most fundamentally, we found strong empirical support for the 'culture matters' thesis when using proxies for policy decisions (levels of spending, policy structures) as dependent variables and, along with data on the economic, political and institutional context, our examples of societal values as independent variables in regression models. Inclusion of the cultural context improved the explanatory power of our models in a meaningful way.\n\nFourthly, in looking to add a cultural component to models of welfare state ideal types we found there was no clear and easy way to integrate our examples of societal values into existing ideal types in a meaningful way. Indeed, we concluded that the suggestion we would do so in our original proposal was based on flawed thinking that societal values would in some way neatly overlay with welfare state ideal types and might be usefully subsumed within them. Instead we found quite complex patterns of societal values that often operated very independently from welfare state types. Not only did this provide still stronger evidence for the culture matters thesis, but raised intriguing questions about how welfare states and societal values interact. We found that experimental multi-step fuzzy set methods provided a useful tool for exploring these interactions. For instance, while the strength of traditional family values seemed unimportant in explaining policy interventions in social democratic regimes they were much more significant in liberal regimes. For academic audiences, publication of our monograph is the first step: its core argument is culture deserves a more central focus in welfare regime debates, but it also offers some methodological advances and suggestions for future study. Additional outputs will follow and, in particular, we aim to use the research as a springboard into debates on the barriers to cross-national policy learning (a paper has already been presented on this) and about the role of changing societal values in fostering social policy change (the monograph points to some key cases here).\n\nNon-academic audiences will have an interest in both of these new areas. It is recognized that policies cannot be easily transferred between countries with very different contexts and our work may help develop methods to match countries that are similar enough to allow for movement of policy ideas. This aspect of the work will likely appeal to organisations engaged in comparative policy evaluations designed to select examples of international best practice. By contrast, it is campaigning organisations that are likely to be most interested in the work on how shifting societal values may foster social policy change: political parties, pressure groups and think tanks may find this dimension of our work of use.
