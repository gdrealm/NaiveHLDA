Early identification and remediation of these common developmental disorders are critical to alleviating the long-term human suffering they cause; understanding their genetic and environmental origins is a major part of achieving these goals. \n\nSince 1995, MRC programme grant G9424799 has created the premier twin study of the genetics of learning difficulties and behaviour problems in childhood, called the Twins Early Development Study (TEDS). TEDS includes 7500 pairs of twins assessed at 2, 3, 4, and 7 years of age, with DNA available for more than 10,000 children. TEDS findings have led to new ways of thinking about the genetic and environmental origins of learning disabilities and behaviour problems in childhood, most notably a ?generalist genes? theory of learning disabilities and abilities. These findings have charted the course for molecular genetic research that has begun to identify genes responsible for the substantial genetic influence on these disorders.\n\nThe proposed 5-year study will capitalise on the unique TEDS dataset by following the twins into adolescence using extensive web-based tests and interviews of 5000 twin pairs at 12 and 14 years of age. We will identify DNA markers (single-nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs) associated with these learning disabilities and behaviour problems using an innovative strategy developed in TEDS -- genotyping DNA pooled across groups on microarrays that genotype more than 500,000 DNA markers. Although each DNA marker will have a small effect, multiple DNA markers can be aggregated in what we call a ?SNP-set.? \n\nThe proposed research will identify a SNP-set for general learning difficulties (mild mental impairment, MMI). The SNP-set will be uniquely useful as an index of genetic risk in behavioural genomic research that focuses on the interplay between genes and environment as they affect children?s behavioural development. Although MMI ultimately needs to be understood at all levels of analysis from genes to brain to behaviour, behavioural genomic research will produce gene-based diagnoses that could lead to individually tailored treatments. Most importantly, SNP sets can lead to early prediction of children at risk and thus facilitate research on environmental and behavioural interventions that prevent the onset of these disorders.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0500079","grantId":"G0500079","fundValue":"1470410","fundStart":"2005-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Robert  Plomin","coPersons":[],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
