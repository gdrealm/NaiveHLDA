The various activities, starting from patient referral through to the delivery of the appropriate treatment, form a complex system, for which generating a high quality planning and scheduling solution is a challenging real-world problem that significantly impacts on healthcare staff and patients.This ambitious research proposal concerns both the generation of possible radiotherapy treatments, for patients and the scheduling of resources. This is a joint research proposal between two research groups from the University of Nottingham and Coventry University with expertise from differing but complementary disciplines. Two large hospitals, Nottingham City Hospital and the UHCW NHS Trust in Coventry, which are both providing radiotherapy treatment to a large population throughout their respective regions, are acting as collaborators on the project. They will provide real-world data and expertise in the domain of radiotherapy treatment. The proposed research requires a multidisciplinary effort, aiming at combining different operational research and artificial intelligence disciplines within a complex real-world medical environment.A successful outcome to the proposed research would significantly improve the efficiency and the quality of radiotherapy treatment in the UK. It could lead to a reduction of waiting time and waiting lists for treatments, a reduction of stress levels in patients and improved consistency in terms of dose delivery. Most Important of all, it has a definite potential to increase the survival rate of cancer patients","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/C54952X/1","grantId":"EP/C54952X/1","fundValue":"215736","fundStart":"2006-02-20","fundEnd":"2009-07-19","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The hospitals expressed a high level of interest in the results achieved throughout the project. They were provided with a prototype software package for radiotherapy scheduling.  ","person":"Dobrila  Petrovic","coPersons":["Colin Richard  Reeves"],"organisation":"Coventry University","findingsText":" Different approaches to scheduling of radiotherapy pretreatment and treatment appointments were developed considering various medical and scheduling constraints and different objectives, such as minimisation of number of patients who do not meet their waiting time targets, minimisation of usage of overtime slots, minimisation of machines idle time, and so on. Motivated by heuristics developed for production scheduling problems, novel heuristics-based methods were developed for four unites that comprised the whole radiotherapy process. Another approach was based on genetic algorithms (GAs) which optimised the whole radiotherapy process .\nDifferent experiments were carried out to analyse the performance of the two radiotherapy scheduling approaches. It was shown that both approaches created schedules of good performance with respect to waiting times and percentages of late patients of different categories. Radiotherapy scheduling problems can be adapted and modified for other problems of patient scheduling, in particular those where meeting the waiting time targets is of interest.\nFurther on, the developed models and approaches can be applied to a variety of scheduling problems which are characterised by the presence of multiple resource types, dynamic arrivals of tasks/activities/jobs to be scheduled, different importance of tasks/activities/jobs, various types of uncertainties that are inherent in real-world scheduling and multiple criteria to measure the quality of schedules.
