{"id":"D12EA0CA-0623-421C-942B-D01A72ECE1E6","title":"Extreme Reasoning","abstractText":"Queen Mary is a world-leading centre for research on logical methods for reasoning about computer systems. Our work has spearheaded several developments -- separation logic, logic for continuous systems, information theory for security, process types for web services -- in which novel theoretical developments by us have been brought to bear in new application areas. The purpose of this platform grant is to provide us with continuity support as we pursue the strategic development of our research. It will also be used for risky, adventurous pilot projects that could lead on to wholly new lines of research, and feasibility studies that will possibly lead on to further industrial applications of mathematical logic.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F02309X/1","grantId":"EP/F02309X/1","fundValue":"759553","fundStart":"2008-01-15","fundEnd":"2012-07-14","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter  O'Hearn","coPersons":["Kohei  Honda","Paulo  Oliva","Ursula Hilda Mary Martin","Paul  Curzon","Pasquale  Malacaria"],"organisation":"Queen Mary, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
