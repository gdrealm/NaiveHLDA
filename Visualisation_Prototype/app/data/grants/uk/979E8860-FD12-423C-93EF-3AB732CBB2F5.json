The cultural, social and emotional implications of natural burial.","abstractText":"<p>This project investigates changing approaches to the disposal of the human body, focussing on the expansion of 'natural burial' provision in the UK since 1993. This provides a case study which now encompasses over 200 sites. The work is multidisciplinary, combining anthropological and sociological questions about religion, death ritual, landscape and nature with landscape architecture's perspectives on the management and usage of the natural environment. It asks what the trend towards natural burial reveals about belief systems and practices around death in the UK. </p> \n<p>Questions include: </p> \n<ul> \n <li>Do the ecological implications of natural burial make it a focus for more collective responses to death? <br /><br /></li> \n <li>Or is natural burial an indicator of a post-modern trend towards individualised life style options, another item of consumption used to sustain particular identities? <br /><br /></li> \n <li>Do the values which natural burial represents have positively perceived yet vague meanings which unite individuals within an apparently cohesive ‘Movement’ - for example, ethical concerns for the environment, ecology, nature as a site for emotional solace? </li>\n</ul> \n<p>The research methodology will include surveying a selection of natural burial grounds in order to establish taxonomy of natural burial and interviews with users, local residents and death care professionals.</p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E016790/1","grantId":"ES/E016790/1","fundValue":"302986","fundStart":"2007-06-25","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"A  Clayden","coPersons":["J  Hockey"],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
