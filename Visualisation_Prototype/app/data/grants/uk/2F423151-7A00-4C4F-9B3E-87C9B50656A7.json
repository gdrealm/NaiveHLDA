This proposal will lead to the development of the camera system for the flight model instrument and the provision of scientific support to the programme. The proposal draws on major UK strengths in CCD technology, custom flight electronics design and also world leadership in the detection of life signatures using Raman spectroscopy.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/F006462/1","grantId":"ST/F006462/1","fundValue":"92949","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Ian  Hutchinson","coPersons":["David Ryan Smith"],"organisation":"Brunel University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
