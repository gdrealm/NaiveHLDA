{"id":"9E1F65D0-E957-4CBC-9BA4-C36062FE16FA","title":"Obesity surgery: a clinical ethnography","abstractText":"This research is an ethnographic study of an obesity surgery clinic in a large NHS hospital. The research aims to explore the ways in which obesity and its surgical treatment are constructed, negotiated and enacted in the clinical setting. This will be achieved by observing consultations between patients and clinicians over a one-year period, as well as through interviews with patients, family members and carers, and clinicians. The research will explore: the ways in which the different actors in the clinic conceptualise obesity; how patients come to identify as candidates for surgery; how patients and clinicians negotiate the risks and benefits of surgery; how treatment success and failure are defined and marked; how the interactions between patients and clinicians change over time; and the ways in which gender, race and class impact upon the experience of obesity surgery for both patients and clinicians. The analysis is anticipated to offer insights into the experience of extreme obesity and its surgical treatment in a social and cultural context which actively repudiates the fat body, as well as providing a productive site from which to investigate core sociological issues including risk, responsibility, identity, stigma, expertise, and power relations in health care.\n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F031882/1","grantId":"ES/F031882/1","fundValue":"31050","fundStart":"2008-05-01","fundEnd":"2009-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Karen  Throsby","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
