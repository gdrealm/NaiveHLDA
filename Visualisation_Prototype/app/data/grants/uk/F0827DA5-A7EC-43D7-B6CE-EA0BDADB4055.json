The study will assess both central control options and engaging information sharing coupled with participative management decision making as means for reducing consumption. The study will propose and test an optimal combination of the two approaches.Additional outcomes will include future network sustainability forecasts, user behaviour predictions and novel consumption management strategies.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I00016X/1","grantId":"EP/I00016X/1","fundValue":"348901","fundStart":"2011-03-01","fundEnd":"2013-11-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"David  Hutchison","coPersons":["Andreas Ulrich Mauthe","Ian William Marshall","Rebecca  Ellis"],"organisation":"Lancaster University","findingsText":" This project showed that energy saving is a matter not just of technology measures but perhaps more importantly of persuading people to change their usage habits. The work was conducted by a team of technologists and social scientists. The work led to the recruitment by Lancaster University of an energy manager whose role is to deploy appropriate energy measuring technology but also to help change user habits -- persuading them to think about using less energy in offices.
