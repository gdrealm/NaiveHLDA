In this research we aim to apply and further develop new theory and innovative methods to explore and explain the role of disadvantage in crime causation.</p>\n\n<p>Guided by Situational Action Theory, and using unique data about young people and their environments from the longitudinal Peterborough Adolescent and Young Adult Development Study (PADS+), including data drawn from a new wave of data to be collected during early adulthood, we will investigate how young people’s social lives vary in relation to their levels of social disadvantage as a consequence of processes of social and self-selection. We hypothesise that if social disadvantage has an impact on young people’s crime and criminal careers (eg, onset, duration and desistence) this may be primarily because disadvantage-induced selection processes are likely to place disadvantaged young people more often than others in developmental contexts that are conducive to the development of a higher crime propensity, and in action contexts in which acts of crime tend to be encouraged (or at least are not strongly discouraged). As far as we know, this aspect of the role of disadvantage in crime causation has never been properly theorised and empirically studied and will break new ground in the understanding of the disadvantage-crime relationship.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K010646/1","grantId":"ES/K010646/1","fundValue":"1336210","fundStart":"2014-01-16","fundEnd":"2017-01-15","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  The main application of our findings so far is to advance knowledge about the causes of crime.

It builds upon existing interdisciplinary knowledge and aims to address persistent shortcomings in explanations of crime. The Peterborough Adolescent and Young Adult Study (PADS+), as well as numerous international replication studies with which it collaborates, have provided strong evidence in favour of SAT and its core premise that crime is the outcome of an interaction between personal and environmental factors. Using innovative methods, PADS+ has been able to show for the first time that crimes happen only when people with a high crime propensity interact with criminogenic settings, and have advanced knowledge about the key factors which underlie crime propensity and make settings criminogenic. We are now analysing the role of social disadvantage in crime causation within the framework of SAT and have posited that the key mechanism is selection, not causation, which we have subsequently empirically supported. There are many elements of SAT which can be applied to analysing the link between social disadvantage and crime involvement, which is our key aim over the next few years. This can also be assessed cross-nationally through ongoing replication studies with interesting implications for understanding the differences in rates of crime across different socioeconomic and cultural contexts. This ultimately has implications for crime prevention policies and practices. Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice,Other","dataset":"gtr"}
