{"id":"B73E0874-7FED-425B-8CEE-CE407680097F","title":"Protein interactions and compartmentalisation in cell signalling","abstractText":"At the molecular level diseases are caused by failures of cellular control systems. These control systems are organised in protein networks that generate specific biological responses through combinatorial interactions between the components. In order to understand the function of these control networks we need to identify their components and how they interact with each other. This is now possible through modern technologies such as proteomics for protein identification at high speed and sensitivity, and the microscopic imaging of protein interactions. Having successfully established these technologies we want to use them in this research project to analyse the interaction network formed by three important cellular control systems (GPCR, cAMP, ERK). These three control systems are subverted in a great variety of diseases including inflammation, cancer, infection, cardiovascular and neurological disorders. Elucidating how these control systems interact will further our understanding of the molecular changes that cause disease and is expected to lead to the identification of novel molecular targets for drugs and therapeutic intervention. Ultimately, this will lead to better therapies.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0400053","grantId":"G0400053","fundValue":"480774","fundStart":"2005-01-05","fundEnd":"2008-07-04","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Walter  Kolch","coPersons":["Graeme  Milligan","Andrew Robert Pitt","Miles Douglas Houslay"],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
