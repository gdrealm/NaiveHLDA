Regulations decree that the production of animal products is free from zoonoses that can affect humans. Food producers wish to avoid the costs associated with other animal diseases. Regulatory authorities wish to reduce the cost of testing, especially visual inspection at slaughterhouses. Building on solid scientific and commercial research evidence resulting from a recently completed TSB GRD-funded project, this project now aims to take MagSer (i.e.a serology test for zoonoses and animal diseases) from Proof of Principle (PoP) to a fully developed instrument and suite of assays for screening animal diseases and zoonoses. The novelty and advantage of MagSer lies in the unique combination of immuno-magnetic capture of paramagnetic particles (beads) with highly sensitive magnetometer instrumentation to detect and quantify antibodies captured on the beads. The main innovations will be the a disposable measurement technology directly applicable to the measurement of antigen specific antibodies in pig's blood and the development of a rapid, low cost and simple device that can be used at point of test to screen animals for infections and check for efficacy of vaccination. Assay development work is planned at UWE's labs with instrument and consumable development and assay integration and validation being carried out by Clarity Biosolutions Ltd. (CBL).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/L011360/1","grantId":"BB/L011360/1","fundValue":"293339","fundStart":"2013-09-01","fundEnd":"2015-08-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Project still not completed so no impacts have been recorded as yet.  ","person":"Janice  Kiely","coPersons":["Richard William Luxton"],"organisation":"University of the West of England","findingsText":" To date this project has delivered a new magneto-immunoassay based detection device and associated test consumables for the detection of animal diseases and zoonoses in pigs. Measurements have shown that the system is capable of detecting required targets at relevant levels within samples. The aim is for the device to be used in the food and veterinary industries and important considerations during the development process have been to ensure the device is robust, portable and cost effective. Suc The aim is to develop a technology that can detect animal disease and zoonoses. It is hoped therefore that others, for example veterinarians and farmers will use the findings of the work.\nThe technology is adaptable to other application areas and the learning within this project can help to accelerate development of the technology for other application areas.\nThe measurements carried out on real samples can be used to provide greater understanding of animal diseases and zoonoses.
