In Britain, this global problem has found recent expression in debates about the efficacy of multiculturalism and the creation of community cohesion. Such discourse comes to ground most visibly in the urban arena, where socially polarised communities co-habit cities. Interestingly, while controversy around ethnicities and cohesion is current in places like Britain, there has been a parallel debate in Northern Ireland for the past 40 years. </p>\n\n<p>This action-research project, based at the School of Planning, Architecture &amp; Civil Engineering and involving the Warwick Business School, addresses the relevance of Belfast’s experience of building community capacity amid inter-communal strife for the English challenge of creating sustainable social space, rooted in greater inter-culturalism and ‘community cohesion’. </p>\n\n<p>The project will work in partnership with local organisations in the selected communities and will employ a participatory action research approach, ie where people in the community actively participate with the researcher throughout the lifespan of the project. The methodology will also involve a baseline assessment of existing community infrastructure, the development of sustainable community plans and an evaluation of the project’s impact.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E024122/1","grantId":"ES/E024122/1","fundValue":"47554","fundStart":"2007-04-01","fundEnd":"2008-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Frank  Gaffikin","coPersons":["Kenneth Walter Sterrett","John  Mawson"],"organisation":"Queen's University of Belfast","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
