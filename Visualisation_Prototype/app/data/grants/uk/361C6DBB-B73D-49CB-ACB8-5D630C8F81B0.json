{"id":"361C6DBB-B73D-49CB-ACB8-5D630C8F81B0","title":"Sensors for the field-detection of radionuclides in water","abstractText":"We propose to develop a sensor for the field-detection of radionuclides, specifically 99Tc in groundwater and waste discharges from nuclear related sites. This Pathfinder proposal aims to evaluate the market receptivity of a sensor of this nature and provide an opportunity to explore commercial and end users partnerships for its development. In power plants and other nuclear related sites, such as Sellafield in the UK, the monitoring of radionuclides in water has to be performed regularly to ensure the protection of the workforce and neighbouring communities. The monitoring requires collecting large quantities of water by manual sampling and analysing them after they have been transported to laboratory facilities. To simplify this process, we have developed polymeric compounds that can selectively retain 99TcO4- from water at low concentration, using chemical affinity for this ion in solution. The proposed sensor harnesses the ability of these polymer compounds to selectively retain 99Tc from water in order to concentrate this radionuclide from solution and allow its in situ quantification (i.e. analysis can be performed on site) using a radiation detector. By integrating existing reliable technology with newly synthesized polymeric matrices we are creating the next generation of portable sensors for the field detection of radionuclides in contaminated sites. The activities proposed in this Pathfinder will strengthen knowledge of the sensors market size and provide an opportunity to involve end users and regulators via close interactions with current project partners Practical Controls Ltd and Environmental Monitoring Solutions Ltd. These are essential steps to building a sound foundation for our future Follow on project from a technical and market perspective; ensuring that future applications are attractive to end users and that commercial interest can be secured.\nKeywords: portable radionuclide sensor, nuclear contamination, groundwater, pollution &amp; waste management.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/M02153X/1","grantId":"NE/M02153X/1","fundValue":"12290","fundStart":"2015-03-25","fundEnd":"2015-09-24","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Maria  Romero-Gonzalez","coPersons":["Patrick James Smith"],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
