From without, stambeli is understood as 'African', meaning non-Tunisian, sub-Saharan, and other. From within, however, stambeli ritually negotiates the encounter between sub-Saharan and North Africa's by invoking Black Spirits (sub-Saharan) and White Saints (North African), who heal and make their presence known through ritualised trance. \nMy research will finalise my ethno musicological fieldwork on stambeli in order to complete a monograph on music, spirit possession, and the geo-cultural imagination in North Africa, and to produce the first audio recordings of stambeli.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=119581/1","grantId":"119581/1","fundValue":"9996","fundStart":"2006-02-24","fundEnd":"2006-11-23","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Richard Charles Jankowsky","coPersons":[],"organisation":"School of Oriental & African Studies","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
