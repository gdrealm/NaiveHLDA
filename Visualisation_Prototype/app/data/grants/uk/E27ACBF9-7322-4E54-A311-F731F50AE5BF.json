{"id":"E27ACBF9-7322-4E54-A311-F731F50AE5BF","title":"Theory of badly approximable sets","abstractText":"A given real number can be approximated by rational numbers with an arbitrary precision. For example the decimal representation of a number provides such an approximation. On the other hand different numbers are approximated by rationals with different speed in terms of the denominators of that rational numbers. There is no upper bound for that speed which was firstly mentioned by Liouville in 1840's. On the other hand there is a natural lower bound for that speed which is determined by Dirichlet-Hurwitz theorems. It says that for any irrational number x one can find infinitely many rational numbers p/q such that\n\n|x - p/q| &lt; 1/q^2.\n\nMoreover there exist irrational numbers which make this inequality sharp. In other words for that numbers the distance |x-p/q| can not be made smaller than c/q^2 for some positive constant c and all rational numbers p/q. Irrational real numbers with such property are called badly approximable.\n\nThe set of badly approximable numbers can be described quite well with help of the theory of continued fractions. It allows us to derive a lot of information about that set: it's &quot;size&quot; in terms of Lebesgue's measure and Hausdorff dimension and some other information about its structure.\n\nIn two-dimensional case and more generally in high dimensional case we can also approximate any point in R^n by points with rational coefficients. However different coordinates can be approximated by rationals with their own speed. Because of this phenomena, in higher dimensions we have an uncountable family of different sets of badly approximable points depending on the relative speed of approximation of different coordinates of the point.\n\nThe structure of the sets of badly approximable points in high dimensions is much less known than their one-dimensional analogue. It incorporates a lot of open problems. Some of them like famous Littlewood conjecture attract a lot of attention of the modern mathematical society. In this project I am going to shed the light on many of that problems.\n\nOne of the main objectives of this project is to construct the mechanism which, like continued fractions in one dimension, will help us to deal with badly approximable points easier. This work has already been started by me together with Velani and Pollington. We described the sets which allowed us to solve a number of related problems including the famous Schmidt conjecture.\n\nNext, the mechanism of generalized Cantor sets will be used to solve some particular open problems about badly approximable points in n-dimensional real space. In particular the structure of BAD points on manifolds in arbitrary dimensions will be investigated.\n\nFinally some new approaches will be applied to attack the famous Littlewood conjecture. It was stated by Littlewood in 1931 and nowadays it is one of the most attractive problems in modern Mathematics.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/L005204/1","grantId":"EP/L005204/1","fundValue":"97180","fundStart":"2013-10-08","fundEnd":"2015-10-07","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  It is ongoing research. Many of the findings will become publicly available in the next year.\nHowever as far as I know specialists in Diophantine approximation already use my results in their research. These results are available through the free arxiv repository and also they were shared in several conferences.\nConcerning the impact of my research out of the academy, the research I'm doing is purely theoretical. Historically this type of research provided the first step towards the production of the science intensive technology. So it has a high potential for long term impact.

It enabled me to solve several open problems which were in the focus of specialists in Diophantine Approximations. The work is still under way however it is going to lead to one or two publications in the high quality Math. journals.\nConcerning another project objective - Littlewood conjecture - \nI together with my colleagues Bugeaud, Einsiedler and Kleinbock managed to significantly advance in solving the p-adic analogue of it. Recently I submitted three papers on this topic. All of them are under peer revision process.\nFinally, I recently completed two small related projects with my collaborators: Zorin and Hussain. They resulted in one paper each. The paper with Zorin has already been accepted, another one is still being written. The immediate beneficiar of the results of my research is the academic society in general and more precisely such disciplines as analytical numbers theory, Dynamical systems, measure and probability. \nSets of badly approximable numbers and their analogues recently attract a lot of attention among these disciplines.
