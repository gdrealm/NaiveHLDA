This is partly because state ownership of corporations is still common. Corrupt and non-transparent decision making by these corporations is commonplace. In this atmosphere the prospect of foreign transnational corporations taking a decisive role in large infrastructure projects has been welcomed by policy makers in the region. This project seeks to assess whether this attitude is naive given the possibility that significant environmental damage may be caused by such projects. In order to assess the danger of this happening the project will examine the environmental laws and regulations to discover if they are EU compliant and sufficiently robust to withstand the dangers of environmental damage at this critical time and whether the procedures in place for the involvement of the public and civil society organisations comply with human rights standards.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/E509673/1","grantId":"AH/E509673/1","fundValue":"206935","fundStart":"2007-09-01","fundEnd":"2011-04-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Janet  DineAdam  Fagan","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Queen Mary, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
