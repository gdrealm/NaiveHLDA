Textiles, culture and identity in the Andes: a semiotic and ontological approach.","abstractText":"In place of writing, textiles in Andean civilizations were developed over millennia by visually literate populations to document and display complex data. Academic studies worldwide are intrigued by this massive cultural use of information display, yet limited in methods of approach. Drawing on new methodologies combining fieldwork, digital documentation, information visualization and ontology, this project develops a common language for understanding Andean cloth to be shared between Visual, Computer and Museum Studies. \\n\\nResearch to date has established that textiles bear messages. Some are understood; others are still inaccessible due to the incomplete data sets available for scrutiny, discontinuous time sequences of samples, and limited correlation with comparative materials from the ethnographic and historical record, and commentaries from living weavers. To overcome this, we opt for regional rather than local sampling procedures to give us greater access to materials, while our interdisciplinary approach promotes greater sample contextualization. \\n\\nThrough data mining and other web-based techniques, this wider sample contextualization will be articulated to a digital structural mapping of cloth. Our hypothesis is that weaving techniques, as conservative organising features, have ontological associations that can be mapped in a working grammar of textile design, and correlated with socio-cultural and historical data. Centred in a weaver's perspective, our approach goes beyond the analysis of surface features of cloth to give precedence to its technical and structural properties. Existing software, adapted to express Andean cloth's 3D nature, will feed into our database design, together with digital photos, video and text data. Our interface design gives priority to content-oriented access, and a graphical concept browser, to express this weaving perspective visually.\\n\\nDatabase documentation, building on the site at the Centre for Iberian and Latin American Visual Studies, Birkbeck College London (bbk.ac.uk/cilavs), will systematize visual textile information, permitting academic disciplines an ontology-based exploration of weaving structures that map the social semiotic relations between cultural practices and identities. Workshops with curators of European and Latin American collections will coordinate information collection, methods, and analysis. \\n\\nThe main project stages of data collection, analysis and organisation, articulated to innovative means of access and analysis, have broad cognitive and curatorial goals. A secondary applied aspect responds to concerns of regional weavers to defend their cultural patrimony from piracy, and introduce local weaving repertories into new educational curricula. Our software and database design will respond to both these needs. \\n\\nResearch context\\nResearch in Bolivia, Peru and Chile, combined with museum research there and in the UK, focuses on 3 regions on the basis of previous ethnographic, archaeological and museological knowledge and contacts, and 3 time horizons: Tiwanaku, the Inka-early colony, and the contemporary.\\n\\nThis study is urgent. As a result of former educational trends, ignoring regional textile production in favour of an emerging global textile industry, modern forms of literacy, and out-migration from rural communities, younger generations no longer want to weave. Current NGO interventions too are changing regional design repertories, and hence historical continuities and identity questions. At the same time, contemporary politics are generating alternative educational demands that seek new identity-based curricula in a decolonizing context. Our ethnographic research concerns the cultural rescue of endangered weaving practices, while providing new methods to document and link them to emerging industries.\\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/G012180/1","grantId":"AH/G012180/1","fundValue":"853885","fundStart":"2009-07-01","fundEnd":"2013-06-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  'Weaving Communities of Practice' has made a substantial impact on cultural life by creating new systems of cataloguing and digitising collections of Andean textiles and developing a digital, online database to manage complex visual information.

The project has successfully demonstrated the value of combining historical, museological, archaeological, computer science and ethnographic research in order to understand the structures and techniques of Andean textiles especially from the weaver's point of view. \n\n2. The project has brought to light a significant archive of Andean textiles, scattered in disparate museums and other collections around the world. Using a sophisticated digital database, these have comprehensively documented and made this available via an open website. Some 300 archaeological textiles (ca. 600-1532 AD), 50 historical textiles (1532-1900), and 200 ethnographic textiles (1901-present) were documented. \n\n3. The project has demonstrated the contributions that contemporary weavers can make to the research process. Our textile experts wove 160 models of specific techniques evident in the museum examples to check how the techniques might have been woven in practice. This enabled significant progress in identifying and systematising knowledge of textile structures and techniques. \n\n4. The project demonstrated the value of developing specialist software programmes (namely Sawu-3D and InaSawu) which enhance the documentation of textile structures, techniques and iconography, especially the 3D nature of cloth\n\n5. The project has demonstrated the benefit of systematic documentation of textile collections, linking them to wider economic, environmental and cultural contexts, and making them available through a website underpinned by an innovative knowledge base system, allowing a greater range of questions to be asked of the material\n\n6. The project has made significant new contributions to the understanding of the history and technology of weaving and spinning in the Andean region, demonstrating in particular the vitality and diversity of pre-Columbian textile production and its continuing legacies today. The project was designed specifically to produce materials and applications of use to museum and heritage sector professionals, Andean textile producers and public audiences interested in textile culture, design and history.\n\n1. Museum &amp;amp;amp; heritage sector professionals \nThe project seeks to expand knowledge of textile structure, by creating new terminology and means of textile identification, and providing a new basis for cataloguing, understanding and valuing museum textiles. Museums in Bolivia, Chile, Argentina and Peru have already benefitted from software, training and advice, and the project has the potential to influence heritage policy in Bolivia in particular. Museums in the UK and elsewhere will also benefit by the increased accessibility and enhanced quality of documentation about their collections.\n\n2. Andean textile producers\nWeavers in rural communities in the Andean region are potential beneficiaries of knowledge concerning ancient weaving instruments, techniques used for shearing alpacas and llamas and for spinning their wool into finer threads, use of traditional natural dyes, and the meaning of terms in Quechua and Aymara related to specific weaving techniques and structures. Textile production remains an important source of income for rural communities.\n\n3. Non-academic public audiences\nThe project seeks to increase public awareness, in Latin America and the UK, of the sophistication and impact of pe-Columbian textile production, and so to highlight the economic and cultural contribution of weaving communities in the Andean region today. Making information concerning textile design and structure more widely available will also have potential applications in the creative and cultural sectors.
