We will investigate a novel concept which uses a helical corrugation on the inside surface of a 'cylindrical' waveguide to radically modify the wave dispersion giving eigenmodes with finite, constant group velocity in the region of near infinite phase velocity. This novel dispersion opens up for the first time the potential for a high power (5kW), broadband (10%), high gain &gt;40dB, efficient (30%) gyrotron amplifier in the 90GHz to 100GHz frequency range and above. We have performed a preliminary experiment at X-band (8GHz to 10GHz) frequencies and will build on our lead to create an amplifier in the W-band (90GHz to 100GHz) frequency band based on the best understanding of this new concept and perform precision measurements of its gain, bandwidth, efficiency and stability against oscillations. New theory and computational models benchmarked against W-band experimental data will be used to demonstrate the potential for this novel amplifier to generate high frequency (360GHz to 400GHz and 460GHz to 500GHz), high power (~0.5kW), broadband (10%), pulsed and continuous coherent radiation crucially needed by the many known applications.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G036659/1","grantId":"EP/G036659/1","fundValue":"771109","fundStart":"2009-04-01","fundEnd":"2013-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Radiation sources and amplifiers, in the spectral region from microwave to terahertz, are extensively used in UK industry and public sectors such as security, defence, health and the environment. Companies, including e2v Technologies plc. (e2v) and TMD Technologies Ltd. (TMD), have developed and sold new radiation products based on post-1996 research undertaken at the University of Strathclyde. Their devices accessed new frequency ranges with considerable increases in power and bandwidth. The designs were transferred to industry, where devices have been constructed, jobs created, policy changed and considerable investments made. These sources have had extensive beneficial impact through applications in defence, surveillance, materials processing, health sciences and environmental monitoring. \n.

The corresponding gyro-amplifier has been designed and is under construction and measurement with the prospect of successful operation during 2013. The foundations have also been laid for further extension of these sources to even higher operating frequencies. Follow-on research projects involving applications of these novel sources in biomedical research and weather radars is starting. The results of this gyro-device research can be applied in improving NMR sensitivity for biomedical research and in future cloud radars.
