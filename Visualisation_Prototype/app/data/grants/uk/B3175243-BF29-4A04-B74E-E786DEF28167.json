These operators have some properties that are seen in both differential and difference operators but also have entirely new charecteristics.We have comenced a research programme that studies the eigenvaluebranches and other spectral questions for these operators (see case for suport) and we request travel funds for two one month visits to Cardiff for the VF to further this research.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D03096X/1","grantId":"EP/D03096X/1","fundValue":"2290","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2008-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The outputs have been used as the b axis for academic talks Electronics Cultural","person":"B Malcolm Brown","coPersons":["Karl Michael  Schmidt"],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":" new spectral properties which seem to be a feature of this type of operator It would be interesting to see the class of operators that have these properties Electronics","dataset":"gtr"}
