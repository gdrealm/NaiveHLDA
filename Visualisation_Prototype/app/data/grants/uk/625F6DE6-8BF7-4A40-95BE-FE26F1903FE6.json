The role of crowds in driving large-scale social change has become increasingly central to both social psychology and social anthropology, though these research traditions remain distinct. </p>\n\n<p>This research brings together researchers in crowd behaviour and identity from both disciplines to examine how public displays of national identity represent and transform the ways in which the national community is imagined. </p>\n\n<p>This project investigates the role of collective events in the formation of Irishness. Using iconically Irish events&nbsp;- St. Patrick's Day celebrations and the 1916 Easter Rising commemorations&nbsp;- it will examine, first, how these events are structured, the nature of the discourses that accompany them and how they are popularly understood. Second it will examine mediators of the effects of participation upon identification, looking specifically at the role of physical coordination between participants and perceptions of social relations and third, whether these events alter the identities of the participants.</p>\n\n<p>This research will provide a perspective on the various ways in which Irishness is embodied and transformed through participation in collective rituals and on the processes by which people come to an understanding of Irishness.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-1140","grantId":"RES-062-23-1140","fundValue":"160514","fundStart":"2008-12-22","fundEnd":"2011-06-21","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Dominic  Bryan","coPersons":["Stephen  Reicher"],"organisation":"Queen's University of Belfast","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
