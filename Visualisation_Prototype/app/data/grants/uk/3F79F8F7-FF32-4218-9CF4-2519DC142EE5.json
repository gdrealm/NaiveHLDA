For many years the Institute has maintained a strong visitor programme with a healthy reputation and this creates a significant 'mulitplier effect' by which yet more distinguished visitors are attracted to visit on their own funding. The Institute is a key partner in many national and international projects, all of which will both attract active visiting scientists and benefit from the overall visitor programme.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=PP/E001068/1","grantId":"PP/E001068/1","fundValue":"88583","fundStart":"2007-04-01","fundEnd":"2010-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"George  Efstathiou","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
