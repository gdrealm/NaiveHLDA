{"id":"1D749C1B-22D0-4BD2-8AAB-8D001CCA57F4","title":"Tracing the template: Investigating the representation of perceptual relevance","abstractText":"Adaptive perception requires the prioritization of relevant over irrelevant information. When we are looking for a specific book of which we only remember the color of its cover, we can limit our search to mainly that color. The mental representation of what we are looking for is called the attentional template (also target template, search template, attentional set; e.g., Folk et al., 1992). An attentional template is a flexible representation reflecting current selection preferences, as derived from continuously changing task demands and prior selection history. Even though attentional templates are essential for shaping and controlling perception and action in everyday life, surprisingly little is known about their nature. For example, when you look for your car keys, do you look for their shape, their color, or both? In case of the latter, are shape and color integrated in a single representation, or are they independently represented? Can you look for your wallet at the same time, without affecting your &quot;key&quot; template? Furthermore, it is often assumed that visual attention is guided by visual templates, but it is perfectly possible that non-visual types of representation (e.g., semantic codes) are also involved. Finally, the nature of the template may change fundamentally in the course of learning, as a result of selection history. The aim of this collaborative project is to answer some of these fundamental questions.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L016400/1","grantId":"ES/L016400/1","fundValue":"276750","fundStart":"2014-10-01","fundEnd":"2017-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Martin  Eimer","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Birkbeck College","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
