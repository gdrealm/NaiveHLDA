A further purchase has allowed us to install a high temperature stage to look at how materials crystallise and melt at high temperature. However the detector we have whilst high resolution will only collect data very slowly and the physical processes we are interested in may occur quite rapidly. Thus in this proposal we have asked for funding to purchase a new very high speed detector to go with the instrument. Not only will this allow us to investigate phenomena such as melting in glasses, but also more generally, we will be able to run the facility for the UK biomaterials community as data collection times will be extremely short (high quality full pattern data can be collected in a few minutes as opposed to the current setup where we collect data overnight. We do currently run samples for a number of groups in the UK and hope to expand this access.Thus we will be able to investigate interesting phenomena in some novel materials to give a greater understanding of their stability and reactivity but also be able to collect high quality data for users throughout the UK","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E007716/1","grantId":"EP/E007716/1","fundValue":"31278","fundStart":"2006-07-01","fundEnd":"2008-06-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Jonathan Campbell Knowles","coPersons":["Frances Helen Jones"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":" This funding provided and an additional fast detector to expand the capabilities of our diffractometer.
