Briefly, executive functions include our ability to reason, plan ahead, multi-task or switch between tasks, sustain attention, delay gratification, and make complex decisions and change dramatically between childhood and adulthood. Children from Asia are widely reported to outperform children from North America Europe on EF tasks, but this evidence is focused almost entirely on young children and largely ignores the question of whether there are cross-cultural differences in EF for older children and adults.</p>\n\n<p>This project includes two studies that have been carefully designed to establish the validity, magnitude and universality of any East-West contrast in children’s EF performances. Together, these studies have three key goals:</p>\n\n<ol>\n \n\n <li>to improve the measurement of children’s EF by developing psychometrically robust, culturally-fair task batteries that are suitable for use across a broad range of ages</li>\n\n <li>to enhance our understanding of putative cultural contrasts by examining links between within-group variation in EF performance and parenting factors</li>\n\n <li>to explore whether the link between EF and academic achievement show cultural universality and the extent that parental factors influence this link.</li>\n\n</ol>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K010255/1","grantId":"ES/K010255/1","fundValue":"79621","fundStart":"2013-11-12","fundEnd":"2015-05-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  Findings have not yet been disseminated in this way.
