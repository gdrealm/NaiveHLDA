Congestion has a set of well-documented negative\nconsequences, including environmental pollution, poor economic competitiveness, low levels of public satisfaction with\npublic transport, negative impacts on personal health and wellbeing, and a broader reputational impact on urban centres that aspire to be retail and tourist destinations. Moreover, the UK's commitment to reduce carbon emissions necessitates a\nbroader long-term shift away from private motor transport towards low carbon and mass transit modes of transport. In this\nway, tackling the specific issue of urban congestion relates to wider social and economic goals for cities to become better\nplaces to live and easier places to navigate.\nSpecifically, Exeter has some of the worst air pollution and congestion statistics for a city of its size. Yet the city is also\nwitnessing unprecedented expansion of outlying suburbs, creating greater pressure on existing arterial and city centre\nroads. Alongside these background factors, the city aspires to maintain its position as a key retail and tourist centre and\nthere are plans to redevelop several areas of the city centre for retail and leisure facilities in the coming years.\nOne of the ways in which social scientists have attempted to deal with this 'wicked' policy problem is to promote pre-formed\nbehavioural change through the provision of information and exhortations to individual travellers to change their behaviour.\nHowever, decades of social research has illustrated that influencing behaviour is highly complex and requires a significant\ninvestment in research intelligence about what influences travel behaviours. Although recent years have witnessed a\ngrowth in social marketing approaches for influencing change, which adopt the methods of conventional marketing\napproaches, a set of factors that have been largely omitted from such studies and interventions is the role of what can be\ntermed 'real time' factors in travel decision making, which are not pre-formed, but which influence practices in the moment.\nResearch intelligence from traffic management providers suggests that factors such as weather conditions, immediate\nlevels of traffic congestion and perceptions of the effectiveness of public transport are all important to consider when\nunderstanding both decisions to travel and also the resultant behaviour of travellers on their journeys (either as drivers or\npublic transport users). Indeed, crucial to understand are the ways in which these conditions can be communicated to\npromote different practices, either as decisions to travel using different modes or to drive in a different way, and the\npotential for harnessing new technologies for managing travel behaviour through both the utilisation of sophisticated traffic\nmanagement systems.\nThis research therefore aims to understand and promote better 'real time' travel decision making through adopting a\npersonalised and tailored travel behaviour approach. This will be undertaken through a two stage methodology. In stage 1,\na large general survey of Exeter residents and those travelling into Exeter on a daily basis will be undertaken to explore key\ntravel behaviours, attitudes, participants' characteristics. Using an online survey approach, the questionnaire will enable\nresearchers to both identify key segment groups and their travel behaviours and, on the basis of these analyses, to make\nhigh level statistical links between individual behaviours and external factors, including quantitative information from other\ndatasets. In stage 2, a panel of representative participants from the segments identified at stage 1 will be formed to explore\nthe key relationships between behaviours and specific interventions that will be captured through a series of experiments,\nwhich will test interventions and their effectiveness.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/N007328/1","grantId":"NE/N007328/1","fundValue":"292229","fundStart":"2015-11-01","fundEnd":"2017-10-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Stewart  Barr","coPersons":["Daniel  Williamson"],"organisation":"University of Exeter","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
