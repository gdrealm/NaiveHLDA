{"id":"CB57B65E-28BF-4B8E-8E67-F37B915ED5FA","title":"Romanticism, Race and the Colonial Encounter, 1770 - 1840","abstractText":"The project investigates the role played by cultural and scientific assumptions about human variety and difference in the scientific and imaginative literature of writers of the Romantic period, 1770-1840. The development of the 'race idea' in works of Enlightenment science and Romantic literature was discussed and in the context of the ways in which the various and developing theories of human difference are reflected in literary works of the period. The study is particularly distinctive in its stress on the less discussed 'radical types / varieties' of the period, including Polynesian and Melanesian, Han Chinese, Tartar) Mongolian, Manchu), as well as the dominant paradigm of white and black. This study will make a significant impact in an area of literary / historical research that is very current, making strong interdisciplinary links with the history of science, natural history, biology as well as the broader colonial context. It is a major study which has opened up substantial area for further research. My next project will be a larger study of the representation of Far Eastern peoples in historical, travel and imaginative writing of the period.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=111782/1","grantId":"111782/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2006-01-16","fundEnd":"2006-05-15","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter John Kitson","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Dundee","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
