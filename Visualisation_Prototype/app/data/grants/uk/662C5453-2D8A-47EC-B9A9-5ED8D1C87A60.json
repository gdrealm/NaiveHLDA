Although the commonest symptoms of PSS are dry eye, dry mouth, joint pain and profound fatigue, almost any part of the body can be affected. Moreover, PSS is associated with 40 times higher risk of developing lymphoma (a form of cancer). Patients with PSS also have poor quality of life and a significant proportion of PSS patients are unable to work because of their disease. Unfortunately, we know very little about what causes PSS and we have not found any effective treatment. However, several recent developments in PSS research have created a platform for finding new treatment for PSS and improving our understanding of the underlying disease processes of PSS. Firstly, the UK Sjogren?s Interest Group (UKSIG) have developed standardised methods to assess patients with PSS, so that we can test how good a specific treatment is and make comparison with other treatments. Secondly, a number of promising therapies for PSS have been developed in the last few years. Thirdly, emerging new research technologies offer new approaches in PSS research. The aim of this project is to capitalise on these recent developments by creating a database of 500 patients with PSS over a period of 3 years so that new treatments for PSS can be tested more quickly and efficiently and clinical studies can be carried out more effectively. We need so many patients because not all patients are suitable for all studies. We will assess the patients using the standardised methods mentioned earlier and blood samples from these patients will be stored for future research. Patients will be recruited from 24 hospitals across the UK and the assessment will be carried out at the local clinics. This is a UKSIG project, co-ordinated by doctors from Newcastle University, the Freeman Hospital and University Hospital of Birmingham. Many doctors involved in this project have participated in previous multi-centre studies organised by the UKSIG. The proposed database will provide a unique and valuable resource for clinical and academic studies as well as for identifying suitable patients for clinical trials. The database will make it quicker and easier to organise these studies. Furthermore, this project will encourage collaborative research between academia, National Health Service and industry, and will promote the use of standardised assessments in the management of patients with PSS.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0800629","grantId":"G0800629","fundValue":"542469","fundStart":"2008-12-01","fundEnd":"2014-03-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Wan-Fai  Ng","coPersons":["Simon  Bowman","Bridget  Griffiths","Ian  Griffiths"],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
