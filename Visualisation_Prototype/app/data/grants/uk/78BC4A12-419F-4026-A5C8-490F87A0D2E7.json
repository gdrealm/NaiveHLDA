The study focuses especially on antisocial behaviour, depression, and psychosis. We have studied 2200 twins and their parents at the twins birth, age 5 and age 7, and we will follow up these families when the twins are ages 10 and 12 years. Our aim is to uncover gene-environment interactions affecting the mental health of children. A gene-environment interaction occurs when the effect on a person of exposure to environmental risk depends upon their genotype (or conversely, when environmental experience controls the action of genes). We have discovered two such interactions already, and if more are found to influence behaviour disorders, this will improve basic-science methodology in psychiatric genetics. Moreover, specific environmental effects revealed to be stronger in the presence of genetic risk would encourage more environmental prevention programmes, and would help to identify who needs prevention most. Specific genes revealed to be stronger in the presence of environmental risk would guide strategic research and development, possibly leading to genetic diagnostics and pharmacological interventions.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G9806489","grantId":"G9806489","fundValue":"5386640","fundStart":"1998-09-21","fundEnd":"2009-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Terrie  Moffitt","coPersons":["Louise  Arseneault","Jonathan  Mill","Avshalom  Caspi"],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
