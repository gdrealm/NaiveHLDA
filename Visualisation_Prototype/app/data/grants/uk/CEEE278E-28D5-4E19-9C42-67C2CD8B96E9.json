Electronic signals are manipulated at GHz frequencies with semiconductor devices and signals are transmitted over large distances via optical fibres using semiconductor lasers and detectors. However, new approaches to process and transmit information are required to keep pace with the daunting increase in the volume of information and the continued miniaturization of devices. To address this, radical ideas which exploit coherent quantum states are being developed for a diverse range of applications including communication, information processing, and metrology. As with the existing digital economy, semiconductor heterostructures will be central to future commercialization of quantum technologies. The most feasible approach to implement quantum technologies is to interface flying bits of quantum information, photons, with the semiconductor quantum states. Hence, quantum photonic devices with extremely efficient light-matter interaction (at the single photon level) are paramount for the future digital economy. This Challenging Engineering programme aims to engineer ideal quantum photonic devices and exploit them for an array of quantum technologies. Success will be a major boost to UK competitiveness in a key frontier research area and strategies are in place to impact multiple academic disciplines, UK industry, and multiple segments of the general public.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I023186/1","grantId":"EP/I023186/1","fundValue":"1057010","fundStart":"2011-05-01","fundEnd":"2016-04-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Brian D Gerardot","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Heriot-Watt University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
