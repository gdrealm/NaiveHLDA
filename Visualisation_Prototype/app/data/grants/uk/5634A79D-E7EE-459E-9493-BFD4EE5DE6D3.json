It has been shown that stochastic effects in molecular interactions cannot be ignored in many cases, since they have major impacts on the dynamics of the networks. On the other hand, the modelling and analysis of whole biological systems will usually result in extremely large size problems. Hence, as the requirement for the mathematical modelling of biological systems becomes more realistic, we have to deal with large-scale stochastic systems, and the corresponding robustness analysis problem is more complicated and difficult. In this research, we aim to extend current robustness analysis methodologies using a novel geometrical interpretation of robustness analysis combined with a probabilistic framework so that it can be applicable for large-scale stochastic systems. While robustness analysis problems have usually been formulated using linear algebra approaches, we suggest a geometrical approach, such that the robustness analysis problem can be posed as two manifold intersections. With this geometrical condition, the robustness analysis can be performed for the cases including stochastic noises and it can be applicable for large-scale systems because the algorithm could be parallelised so that the calculations are performed on a distributed computing system. This research will facilitate our understanding of the fundamental structures and sources of robustness of biological systems, which is a key factor in improving drug development for various diseases, since it will allow us to find the weakest (fragile) structure of the system and hence to develop efficient medical therapies.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G036195/1","grantId":"EP/G036195/1","fundValue":"326499","fundStart":"2009-08-01","fundEnd":"2012-07-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The algorithm developed for robustness analysis of complex systems has been used for fine tuning design of a control algorithm in UKube-1, which was lunched in the summer 2014.

Understanding how these components interact each other and unravelling important underlying mechanisms are the cornerstone towards full comprehension of life. One of the profound characteristics of life is robustness, which is observed even in very primitive cellular life. Resistant to environmental changes and sustaining functionality to noisy interactions among the components are inherent characteristics of all life. Systems Biology interprets life as an organised system of many components. The ultimate questions that we have pursued are how the robustness of life is emerged from many components and how to quantify the robustness.\n\nTowards the answers to the ultimate questions, efficient algorithms for robustness analysis of life in different mathematical descriptions are developed as follows:\n\nFirstly, we developed an efficient method to simulate noisy molecular interactions, which combines an approximate method with an error correction method. The approximation error is increased as the simulation time increases. The error is estimated by a few exact noise simulations and reduced by updating the simulation. The efficiency was demonstrated by the oscillation network of molecular concentration in amoebae. In addition, a systematic way of quantifying the noise effect with uncertain parameters are developed.\n\nSecondly, biological systems have finite life-span and it is not necessary that they are robust longer than the restricted time length. Mathematically, this is challenging as finite time characteristics cannot be easily checked through existing mathematical terms. Although some may unstable, they may perfectly acceptable for a shorter period of time if the states only diverge slowly. We developed an efficient finite-time system quantification method, which estimates the bounds of the states. The algorithm is applied to estimate the finite time behaviour of ErbB network, which is the biological network related to human breast cancer.\n\nThirdly, in order to study much large-scale systems, we need to use some different mathematical descriptions. Boolean network is a promising approach for modelling large-scale systems, where the states are binary, on or off, which resembles to activation or inactivation of some genes. As the Boolean has only two states, the properties whether multiple Boolean states are converge to some states or show any periodical behaviour are the main interest in analysing the Boolean system. Existing algorithms to reveal these can deal with only small size systems. We develop an algorithm that reduces this limitation significantly by separating original networks into smaller subnetworks and combining each subnetwork analysis. This algorithm only takes a few seconds to reveal all stationary and periodic solutions of T-cell receptor kinetics. \n\nFinally, static network analysis provides different levels of robustness of biological systems. Static network is composed of nodes and edges. Nodes represent various molecular species and edges represent direct interaction between two nodes connected. Among many properties in the network, especially, modular or community structure are believed to be the origin of robustness. We studied brain network modular structure to find any differences between socio-economical performance among people. In addition, robustness of modular structure of large-scale networks shows correlation between critical perturbations and drug targets in human protein-protein interactions.\n\nThe algorithms developed will be further used to expand for our understanding about essential properties of life in future. Robustness is a fundamental property of nature and human-made systems. Systems that we are interested in most have become large and the large-scale systems are hard to design and analyse. We developed computational methods to efficiently perform these tasks. The results would be the stepping stone towards full understanding of complex large-scale systems.
