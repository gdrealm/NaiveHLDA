{"id":"EBC6B018-2D7B-4189-9842-AA46D6A0B57F","title":"The Electronic Music of Roberto Gerhard","abstractText":"The electronic music of Roberto Gerhard is an unexplored resource that has the potential to change not only our evaluation of this composer's work but also the development of electronic music in the UK from the 1950s onwards. Gerhard's work has as yet, not been documented due to his lack of institutional support, the difficulty in accessing his archive and the fact that this archive is not catalogued. In the archive at the Cambridge University Library are a large number of unpublished electronic works, electronic incidental music and sketches and rehearsal tapes for the Symphony no. 3 (Collages), one of the first major works following Varese's Desert to integrate orchestra and electronics. Now the University of Huddersfield has agreed a contract with the CUL to digitize and research the electronic music of Gerhard, this research project seeks to address a number of issues: what is the significance of Gerhard's electronic music on his own later instrumental music? what is Gerhard's influence on electronic music in the UK; how did Gerhard generate and structure his material? The research results will form the final three chapters of a book edited by the PI and Prof. Michael Russ. The remaining chapters are expanded versions of papers given at the 1st International Roberto Gerhard Conference which took place at the University of Huddersfield in May 2010. The PI and two RAs will also edit all of the electronic music for publication on CD by sub rosa.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/I025395/1","grantId":"AH/I025395/1","fundValue":"146202","fundStart":"2012-01-01","fundEnd":"2012-12-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  Our findings have been published in the book 'The Roberto Gerhard Companion' by Ashgate; released on CD by sub rosa (one of the most reputed labels for releasing historic electronic work); formed the basis for two extended radio documentaries in Spain. We imagine that the CD recording of works will have the most impact. However, this was only released in early October 2014 so its full impact has yet to be felt. Following reviews in the international press we anticipate that Gerhard's work and our research will gain even wider public exposure.

Our work clearly demonstrates that Gerhard's engagement with electronic music was far more substantial. In his tape archive the research team found a number of hitherto unheard works. These have been digitised and released commercially on CD. We have also documented our findings in the Roberto Gerhard Companion - a volume of essays published by Ashgate. Prof. Adkins co-edited the book with Prof. Michael Russ (University of Huddersfield). Three of the chapters were specifically about the electronic music and its influence on Gerhard's late instrumental style. http://www.ashgate.com/isbn/9781409445159 (book) http://www.subrosa.net/en/catalogue/early-electronic-music/roberto-gerhard.html (CD) There are a number of opportunities arising. Robert Worby (BBC Radio 3) is keen to take this research further and present a radio programme about Gerhard's work and his position in the BBC Radiophonic Workshop. The original research team are continuing to research the archive with a view to making available performing versions of Gerhard's radio and theatre music with electronics. The release of the CD is important as it fills in another missing link in the early days of the history of British Electronic Music. This will be of importance to scholars, students and enthusiasts of electronic music. Creative Economy","dataset":"gtr"}
