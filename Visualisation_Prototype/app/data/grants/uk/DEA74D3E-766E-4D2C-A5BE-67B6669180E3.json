{"id":"DEA74D3E-766E-4D2C-A5BE-67B6669180E3","title":"ExoMars Magnetometry Support for PDR Phase","abstractText":"The European Space Agency's ExoMars mission will land on the surface of Mars. In addition to various instruments and a rover vehicle targeting the possibility of life and the surface geology, a suite of instruments located on the lander will conduct investigations into the physics of the environment, including both atmospheric and sub-surface measurements. Included in this package is the first ever magnetic field experiment to be placed on the surface in order to investigate the interaction of the Sun's supersonic wind with the planetary atmosphere, and to utilise magnetic sounding techniques to investigate the sub-surface layers including any permafrost. Imperial College will calibrate this magnetometer in its state-of-the-art SRIF-funded calibration facility, play a leading role in the onboard software for the magnetometer, and play an active role in the preparation for and exploitation of the data. The UK team includes members from Leicester University and from the GEOSPACE consortium of institutions (University of Edinburgh, lead, together with the British Geological Survey, Leeds Univeristy, Liverpool University) in support of the magnetometer to be constructed by the Danish National Space Center in Copenhagen.The present proposal will support the instrument team's preparation for the Preliminary Design Review to be conducted toward the end of 2008 through provision of a Software Requirements Document, verification of the procedures and capability of the calibration facility to handle the magnetometer consistent with Planetary Protection requirements. Additionally, a small amount of support is required to prepare the UK team for the next phases of the mission.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/G003122/1","grantId":"ST/G003122/1","fundValue":"28933","fundStart":"2008-08-01","fundEnd":"2010-06-30","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Steven J Schwartz","coPersons":["Michele K Dougherty"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
