{"id":"7AD336D8-AB7E-45DA-8145-4936D27A7B89","title":"Forebrain development: From neural plate to cortical specification","abstractText":"The most complicated part of our brain is called the forebrain and forms the cerebral hemispheres. It develops from a very simple group of cells in the embryo and the events that transform the simple structure into the complex human cerebral hemispheres are not well understood. However, when one or many of these events are not taking place, it leads to mild or severe mental retardations. Understanding what these events are and how they shape our brain is therefore very important. This programme of research aims to identify the key events that lead to forebrain formation in vertebrates. It also seeks to discover the particular steps that create the complexity inherent to our mammalian brain. Understanding these steps will show new ways to approach mental retardation and give new tools for stem cell regenerative therapies.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0901525","grantId":"G0901525","fundValue":"1365140","fundStart":"2010-10-01","fundEnd":"2016-04-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Corinne  Houart","coPersons":[],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
