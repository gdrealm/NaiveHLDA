Among the most prominent infectious diseases is malaria, which is transmitted exclusively by mosquitoes of the Anopheles genus. Current strategies aimed at tackling this disease rely extensively on the control of vector populations in the field, mainly through the use of insecticide indoor residual sprays and insecticide-impregnated bednets. However, insurgence of resistance in mosquitoes and the lack of novel insecticidal compounds are major hurdles in the fight against malaria, and novel ideas and tools are urgently needed. This proposal focuses on the reproductive biology of the species of mosquito primarily responsible for the transmission of malaria in Africa, known as Anopheles gambiae. An. gambiae mosquitoes mate only once in their lifetime, which means that disrupting the reproductive process offers a good way of dramatically reducing natural populations in Africa. When they mate, the male mosquito transfers sperm to the female and then afterwards transfers a coagulated mass of proteins and seminal fluids known as a mating plug, which is formed in the male accessory glands (MAGs), the mosquito equivalent of the human prostate. The MAGs have been shown by a number of studies to play a very important role in An. gambiae fertility. Transfer of MAG secretions (mainly proteins and lipids) to female mosquitoes has been shown to reduce the female willingness to mate again. Furthermore, our previous studies have shown that transfer of the mating plug is essential for the correct storage of sperm in the female, and hence for female fertility. A deeper knowledge of factors and mechanisms shaping the function of the MAGs would undoubtedly provide novel tools and ideas for the control of mosquito populations in the field through the manipulation of their fertility. As an example, if molecular mechanisms ensuring male fertility were identified, then we could design chemicals to inhibit such mechanisms that could be delivered to field mosquitoes in order to limit their reproductive output. In this project we will perform a detailed analysis of the MAGs, unravelling their functions in regulating mosquito reproductive success. In particular, we will assess whether the MAGs are regulating male behaviour, and we will analyse the roles in fertility of small peptide hormones produced in these reproductive organs. The results obtained here will remarkably improve our knowledge of the reproductive processes occurring in Anopheles mosquitoes, and will provide us with tremendous opportunities to translate this knowledge into practical tools for vector control. To achieve our goals, we will validate the results obtained in the laboratory in field mosquitoes, in collaboration with Professor Dan Masiga, from the International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology (ICIPE), Kenya. Strong collaborative links are already established between our groups within the framework of EU projects and in the form of a joint PhD studentship. Our study will focus on An. gambiae mosquitoes, however it could subsequently be extended to other insect pests of medical and agricultural importance. We anticipate that this project will have a profound impact on malaria research, and will contribute to the training and scientific excellence of the next generation of scientists.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I002898/1","grantId":"BB/I002898/1","fundValue":"382592","fundStart":"2011-05-09","fundEnd":"2014-05-08","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Flaminia  CatterucciaGeorge  Christophides","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":" Objective 1. Assessing the role of the MAGs in Anopheles reproduction\n\nThe first objective of this project is to unravel the role of the male accessory glands (MAGs) in ensuring reproductive success of Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes. With the view to identify genes important for reproduction, we have performed microarray analysis of the MAGs at three time points (3 hours, 12 hours and 24 hours) after mating. Mated tissues were compared to those from age-matched virgin males in four biological replicates using single channel Agilent 4x44K microarrays. This analysis has identified a large number of genes that are regulated by mating in the male mosquito. Surprisingly, a total of 4,319 genes were found to be differentially expressed after mating (P&amp;lt;0.05 FDR corrected), of which 2,296 were up-regulated and 2,023 were down-regulated. Maximum differential expression was observed at 12 (1,658 genes) and at 24 hours post mating (1,487 genes). In particular, genes that are important for the synthesis of steroid hormones were upregulated after mating, suggesting that males need steroid hormones for mating-related behaviours. While the microarray analysis is completed now, functional analyses of the hormonal pathway are underway (see aim 2) and will be incorporated into a manuscript describing both microarray data and follow up functional studies. \n\n\n\nWe have also studied the function of the Paired transcription factor in MAG development and gene expression. Paired was silenced by RNA interference (RNAi) injections in larvae: the initial hypothesis was that Paired silencing during larval development would generate adult males with no MAGs, as shown in Drosophila melanogaster. MAG-less males would then be used in mating experiments to assess the role of MAG secretions in modulating the post-mating physiology of females. Our results show that gene expression is reduced in Paired-silenced MAGs. However no obvious phenotype in terms of female post-mating behaviour was detected in matings between silenced males and virgin females: females were still capable of laying eggs and were normally refractory to further copulation. In order to determine the function of seminal secretions in triggering these post-mating responses, an in vivo system to identify matings defective in the transfer of MAG secretions was therefore developed. This system is based on previous work from the laboratory showing that coagulation of secretions into forming a mating plug can be prevented by silencing a MAG-specific transglutaminase enzyme. Further work has allowed us to use this system to selectively identify females that receive no mating plug during mating without the need to dissect them. Our work is demonstrating that transfer of coagulated secretions is necessary to trigger oviposition and refractoriness to further copulation, allowing us to circumvent the problems associated with developing MAG-less males. These experiments are being finalised at present and it is anticipated that a manuscript will be submitted before summer 2013.\n\n\n\nObjective 2. Analysis of the role of small MAG-derived peptide hormones in fertility and female behaviour. \n\nIn this objective we proposed to identify small peptide hormones produced by the MAGs and assess their function. To this aim, we have targeted by dsRNA injections the male genes (glutaminyl peptide cyclotransferase, PHM and PAM) putatively involved in the formation of peptide hormones. We have generated antibodies against the three genes and determined their profile of expression. We have also assessed that RNAi injections are effective at silencing these genes by qRT-PCR and by immunoblotting. Phenotypic assay will be used to understand the role of these peptide hormones in male and female reproductive biology. Assays will include the analysis of sperm movement, mating receptivity, egg laying, fecundity and fertility of the mated females. At the same time, a pathway important for the synthesis of steroid hormone has been identified following the microarray analysis in Objective 1. Functional analyses are underway to determine whether these hormones affect female post-mating physiology. A manuscript containing these study and the microarray data will be submitted before the end of 2013.\n\n\n\nObjective 3. Validation of candidates in field mosquitoes.\n\n\n\nWe have laid the ground for performing functional assays in semi-field conditions. To this end, we have established and validated mating protocols in semi-field cages (malariasphere, large outdoor cages exposed to environmental conditions and containing resting, breeding and swarming sites) at the Mbita Point field station of ICIPE, Kenya. We have observed occurrence of swarming and mating the first day following a release of males and female mosquitoes from laboratory cages into the semi-field facility. We have captured mating couples and assessed occurrence of insemination. The results obtained indicate that only 50% of the captured matings produced insemination. Our explanation for this observation is that different energy requirements imposed by flying in large containers relative to small laboratory cages prevent males from transferring a full complement of seminal fluid. Experiments are underway to determine whether improvements in the male diet can induce an increase in insemination rate. These results will be ready for publication in the next 6 months, These results have the potential to be translated into tools for the control of mosquito populations transmitting malaria in Africa.
