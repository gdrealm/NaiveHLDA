However, so far little theoretical research has been conducted on the private provision of security. What does the marketisation and commodification mean for the concept of security? How does it affect how security and threats are defined? How does it change how we address these threats? This project seeks to address these leading questions by investigating four interconnected developments and their policy implications. The first is the progressive deterritorialisation of security as both threats and the provision of security are no longer associated with states, but with&nbsp;groups and individuals. The second is the emergence of risk management - the shift from addressing existing security threats to managing perceived and unknown future risks. The third is the individualisation of security as the requirements of a private market turn security from a collective good into a divisible and exclusionary property. And the fourth is the depoliticisation of security policy making as states share or pass on responsibility for the provision of security to the market.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-1516","grantId":"RES-000-22-1516","fundValue":"35502","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2008-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Elke  Krahmann","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
