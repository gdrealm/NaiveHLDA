The first immediate impact has been to raise public awareness of this problem and the dissemination of the project findings through the national press and broadcast media, as well as other forums like public lectures, has helped serve this purpose. \n\nMore direct impact has been made through discussions with industry participants. Here the challenge is finding win-win solutions that benefit the public as well as the industry participants. As an illustration, Tesco, as the UK's leading supermarket retailer, has made a move towards adapting the use of multi-buy special offers on highly perishable fresh salad products in a way that is less likely to result in food waste of such products, such as using offers like &quot;buy one get one later&quot;, where a voucher is provided to the customer so that they do not need to take the addition &quot;free&quot; product at the time of purchase but can pick it up on another date - which benefits the shopper in reducing waste but also the retailer by encouraging the shopper to come back to the store. This research project and the discussions with managers at Tesco PLC provides support and encouragement for the use of such innovative pricing practices which can deliver win-win solutions but just as importantly makes them aware that the disclosure of our findings in raising public awareness will impact on consumer behaviour and result in negative sentiment unless actions are taken to alleviate the problem of pricing in a way that steers consumers to excessive and wasteful food purchasing.

The research has produced policy proposals and advice for consumers and businesses to help alleviate the economic and social costs for the public benefit. The research findings have attracted considerable press and broadcast media attention to help make the public more aware of the health and environmental dangers resulting from excessive food purchasing exacerbating obesity problems and increasing household food waste. Discussions with Tesco PLC highlight their concerns as the UK's leading retailer of the need to ensure that food pricing does not distort consumer purchasing behaviour and is seen as fair and appropriate.
