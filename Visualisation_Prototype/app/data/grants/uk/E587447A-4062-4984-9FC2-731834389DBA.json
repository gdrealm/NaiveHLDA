{"id":"E587447A-4062-4984-9FC2-731834389DBA","title":"Raman spectroscopy as a novel analytical bioprocessing tool for PAT","abstractText":"Protein-based biopharmaceuticals are becoming increasingly widely used as therapeutic agents and biotherapeutics; for example antibody therapy is become very popular and is used for explicit diseases and helps the immune system. These proteins are manufactured within cells and in order for them to be active they need to be produced and purified in the correct way. Whilst some methods do exist they are laborious and destroy the sample. By contrast we will develop a method based on the interaction of light with matter that will enable a very powerful and non-invasive analysis. One process that happens when light is shone at a substance is that it is scattered and sometimes this light is scatter at a different wavelength; an effect named Raman scattering. We will therefore develop Raman spectroscopy as a novel method for the direct in situ analysis of the production process, thereby allowing more rigorous assessment of these protein-based biopharmaceuticals.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/G010250/1","grantId":"BB/G010250/1","fundValue":"401725","fundStart":"2009-07-01","fundEnd":"2012-12-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Royston  Goodacre","coPersons":["Alan  Dickson","Gillian  Stephens"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
