One such problem is the selection of materials able to withstand the intense flux of energy and neutrons from the fusion reaction. The plasma-facing materials are subjected extremely high energy fluxes, therefore it is essential that heat is rapidly transported away from the surface material to prevent surface temperature rising above the melting temperature. Heat energy is transported in solids by lattice vibrations and the movement of electrons. In metals, under normal conditions, most of the heat is transported by the electrons as they can move easily through the lattice. However only part of the energy deposited in the first wall of fusion power plants goes to the electrons, the rest is deposited in the lattice. The system is a long way from equilibrium, with the lattice having a different temperature from the electrons and the energy is transported both by electrons and by lattice vibrations. Interactions between the atoms and the electrons gradually drive the system to equilibrium, with the electrons and the lattice having the same temperature.We propose to investigate energy transport under such highly non-equilibrium conditions, such as those found at the first walls of fusion power-plants, using simulation techniques. The common technique of Molecular Dynamics will be extended to include the effects of energy transport by the excited electrons and the coupling between the lattice and the electrons. This will help us to estimate the conditions under which we can expect surface melting at the first walls of fusion power plants and to suggest methods that will prevent surface melting occurring.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D079578/1","grantId":"EP/D079578/1","fundValue":"189647","fundStart":"2007-02-01","fundEnd":"2009-01-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The findings about the effects of excited electrons on interatomic interactions have had an impact on radiation damage simulations.

Tungsten is the preferred choice for the divertor region of fusion power plants, due to its very high melting temperature. The divertor experiences extremely high heat and particle fluxes and designing a material that will survive such conditions is a long standing challenge in the fusion community.\n\nIn this project we extended a method we developed for including the electronic effects in models of ion irradiation to models of sputtering, where the atoms knocked out of the surface, by atoms escaping the plasma, are modelled. We also published a procedure for including the effects of modified interactions, due to the excited electrons, in the simulations. The effects of excited electrons on the interactions between the atoms in a metal is an important field of research. It is necessary to be able to calculate such effects and to include them in atomistic simulations in order improve the accuracy of radiation damage simulations. We are currently improving our original method and will soon be publishing it and making it available for others in the field. Energy","dataset":"gtr"}
