Working with our partners who deliver services and policies for the children and families sector we developed and piloted a model for delivering evidence to practitioners and policy makers. A range of issues were considered including: whether the evidence met the needs of the requester; value for money and affordability; desirable features and products; tools and processes; timescales and ERB capacity regarding supply/demand. The four partner organisations are all continuing to use the evidence delivered under this project. West Lothian Council and The Scottish Government are using the review on transitions between nursery and primary school to inform their work with the Early Years Collaborative. Parenting Across Scotland are using the demographic report on families to develop services. Children in Scotland are using both reports to develop and deliver their training programme.
