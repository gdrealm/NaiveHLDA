{"id":"02C6665E-96CE-4FE1-B1A2-566AE2FF473F","title":"TOPCAT - the leading astronomical catalogue software","abstractText":"TOPCAT, with its associated libraries, is the leading astronomical catalogue software, and has been adopted by many large-scale projects. Its development to this stage of national and international acceptance, by Dr. Mark Taylor, was funded until recently by the AstroGrid grant. Now that this grant has been terminated, this exceptionally useful software will lose functionality and handicap existing projects unless it continues to adapt to cope with the changing standards of the Virtual Observatory and the changing requirements of its chief users. This proposal requests funding for 24 months to provide the improvements to TOPCAT most requested by its current users and to keep it fully compliant with the developing Virtual Observatory protocols. The funding will also support work on the Simple Astronomical Messaging Protocol, SAMP, which covers data exchange between different tools running on a user's computer, so that TOPCAT can work with many other tools, including the Microsoft World-Wide Telescope and the Herschel Interactive Processing Environment. SAMP was defined by Taylor et al. (2009), and Mark Taylor's implementations of the protocol are now embedded in TOPCAT and other standard astronomical tools.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/H008470/1","grantId":"ST/H008470/1","fundValue":"76569","fundStart":"2009-12-01","fundEnd":"2010-10-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"  This short grant picked up support of the TOPCAT and SAMP software development after the end of the AstroGrid consortium's funding, and improved TOPCAT's ability to work with Virtual Observatory protocols, and to interoperate with other desktop utilities (such as Aladin, ds9, and gaia) via SAMP. The software releases made during the grant added to the functionality available to users, and increased the uptake of the software in the community. Considerable work on Virtual Observatory protocols was also needed over this period, and the grant supported a major role in developing those protocols and maintaining a strong UK presence in the way that the VO developed.

They have become an essential part of the research toolbox used by astronomers world-wide, and have been integrated into the data-analysis paths of many projects, from ground-based surveys to space-based operations. During the period of this grant explorations of the usefulness of TOPCAT for interaction with the dataset from the Gaia satellite were performed - these later led to a share of an EU grant to prepare the interactive part of the Gaia data system. The data-handling and data-plotting aspects of the software are widely applicable to catalogue data, and with a few FTE years could be useful in multiple fields. The software has already been used on an experimental basis outside astrophysics.
