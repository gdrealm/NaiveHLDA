The research will address one of the most controversial debates in cognitive science: the extent to which productive language use is rule-dependent or an emergent property of analogies made over stored items. Finnish provides a particularly important linguistic context within which to test the competing predictions of these different approaches to language because it is a highly inflected language. Therefore, in contrast to English, which has an impoverished inflectional system, Finnish will allow us to observe the contribution of the different memory systems across a range of morphemes that vary in their productivity and frequency in the ambient language. One hundred and fifty 4 â€“ 6-year-old native Finnish-speaking children will complete a battery of tests measuring their morphological knowledge, vocabulary knowledge, declarative and procedural memory, and non-verbal intelligence. It is expected that the results will provide a unique insight into the acquisition of morphology, since the rich morphology system of the language will enable strong tests of different models of acquisition.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F031866/1","grantId":"ES/F031866/1","fundValue":"73353","fundStart":"2007-11-19","fundEnd":"2009-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Evan  Kidd","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
