Why did the Christian religion and the talking cure, 'the church and the couch', find common ground in a post-war era of secularisation? The answer will contribute to scholarly debates in theology, religious studies, and the history and theory of psychotherapy. The project's results will also inform a professional audience of psychotherapists, counsellors, clergy, and pastoral workers. Furthermore, by engaging in a dialogue with this audience, the project's results will have an additional wider relevance to policy. Psychotherapy is facing a contested process of state regulation in which a medical model of therapy has so far been central. By recovering other ways of understanding psychotherapy - such as the interpersonal pastoral relation - the project will inform this ongoing debate.\\nThe project asks three questions. First, how did psychotherapy in post-war Scotland borrow and adapt Christian ideas and practices? A number of figures and organisations will be investigated: the radical psychiatrist R.D. Laing's involvement with the Iona community; the network of psychotherapists associated with the philosopher John Macmurray in Edinburgh; and the activities of the psychoanalysts W.R.D. Fairbairn and John D. Sutherland. This is followed by a second complementary question: how did Christianity in post-war Scotland adopt and translate psychotherapeutic ideas and practices? As well as investigating the ideas of theologians such as Ronald Gregor Smith, this part of the project will examine the ways in which the Scottish churches promoted counselling and pastoral care through organisations such as the Scottish Pastoral Association. The project then proceeds to a third, limited and exploratory question: how was this Scottish fusion of Christianity and psychotherapy exported to England? This will focus on the psychotherapist Harry Guntrip, the 'clinical theologian' Brian Lake, and the Clinical Theology Association (the organisation which Lake founded).\\n Two main sources of evidence are investigated: documents and oral-history testimony. The documentary analysis will examine published and unpublished material, including discursive works, personal documents, and institutional records. It will be guided by the interpretive position that even our recent culture is in need of careful expert reconstruction and will explore the underlying rhetoric and metaphors that quietly moulded ideas about religion and psychotherapy. The oral-history testimony will be collected from around fifteen figures who have been selected because of their expertise, commitment and leading institutional roles during this time. Their testimony will be used primarily to understand the personal networks of the time, how the ideas of this period were lived and experienced, and how these led to a certain understanding of the value of the 'examined life'.\\n The project will produce several academic articles, as well as presentations at scholarly conferences, while pursuing other strategies in order to disseminate results more widely. A professional audience of psychotherapists, counsellors, clergy and pastoral workers will be addressed through two conferences hosted at the University of Edinburgh. The project team will also reach their professional audience through events organised with bodies such as The Sutherland Trust, COSCA (Counselling and Psychotherapy in Scotland), the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy, and Scottish Churches House, as well as through training of ordinands, a web-site, a project summary, a plain-language report, and articles in practitioner newsletters or journals. Wider impact will be attempted through the website, popular articles and production of a radio programme.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/H016589/1","grantId":"AH/H016589/1","fundValue":"251216","fundStart":"2010-01-01","fundEnd":"2012-05-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"David  Fergusson","coPersons":["Liz  Bondi","Steven  Sutcliffe"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
