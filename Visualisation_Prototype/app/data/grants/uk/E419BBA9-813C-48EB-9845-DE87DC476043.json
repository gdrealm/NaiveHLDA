{"id":"E419BBA9-813C-48EB-9845-DE87DC476043","title":"SNP based sib-pair linkage study to identify loci contributing to Vesicoureteric Reflux and its associated nephropathy","abstractText":"Vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) is the term used for the abnormal passage of urine back up the ureters towards the kidneys. Urine is made by the kidneys and passes from each kidney down a tube called the ureter to the bladder. When someone goes to the toilet, urine leaves the bladder via the urethra and should not re-enter the ureters. Kidney damage associated with VUR accounts for end stage kidney failure (i.e. needing dialysis or transplant) in 3,000 people in the UK. VUR is found in 20-50% of brothers and sisters of affected individuals indicating that there are genetic factors contributing to this abnormality. We have collected blood samples from a large number of brothers and sisters with VUR and their parents and extracted DNA from these samples. We are using normal genetic variation to find DNA variants associated with the condition. This is the first step towards identifying the genetic causes of VUR. We hope that identifying the causes of VUR will lead to better screening tests so that people with VUR can be identified and treated before their kidneys are damaged. We also hope that a better understanding of the causes will lead to new treatment strategies.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0600040","grantId":"G0600040","fundValue":"547276","fundStart":"2007-01-01","fundEnd":"2009-06-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Judith Anne Goodship","coPersons":["Adrian  Woolf","Heather  Cordell","Rajko  Kenda","Sally  Feather","Tim  Goodship"],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
