Aquatic animals need to orient efficiently through their volumetric habitats to exploit resources and avoid adverse conditions or predators. Indeed, being able to learn, remember and re-use information about local environments is key to their success. Despite this, we do not know how aquatic animals such as fish, or in fact how any animal learns and remembers information about volumetric environments. In comparison to a surface, the amount of information contained in a volume is massively increased. Artificial intelligence systems and humans find orienting through volumes extremely difficult, how then do animals such as fish cope? In relation to terrestrial habitats, aquatic environments have an extra available cue that could aid three-dimensional orientation - hydrostatic pressure. This cue could provide information about the vertical axis of space, either by allowing a fish to work out exactly where it is in the water column, or by giving compass-like information - telling a fish which way is up and down. We aim to discover whether fish can use hydrostatic pressure to orient, and what type of information it gives. Fish are known to be able to perceive small incremental changes in hydrostatic pressure, and a number of potential receptive mechanisms have been found. It therefore seems highly likely that fish have adapted to use this cue that is unique to aquatic systems as a way of coping with the unique problems associated with finding their way around a volumetric environment. In this project, we aim to find out whether fish use hydrostatic pressure to orient vertically, and if so how this cue is used. We will test whether fish use other potential vertical cues such as light, and distance to the surface, to determine whether one cue type is preferred (maybe pressure, as it is ever-present and usable at night or in conditions where visibility is poor), and whether there is redundancy in the cue-use system. We will build on this to consider orientation through three-dimensions, and whether fish orient using different mechanisms when in landmark-rich versus landmark-poor environments. Is pressure always the preferred cue as it is always available, or can the use of landmarks improve precision in orientation? Finally, we will consider orientation through a full volume, and whether fish can encode distance and direction within such a complex 3D space, or whether errors occur in either the horizontal or vertical dimensions. In other words, we aim to work out how fish learn and remember the features and cues of their volumetric habitat, so as to make the correct directional choices when they have to get somewhere in a hurry.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/H01103X/1","grantId":"BB/H01103X/1","fundValue":"425676","fundStart":"2010-10-01","fundEnd":"2013-09-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The research that this grant supported is concerned with unraveling the behavioural mechanisms that underpin spatial cognition, those fundamental processes that allow animals to navigate effectively through their local environment. Our main animal models are fish, which have to deal with the complexity of intrinsically 3D environments. We used theoretical and empirical approaches to answer questions that range from studying the senses that are used to obtain information on the local surroundings, through to exploring how this information is learned, remembered and recalled to enable efficient navigation. Exploiting the potential of biological principles, particularly in animal navigation, could be an important step for the engineering design of autonomous systems. I have had meetings with representatives from the Office of Naval Research with a view to exploring this further.

Artificial intelligence systems and humans find orienting through volumes extremely difficult, how then do animals such as fish cope? \n\nIn relation to terrestrial habitats, aquatic environments have an extra available cue that could aid three-dimensional orientation - hydrostatic pressure. This cue could provide information about the vertical axis of space, either by allowing a fish to work out exactly where it is in the water column, or by giving compass-like information - telling a fish which way is up and down. In a theoretical paper we overturned the received wisdom of more than 100 years to show that, in principle, fish can estimate their depth using hydrostatic pressure. Our model shows they could do this if they combine a measurement of their vertical speed with a measurement of the fractional change of their swim-bladder volume. Data collected (and currently being written for publication) give empirical support to this theoretical study. In short, we have shown compellingly, that fish can use hydrostatic pressure to ascertain their depth. Fish have adapted to use this pressure cue that is unique to aquatic systems as a way of coping with the unique problems associated with finding their way around a volumetric environment. These results have clear implications for the design of underwater submersibles. \n\nBuilding from this finding, we then considered the problems of orientation through full three-dimensional space. We found that the vertical axis (and presumably therefore pressure cues) are always extremely important to fish, even overriding other cues, such as visual landmarks. Surprisingly, this is the case for fish that feeling swim through the water column (pelagic) and for those that tend to remain on the substrate (benthic). In a final set of experiments, we developed new high resolution 3D tracking systems that allowed us to track fish that had been trained to swim through a 3D maze. By interrogating these tracks in detail we found that fish can encode distance and direction within a complex 3D space, and that the surprising very small errors accrued in the horizontal or vertical dimensions are equal. In other words, we have worked out how fish learn and remember the features and cues of their volumetric habitat, so as to make the correct directional choices when they have to get somewhere in a hurry. The main aims of the grant were to test: 1. Which cues are used to orient in the vertical axis of space, and how they interact. 2. The nature of the hydrostatic cue and whether it can be used to determine absolute location in the vertical column, or whether it gives directional compass-like information. 3. The effect of the presence of landmarks on the relative weighting given to the vertical and horizontal components of space in fishes' internal representation of space. 4. Whether fish can encode distance and direction in a volume. We not only fulfilled these aims, but also used the funded research as a scaffold for four new projects, which I am currently developing. Some of these projects have already yielded publications, and my intention is to apply for funding to support each individually. These projects are: 3D collective behaviour, exploring the psychological mechanisms behind orientation, human 3D orientation and 3D magnetoreception.
