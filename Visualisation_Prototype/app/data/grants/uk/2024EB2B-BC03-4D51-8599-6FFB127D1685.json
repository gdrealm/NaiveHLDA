This lack of critical attention seems to imply that they are marginal, nostalgic, and anomalous, in contrast with other creative sub-sectors such as 'digital media'. Yet craft guilds display a very distinctive combination of notable characteristics: unusually longstanding and resilient, with deep historical roots and wide cultural trajectories; typically artist-maker led; specific to a particular range of practices; quality-controlled through specialised aesthetics of skill, born of long apprenticeship; spatially-defined, with primarily rural 'county' memberships of considerable size; producing work which is the most accessible form of artistic experience for millions of people. As such, their internal governance is deeply implicated in a key range of distinctions and working practices with long histories and complex politics and geographies. The research will examine both the organisation and management of guilds and their functions for their supporting membership within the craft economy. Bringing together both governance and practices, it will interrogate just how rich in contemporary relevance these are for the wider development policies of the 'creative industries', which have recently been given such high national economic priority. \\n\\nAttention will therefore be given to situating guilds within the formal governance of the sector at regional, national and international scales. This will include the historical context of guild organisation and the links to policy-led, sector-wide, support initiatives in the twentieth and twenty-first century. It is timely to note that the activities that the supposedly 'marginal' guilds have traditionally organised are precisely those now being aspired to in support of the 'new' broader creative industrial economy - networking, mentoring, supporting micro-businesses, promoting new markets and fostering innovation. Investigating the geographies of guild activities will address key issues here: the dynamics of networking; the sustenance of practitioner-led communities of practice; long-term mechanisms for supporting lone practitioners in peripheral areas; product and market innovation.\\n\\nThe place of the guild in the creative life of its membership will also be examined. Historically, guild's have been understood to offer practitioners a variety of opportunities to network with their peers, display and sell their work, access continued professional development, and be part of a practitioner led network that champions their craft at a regional, national and international scale. This research will ask practitioners about the role and value of the guild in their practice over the course of their career. Given the powerful legacy of the Arts and Crafts movement with its ethos of mutuality and socialist principles, this research will seek to understand the moral and ethical politics embedded in guild members' practices. By investigating the politics of craft in a historical context, the research will seek to question and understand the implications of craft politics for contemporary guild organisations. \\n\\nThis research will offer a historically and geographically situated analysis of contemporary guilds within the broader context of the creative industries. At present the craft industry contributes &pound;3 billion GVA to the UK economy (with an estimated potential for further growth of 63%) and employs up 13% of people working within the creative sector (around 88,000 people) many of whom hold guild membership. There are over 100 self-defined craft guilds operating across the UK and many more guild-styled associations. The research will consider the role of contemporary craft guilds in fostering development and innovation for their members, and will bring out the value that understanding guild practices can deliver to the wider creative economy.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/I001778/1","grantId":"AH/I001778/1","fundValue":"159909","fundStart":"2012-01-09","fundEnd":"2014-05-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Nicola  Thomas","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Exeter","findingsText":" This research interrogates the contemporary relevance of craft guilds in the wider development of the UK creative economy through an analysis of policy and practice. Working with the Devon Guild of Craftsman and Gloucestershire Guild of Craftsmen alongside organisations that support the craft sector in the UK the research has considered the specificities of guilds as an organisational model within the craft sector and broader creative economy. The research addresses past and present Craft Guilds, situating contemporary Guilds within the longer history of craft sector development. The project has addressed the activities that craft guilds have traditionally organised, recognizing that such practices are precisely those now being aspired to in support of the new creative economy.
