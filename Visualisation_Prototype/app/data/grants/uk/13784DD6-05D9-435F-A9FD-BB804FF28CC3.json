{"id":"13784DD6-05D9-435F-A9FD-BB804FF28CC3","title":"Developing a novel web-based tool for functional annotation of proteins","abstractText":"Every living cell within an organism contains thousands of different protein molecules. Although we know the biological function or role for most of these proteins, for 40% or so of the proteins in a typical human cell, for example, have no known function - although we are fairly certain that they do indeed have a function. Some people refer to this set of unknown genes as the 'dark matter' within the genome i.e. we know the genes are present but we simply do not know why there are there. Function can be described in many different ways, and given that the interactions of groups of proteins are perhaps the most important types of processes occurring within cells, describing the function of a protein by the interactions it makes with other proteins (i.e. in the form of networks) is clearly a good approach. Knowing how these protein molecules correctly bind together, or interact, can even help us to understand when something goes wrong within the machinery of a cell, for example during aging processes. This in turn will allow us to better understand disease or aging and will also perhaps help us to develop medicines to correct the faulty machinery. By taking data from many different experimental sources, all from publicly available databases, computers can help us to successfully predict the function of a protein based on, for example, determining what other proteins it interacts with and in what genes are switched on in synchrony with the protein's own encoding gene. We can also look at component features of a protein, such as which parts might be embedded in the membranes surrounding the cell or what kind of overall shape the protein might have. This project seeks to develop new computer programs to analyse these sorts of data and thus help biologists deduce the functions of the many genes and the proteins they encode whose functions are currently unknown. These programs and predictions will be made available via the World Wide Web, so that biologists can easily make use of our results for their own research work with just a PC and a standard web browser. This should greatly help with research into how cells work and how they might go wrong during disease or aging. Ultimately, such discoveries might even lead to the development of new drugs and treatments or even new industrial processes for synthesising useful chemicals.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I023992/1","grantId":"BB/I023992/1","fundValue":"119784","fundStart":"2011-10-04","fundEnd":"2013-03-03","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Our publicly available computational tools are used by both academics and commercial users, and we estimate that around 15% of our 800 user jobs per day are from the commercial sector.\n\nSome aspects of this work has also resulted in a new 3 year collaborative project between UCL and Elsevier (contract signed in November 2014) to look at how information can be usefully mined from literature sources and used to help identify the functions of uncharacterised genes and proteins.

FFPred is a computational tool that allows prediction of the functional characterisation of human and other eukaryotic proteins employing a technique called Feature-based Function Prediction. In order to do this, FFPred uses machine learning techniques and tools (called Support Vector Machines), which exploit the biologically relevant &quot;features&quot; that can be extracted from the sequence of a query protein, making no use of structural data and limited use of comparisons between multiple sequences, or homology information.\nAs a consequence, a critical step for the proper functioning of FFPred is the training of its machine learning algorithms and tools. Much of the work funded by this grant was devoted to developing a series of procedures that allow FFPred's prediction tools to be trained in a mostly automated, reproducible way, starting from the basic input of public databases available at the time of training.\nWhile doing this, a new version of FFPred itself was implemented, which utilises state-of-the-art third party software (this is needed to extract some of the sequence &quot;features&quot; for the query protein) and biological databases, runs in a more streamlined way and gives an output that is simpler to interpret.\n\nAdditionally, work was performed to make FFPred available to the community not only via the web interface (that was improved with a new layout for the results section), but also as a standalone program that can be downloaded as a package for Unix/Linux based platforms, as documented in the corresponding publication. The improved version of FFPred can now be easily and freely accessed by researchers from all over the world, via both download of a standalone software package and a web interface. Also, as a result of work on this grant, FFPred's machine learning algorithms are now in the condition of being easily trained again by other researchers in the group, as more data on functional characterisation of human proteins is expected to become available in the near future.\nEven more interestingly, it can be thought to expand and adapt FFPred to other organisms, in order to contribute to discoveries and development in the bioinformatics analysis of eukaryotic proteomes in general. This idea is currently being actively tested in the group, and it seems to yield useful results at least for some other widely researched model organisms.\n\nFurthermore, the implementation and ideas used by FFPred can suggest new ways of thinking about function prediction. For instance, the idea of feature-based sequence analysis is being implemented in a new tool for search of functionally related proteins, that has been prototyped in our group for use by collaborators in experimental biology projects. \nIn particular, new components in this version of FFPred may be easily taken forward and influence other sectors of protein bioinformatics analysis. This is evident for example in the case of its new Cellular Component section, which allows to predict sub-cellular localisation of query proteins, and that shows great potential after recent benchmark testing in an international experiment (the second Critical Assessment of Function Annotation).
