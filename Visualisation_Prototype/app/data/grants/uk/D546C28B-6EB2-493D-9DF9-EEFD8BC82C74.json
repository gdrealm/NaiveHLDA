This technology is popular primarily due to the reduced cost of the partially rated power electronic converter. On the negative side is the fact that the generator requires brushes and slip rings which require regular maintainance.An alternative scheme is based on the brushless doubly-fed reluctance machine (BDFRM) which also has the cost benefit of a partially rated power converter but as its name implies does not require brushes and slip rings.The BDFRM has not been used for a wind power application. This project will experimentally examine its performance for a wind power application. There are a number of different approaches to the control of a BDFRM. The project will examine the use of Direct Power Control (DPC). This control approach will include sensorless operation and machine parameter independence. With the proliferation of wind power generation the issue of power system stabilty is of great concern. It is important to examine the fault-ride-through (FRT) capabilty of any generation system. This project will examine the FRT capability of the BDFRM and compare this to that of the DFIG. This will require that special grid fault emulation equipment is included in the laboratory test rig.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F061714/1","grantId":"EP/F061714/1","fundValue":"135326","fundStart":"2008-09-22","fundEnd":"2011-09-21","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"David John Atkinson","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":" Doubly-Fed generator systems are in widespread use for large wind turbine systems. There is concern over the performance of these systems during grid faults. Various national grid codes have been developed to specify generator performance during fault conditions which is known as Fault-Ride-Through (FRT) capability.\n\nIn collaboration with Northumbria University this project investigated two different doubly-fed generator technologies with a view to understanding there performance in both healthy and faulted circumstances. The schemes studied were the commonly used Doubly-Fed Induction Generator (DFIG) and the less well known Brushless Doubly-Fed Reluctance Generator (BDFRG). Both of these generator technologies require power electronic converters to control machine excitation and power flow. \n\nThe project investigated both of these machine with computer simulation and experimental testing. A special BDFRG was manufactured by a project collaborator at Shenyang University of Technology. Test rigs for DFIG and BDFRG were constructed to allow studies to be carried out during healthy and grid fault conditions. \n\nConverter and control electronics were developed to allow different control algorithms to be tested on the generator systems. Vector Control, Direct Torque Control and Direct Power Control systems were examined experimentally. The DFIG system using Vector Control was examined for grid fault conditions. The impact of different control systems on DFIG FRT performance was included in the study.\n\nWith regard to DFIG fault-ride-through performance two control schemes were examined. The first scheme was based on the rotor circuit crowbar protection mechanism in common use. The research addressed the minimization of the crowbar application period to improve transient response during grid faults. This crowbar was engaged and disengaged in accordance with rotor current magnitude. \n\nThe application of an alternative protection technique obtained by using a DC-link brake chopper to contain the DC-link voltage while accepting transient rotor over-currents has also been investigated. The scheme required the use of higher rated inverter anti-parallel diodes. \n\nOverall, as a stand-alone method the crowbar is preferred; particularly in terms of the rapidity with which full control may be restored. A DC-brake may nonetheless be considered valuable for converters with low values of DC-link capacitance; these may be more sensitive to incoming over-currents. The results of this research will find use in improving the grid fault handling capability of new and existing large wind turbine systems. The core of the work has been focused on developments in the digital control algorithms to improve the generator behavior during the fault condition. Application of the techniques developed can enhance the contribution the generator makes to voltage support during the fault period and therefore helps with power system stability. Manufacturers of wind power generator systems can incorporate the control schemes into their control hardware to enhance their product capabilities in meeting grid code requirements.
