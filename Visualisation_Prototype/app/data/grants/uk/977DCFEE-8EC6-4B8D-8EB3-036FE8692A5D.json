{"id":"977DCFEE-8EC6-4B8D-8EB3-036FE8692A5D","title":"Scheduling with Resource and Job Patterns","abstractText":"The project will bring together two streams of scheduling research which involve patterns of different types: resource patterns and job patterns. Resource patterns are typical for personnel scheduling problems and for project management; job patterns are usually studied within machine scheduling. In spite of the differences in the nature of two types of patterns and the differences in application areas for two types of problems, there are a number of complementary features in the underlying models which have not been explored in the past. Within this project, we intend to complete the in-depth analysis of the two models, perform the knowledge exchange between the two areas and develop a new methodological framework for solving problems with patterns. The study of the separate problems with resource patterns and those with job patterns will be concluded with the study of the combined problem with both types of patterns, which models new features of real-world applications not studied before.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K041274/1","grantId":"EP/K041274/1","fundValue":"24165","fundStart":"2013-07-31","fundEnd":"2016-01-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Natalia  Shakhlevich","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
