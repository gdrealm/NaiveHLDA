As these datasets comprise human populations from the entire globe, it is tempting to look at the geographic distribution of genetic variants and try to find explanations for why some variants are more common in some places rather than others. After all, we have known for a long time that sickle cell anaemia is found in regions where malaria was prevalent, as it can confer resistance to the deadly disease. So, could we find other important genetic variants that have been affected by natural selection by examining their geographic distribution? While this approach sounds promising, it raises the issue of being able to distinguish between those patterns that truly reflect past and present selection, and patterns that might have simply arisen by chance. In this project, we propose to develop a population genetics framework that will allow us to reconstruct the spread of anatomically modern humans around the globe, taking into account past changes in climate and the shape of continents. By knowing how and when people got to different parts of the world, we will then be able to distinguish which genetic variants have geographic distributions too extreme to be the result of mere chance, and thus have been the target of natural selection. Besides looking for regions under selection in the nuclear genome, we will also consider the small amount of genetic material contained in the mitochondria, small organelles that act as the biochemical powerhouses in our cells. Mitochondrial DNA is arguably the most widely used source of information for reconstructing human past history, but such reconstructions rely on the assumption that mitochondrial DNA has not been affected by natural selection. Our new framework, together with a better geographic coverage of mitochondrial genetic variability that will be achieved in this project, will allow us to test the assumption of neutrality and to find any deviation that should be taken into account in future work on human settlement history.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/H008691/1","grantId":"BB/H008691/1","fundValue":"146934","fundStart":"2010-09-01","fundEnd":"2013-08-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The primary software resource is the ReseqTrack infrastructure, which was originally developed to support data coordination and management in the 1000 Genomes Project. Results from common human genotyping arrays were tested with the imputation pipeline and compared to reference implementation and data sets to ensure accuracy before release. we have extensively validated our variant calling infrastructure using the above software for both whole genome sequencing and exome sequencing use cases using the independently generated 1000 Genomes and UK10K project data sets for validation. We have also developed modules that enable the rapid identification of functional variation based on Ensembl annotations and using the Ensembl Variant Effector Predictor (VEP) software.

We have tested and used this software in several very demanding situations and will continue to do so in the context of the research questions in this grant and as appropriate in other situations. We created computer software to enable the effective management of data arising from model biology research. Specifically, methods for determining how people's genomes differ from each other generate very large amounts of data called sequenced. Genome sequences contain the information from our parents that not only make us look like our parents, but give us some of the same disease risks. Genome sequences also contribute to what makes us different from each other in various ways including height, hair colour and other details. These differences are known to be associated with where people come from including both obvious characteristics like red hair in northern Europeans and less obvious characteristics, such as sensitivity to temperature, which are the focus of this proposal. The software is therefore applicable to other datasets of this type; all of our software is open source and freely available for those who wish to use it.\n\nWe originally used our software to support the data coordination and management for the world-wide 1000 Genomes Project and is it is especially suited for cases when there are genome sequences or other genetic information from a large number of individuals. In this project we updated and extended the capabilities of our software in several key ways. For example, we added new features to support other types of data analysis including methods for estimating the full genome sequence from tests (like those currently provided by 23andme) that actually measure a small fraction of genome. We have also engineered our software to be much more efficient. Additional software development was done to enable it to be run in a fully secure environment which is required by some research studies to protect the privacy of the research participants genome data.
