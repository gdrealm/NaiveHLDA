The large values of intrinsic permittivity suggests some (as yet unknown) form of additional polarisation, other than ionic polarisation plays an important role in these compounds and that ACu3Ti4O12-type materials possess fundamentally interesting dielectric behaviour and potentially useful bulk dielectric properties after appropriate chemical doping. The aim of this study is therefore to prepare and characterise a wide variety of undoped and Mn-doped ACu3B4O12-type compounds to establish their structure-composition-property relationships. Particular emphasis will be given to optimising the bulk dielectric properties to assess their potential as commercially-useful high permittivity and/or temperature-stable dielectrics.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E040578/1","grantId":"EP/E040578/1","fundValue":"333700","fundStart":"2007-04-01","fundEnd":"2010-07-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Information has been used only by the scientific (academic community) who are still trying to understand the defect chemistry in CCTO.

This effect has been widely reported to occur in both single-crystals and ceramics of CaCu3Ti4O12 (CCTO) and had led to the belief that it is an intrinsic effect related to the unusual perovskite-type crystal structure as opposed to an extrinsic effect associated with grain boundaries, surface layers and/or sample-electrode contact phenomena. The crystal symmetry of all these materials is cubic and this normally precludes such high permittivity values. In addition, they are semiconducting rather than dielectric materials. Serious anomalies therefore exist between the crystal structure and electrical property relationships in these materials.\n\n\n\nThe main results are summarized below.\n\n(i) A combination of electrical property measurements on single-crystals and ceramics of CCTO showed, conclusively, that it is an extrinsic effect that is responsible for the giant permittivity and that its origin is different for single crystals and ceramics. For single crystals it is associated with a non-ohmic electrode contact to semiconducting CCTO. For ceramics it is attributed (primarily) to an internal barrier layer capacitor mechanism associated with semiconducting CCTO grains and insulating grain boundaries. The intrsinic permittivity is higher than expected from calculations and shows strong temperature dependence.\n\n(ii) A wide variety (43 in total) of compounds were prepared based on various stoichiometries and combinations of A and B-type ions, eg La2/3Cu3Ti4O12, Cu2Ta4O12 and NaCu3Ti3TaO12. The A-site cation plays an important role in the magnitude of the intrinsic permittivity as does the Ti-content on the B-site. Members containing Bi3+ ions on the A-site, e.g., Na1/2Bi1/2Cu3Ti4O12 (NBCTO) and Bi2/3Cu3Ti4O12, have the highest values with e ~ 200 at ~ 100 K rising to ~ 250 at ~ 10 K. An infrared and time-domain terahertz spectroscopy study on NBCTO ceramics revealed a RT polar optic mode that softens on cooling. This soft-mode is responsible for the strong temperature dependence of permittivity and confirms incipient ferroelectricity in NBCTO. This established the intrinsic crystal structure-permittivity properties of these perovskites.\n\n(iii) Mn-doping at the Cu-site suppressed the grain semiconductivity in ACu3Ti4O12 compounds by six orders of magnitude at RT. Mn-doped ceramics display high RT permittivity values of ~ 93 (CCTO) and 130 (NBCTO) and modest mw properties (Q.f ~ 2000 - 4000 GHz), however the temperature stability of the permittivity is poor (temperature coefficient of resonant frequency, tf ~ + 600 - 1000 ppm/K) due to their incipient ferroelectricity.\n\n(iv) Composites of Mn-doped ACu3Ti4O12 (+ve tf) with sphene (CaTiSiO5, -ve tf) were fabricated to obtain ceramics with zero tf near RT. This was achieved for 60 % (ACu3Ti4O12): 40% Sphene with e ~ 60 and Q.f ~ 1100 GHz; however the zero tf range was limited to ~ 40-60 C. It is unlikely that Mn-doped ACu3Ti4O12 will find industrial applications as mw dielectrics as these properties are inferior to existing materials; however, a new family of incipient ferroelectric oxides have been established. To use the data handling methods for analysing impedance spectroscopy data developed during this project to evaluate electrically heterogeneous ceramics with so-called giant permittivity effects. This allows intrinsic and extrinsic contributions towards permittivity to be fully established.\n\nTo be cautious in attributing giant permittivity in transition metal oxides to an intrinsic polarisation phenomenon.
