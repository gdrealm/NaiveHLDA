{"id":"B6511B42-D90C-45AF-9CA0-9801D4CDAD7F","title":"Novel Multi-target Distance Metrology for Multi-probe Application using Chirped Laser","abstractText":"This 3 year project intends to develop a new high repetition mode hop free chirped laser that allows major enhancements in an combined multilateration (CM) instrument. This will enable additional distance measurements to be carried out at an accuracy of 0.1mm over a distance of 10m. This project will require an experienced RA to develop the laser and detection system so that a state of the art instrument can be realised. The RA will be expected to work closely with NPL and be based at their facility in the third year. The research will produce an instrument that greatly simplifies manufacturing measurements without compromising accuracy. Commercially, this instrument will have a market potential of 10m/year and will provide enormous added value to the UK's manufacturing potential.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I029613/1","grantId":"EP/I029613/1","fundValue":"425642","fundStart":"2011-06-01","fundEnd":"2014-11-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Nigel Joseph Copner","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Glamorgan","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
