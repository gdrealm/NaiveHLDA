Olivers","abstractText":"<p>In everyday life we are bombarded by multiple stimuli and efficient behaviour depends on our ability to select information that is relevant to our current goals and to ignore irrelevant information. There has been much research over the past 20 years into how we select stimuli based on their spatial locations (where an object is in the environment). However, we are also able to use the temporal properties of objects to select new stimuli, so that a complete account of human selection will require us to specify the temporal as well as the spatial processes involved.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This grant will involve detailed experimental tests of the temporal as well as the spatial aspects of human visual selection. The work will use measures derived from visual search and temporal limits on selection (the ‘attentional blink’) to build up a detailed model of human selection mechanisms. A particularly novel focus will be to examine how attention is influenced by our intentions to act, and not just by the properties of the stimuli being presented.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-0271","grantId":"RES-062-23-0271","fundValue":"157869","fundStart":"2008-03-01","fundEnd":"2012-02-29","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Glyn  Humphreys","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":" The project presented novel evidence for the influence of two action-related components on human visual attention: the role of action-related properties of stimuli in an image (visual affordance) and the role of motor preparation (often in response to the appropriate action properties - motor affordance). The studies using converging evidence from different methodologies including: behavioural studies with normal participants, neuropsychological studies with patients with impaired attention, electrophysiological studies (EEG) and functional brain imaging (fMRI). The results demonstrated that action-related information in an image can direct visual attention whilst also rapidly cueing a motor action which, in turn, can feed-back to modulate attention. The work, and the conclusion for dual (perceptual and motor-based) mechanisms of attentional modulation by action, provides important new refinements on our understanding of human visual attention. The research has implications for developing action-related therapies to help patients overcome attentionla disorders (eg unilateral neglect after stroke). The work has been published in nine journal papers, including leading outlets in the field (Journal of Experimental Psychology). The research has been presented at 10 conferences including at keynote addresses at the Vision Sciences Society. The implications of the research for understanding neuropsychological disorders have also been disseminated at conferences and workhops for rehabilitation therapists working with patients with attentional impairments.
