{"id":"4F0D7745-4ABC-4190-86C0-BCCFE6676A8C","title":"MIST: Museum Interfaces, Spaces, Technologies","abstractText":"Museums are the repositories of our cultural heritage. They have the often contradictory roles of protecting our heritage and providing access to it. The MIST network will explore these two roles by discussing what kind of places museums are, what they could be and how new thinking on space and technology could transform the kind of access they can provide. We will the define and begin the development of new technologies and new ways of embedding technologies that will make museum visits (both real visits and virtual visits via the website) more meaningful and exciting. These technologies may well include physical interfaces that make ephemeral digital representations tangible; ways of using the web and objects taken from the museums to embed a museum visit within the life of a visitor, providing him or her with pre-visit information and post-visit memory aids and routes to further development; and ways of connecting the museum space with people and spaces outside. \\n\\n\\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/H018360/1","grantId":"AH/H018360/1","fundValue":"12151","fundStart":"2010-01-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Robert  Zimmer","coPersons":["Francois  Penz"],"organisation":"Goldsmiths College","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
