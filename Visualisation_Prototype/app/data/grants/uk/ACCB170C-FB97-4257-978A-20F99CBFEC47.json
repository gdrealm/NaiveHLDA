{"id":"ACCB170C-FB97-4257-978A-20F99CBFEC47","title":"Developing a Methodology for Social Network Sampling","abstractText":"Interaction networks are studied by a wide variety of researchers and are known to be vital to understanding important processes including disease spread, information transmission, and food-web regulation. Thus, they are important for understanding the ecological pressures imposed on animals and their environments and, in the case of disease transmission, important for developing preventative methods for conserving wildlife. Sampling is necessary because animal social networks are generally large. For example, although a feral cat may come into contact with only thirty other cats, some of these contacts will be connected to individuals outside the original group of thirty; so the social network for UK feral cats may easily involve thousands of individuals. However, there is no quantitative methodology underpinning the collection of ecological network data. This can result in social network data being unreliable. This project will take an interdisciplinary approach to solving the problem by building state-of-the-art computer models to simulate and test different network sampling protocols and to define a robust quantitative methodology for data collection.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/E016111/1","grantId":"NE/E016111/1","fundValue":"109882","fundStart":"2007-07-01","fundEnd":"2010-06-30","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  Biologists have used my findings to inform a) design of social network data collection in the field and b) analysis of social network data. For example, our published paper on hypothesis testing for animal social networks has already been cited over 50 times and people have referenced it in their methods for studies from sharks to birds.

This is important as social network analysis is becoming widespread in biology and there is a need to understand how to correctly analyse the data. We also developed a computational tool for generating network structures that have user-defined distributions for network properties and for key measures of interest to ecologists. This tool was used to show how network structure is affected by sampling, and to give recommendations to ecologists on how to sample animal social networks. My research is being used by biologists to inform their fieldwork, when collecting animal social network data. Environment,Other","dataset":"gtr"}
