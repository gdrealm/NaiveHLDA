{"id":"FD41D359-1066-47C5-B930-C839F380FBDE","title":"Inverse Problems for Magnetic Induction Tomography","abstractText":"Magnetic Induction Tomography (MIT) is a relatively new, non-invasive imaging technique which has applications in both industrial and clinical settings. In essence, it is capable of reconstructing the electromagnetic parameters (permittivity, permeability and conductivity) of an object from measurements made on its surface. An MIT device consists of two sets of coils placed around the boundary of the object to be imaged. The first set of coils is used for the purpose of excitation, and by passing a current through each coil in turn, a primary magnetic field is created. The second set of coils is then used for measurement. This procedure causes an eddy current when each of the primary magnetic fields interacts with a conducting body inducing secondary magnetic fields, and hence voltages, that are measured in the second set of coils.\n\nEnabling MIT to take the step from being an experimental technique, which has already received some clinical interest, to become a viable imaging technique for the detection and monitoring of conditions, such as cerebral stroke, requires a step change in the quality of the reconstruction of the electromagnetic parameters and, therefore, an improvement of the computational approach used for the solution of the inverse problem. To achieve this we propose to solve the inverse Maxwell problem with a variational algorithm. Although a proof of concept of this work exists, in order to make this algorithm effective in a clinical environment, and hence applicable to the MIT problem, an implementation using high performance computing is needed, this research proposal aims to address this issue.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K023950/1","grantId":"EP/K023950/1","fundValue":"183787","fundStart":"2013-09-02","fundEnd":"2016-09-01","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The software developed as part of this proposal has been made available to our collaborators in Cardiff University who are in the process of developing parallel versions of our solution algorithms. We intend to release public versions of the software in due course. The additions and improvements to the Nedelec finite element implementation in Deal ii finite element library have been submitted to the open source project and should shortly be available for the wider community to use. The project been now only one year old remains in its early stages but, once fully developed 3D algorithms for MIT system have been completed we anticipate wider impact under the heading indicated below. Healthcare Societal","person":"Paul David Ledger","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Swansea University","findingsText":" The key achievements of this project to date are:\n\n1) The development of new iterative reconstruction process for recovering distributions of conductivity, permittivity and permeability from boundary measurements of electromagnetic fields. This new algorithm introduces adaptivity for the representation of the recovery process. This allows the algorithm to achieve higher fidelity reconstructions compared to traditional constant voxel approaches. Currently, the approach has been applied to model problems in 2D and the results presented at the BAMC conference in Cardiff in 2014. The extension to 3D problems is underway.\n\n2) The capability of the existing and established finite element library, Deal ii, for the solution of partial differential equations has been improved by correcting a series of issues and improved its capability to allow the solution of the Maxwell system on a wider class of geometries.\n\n3) The capability of existing finite element solver developed by one of the project team, P.D. Ledger, has been extended to allow the solution of the forward solution of the eddy current problem associated with Magnetic Induction Tomography. Simulated measurement of a full MIT system have been obtained including simulations of human head configuration and stroke. We are currently in the process of writing up our findings for a journal publication.\n\n4) This research project together with other research undertaken by the group of Dr P.D. Ledger has attracted the interest of Siemens and this has lead to further funding in the form of an EPSRC CASE award PhD studentship which is focused on the simulation magneto-mechanical vibrations in MRI scanners. At just over one year into our 3-year project, we have already made significant efforts to communicate our findings to the wider academic community. Specifically, we have presented the results of our research to the applied mathematics community nationally and at the British Applied Mathematics Colloquium, Cardiff University 2014 and at specialist one day inverse problems workshops at The University of Manchester and at The University of Leeds. We have engaged with our project partners, Professor Huw Griffiths and Dr Manuch Solemani, and sought their views on our latest developments. Going forward in the next 12 months we envisage presenting our results to the wider academic engineering community by attending appropriate conferences and writing a paper to promote our research to this audience.
