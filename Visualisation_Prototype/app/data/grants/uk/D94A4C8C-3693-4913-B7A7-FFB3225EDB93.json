In order to progress towards realistic device applications of graphene, it is important to address the issues which will affect the operation of graphene in real circuits, where high currents will lead to overheating and non-equilibrium charge carrier distributions. The proposed joint project will launch an internationally leading programme involving three research groups which are already well established in graphene research and have expertise in complimentary areas. By combining fabrication technology of graphene-based devices, transport and optical studies, and theoretical modelling, we will investigate the kinetic properties of charge carriers and phonons (lattice vibrations) in graphene over a broad range of operating voltages, temperatures and optical intensities, with the aim to establish and improve the operating characteristics of graphene-based electronic and optoelectronic devices.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G042357/1","grantId":"EP/G042357/1","fundValue":"341211","fundStart":"2010-02-19","fundEnd":"2013-02-18","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  This research has significant implications for applications of graphene in lasers, detectors and photovoltaic devices.

A detailed picture of the ultrafast dynamics was gained, defining the state of the art in the field. In particular, we identified the role of collinear scattering. This gives rise to Auger processes, including charge multiplication, which is key in photovoltage generation and photodetectors This research underpins the understanding of all graphene-based photonic devices exploiting non equilibrium carriers, such as mode-locked lasers, but also has important implications for photodetectors and photovoltage generation. Carrier multiplication could significant enhance the efficiency of these devices. A spin off company, Camlase ltd was funded, to exploit graphene as mode locker in ultrafast lasers. A patent was jointly submitted with IBM Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Chemicals,Construction,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Electronics,Energy,Environment,Healthcare,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Transport","dataset":"gtr"}
