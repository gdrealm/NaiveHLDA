{"id":"A8DCAEB0-543A-4CEC-A2E0-E400A8B6C13E","title":"Nonlinear interfacial waves with a free surface","abstractText":"The stratification of fluids in layers of different densities is a well-known phenomenon in nature. Waves can propagate at the interface between two superposed layers. Examples are the interfacial waves which occur at a sharp interface between two layers of water of different densities due to the variation in salinity. There are experimental observations of the so-called ``dead-water'' effect in oceans and of narrow V-wakes behind the ships in synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) images, which may be explained by presence of the interfacial waves interacting with the free surface.Both the interface and the free surface are unknown, and have to be found as part of the solution. The problem of finding these interfaces belong to the class of free boundary problems, which occur in many physical and biological applications. The wave system at the interface or at the free surface is determined by a surface-wave mode and an internal-wave mode. The presence of the free surface was usually neglected when the interfacial waves were investigated. The nonlinear coupling between the free surface and interface makes the problem much more difficult. We will study different types of nonlinear waves which may exist when the free surface is not neglected. The effect of the surface tension and interfacial tension will also be considered and the existence of different types of solitary waves will be in particular investigated in two and three dimensions. Fully nonlinear codes will be developed to tackle these problems. Time-dependent algorithms are planned to be developed to explore the stability of different types of steady waves computed in two and three dimensions.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H008489/1","grantId":"EP/H008489/1","fundValue":"101957","fundStart":"2010-03-22","fundEnd":"2012-03-21","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Emilian Ionica Parau","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of East Anglia","findingsText":" The stratification of fluids into layers of different densities is a well-known phenomenon in nature. For example, in the straits of Gibraltar, water from the Atlantic flows over the warmer, saltier Mediterranean water. In situations like these waves can travel along the top surface and also along the interface between the layers.\n\n\n\nWhen the top layer is shallow enough the surface and interfacial waves can interact, which can lead to the so-called ``dead-water'' effect observed at sea and in experiments. The characteristics of ``dead-water'' are a calm surface and a relatively large interfacial wave. This effect has been known to slow or even stop ships as they move through calm water. In a similar vein, interaction between waves on the interface and surface can explain the narrow V-shaped wakes observed behind ships in synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) images.\n\n\n\nWhen we have two fluid layers, the shapes of both the interface and the surface are unknown. The waves profiles can be shown to depend on the fluid densities, surface tension, interfacial tension and several other parameters. Finding these wave shapes belongs to the class of free-boundary problems, which occur in many physical and biological applications. In previous mathematical investigations the presence of a free surface was neglected, or approximated by a rigid lid. The coupling between the free surface and the interface makes the problem much more difficult. Here we allow waves to travel on both the interface and, importantly, the free surface.\n\n\n\nThe wave system at the interface or at the free surface is determined from the parameters. The wave speed is used to predict whether the wave is periodic or solitary. We found different types of waves, which exist when the free surface is included. The effect of the surface tension and interfacial tension, which is important in experiments, is also considered and different types of solitary waves are found. When a sufficiently strong surface tension is present only on the free surface, there is a region, or 'gap', between two non-zero wave speeds where solitary, and not periodic, waves are found. In this gap, in-phase and out-of-phase solitary waves are found. Damped oscillations appear in the tails of the solitary waves in certain cases. The crests of the out-of-phase waves broaden at critical values of the parameters. These wave profiles were found in a two-dimensional domain.\n\n\n\nThree-dimensional fully-localised solitary waves were also computed when the surface tension is present.\n\n\n\nA related fluid mechanics problem involving a coupling between two unknown surfaces appears when both the interface and the free surface are replaced by elastic plates. New nonlinear symmetric and anti-symmetric periodic waves were discovered.  ","dataset":"gtr"}
