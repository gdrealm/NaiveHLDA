{"id":"D24FA4AE-3CE8-4837-9C5D-A376444D0B2E","title":"Computer-Human Interactive Performance Symposium (CHIPS)","abstractText":"Popular music (e.g. folk, rock, music theatre) plays a central role in the lives of millions of people. Musicians of all standards from amateur to professional produce music that is heard on radios and televisions, and performed in concert halls and theatres. Teenagers are motivated to learn instruments and play in bands to emulate their professional idols, serious amateurs play and sing together at open-mike nights, charity concerts, and in churches, and professionals perform in clubs, theatres, and multimedia shows like Cirque du Soleil and the Blue Man Group. To learn, rehearse, and perform popular music often requires a musician to be part of an ensemble yet forming such a group can be challenging, particularly for amateur musicians. Even in established communities such as churches, the demands of everyday life mean that musicians cannot always attend rehearsals or play regularly together. In professional ensembles, illness can cause the absence of key musicians in rehearsal or performance. Computer music technology offers the potential to substitute for musicians in these situations, yet reliable, robust, and simple systems that can be quickly set up, and that play musically and creatively do not yet exist. To focus broader attention on this significant and potentially high-impact problem, the CHIPS project will form a network of interest around the computer-human performance of popular music. The aim is to understand and shape the future research agenda by learning from experiences of technological adoption in relevant contexts, understanding the technological state of the art in relation to popular music performance, and imagining future performance practices incorporating computer &quot;musicians&quot;. The focus of the project will be a symposium, supported before and after by web-enabled collaborative discussion, and with the longer-term aim of establishing a network of interest to subsequently organise a self-sustaining series of symposia or working sessions at relevant major international conferences in the field.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/J012408/1","grantId":"AH/J012408/1","fundValue":"17752","fundStart":"2012-02-14","fundEnd":"2012-09-13","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  The findings have informed the development of research proposals and agenda in the use of mobile devices for music-related applications. This was a short academically focused project thus to date minimal non-academic impact has been noted although a mobile-based public engagement/research project with the Royal College of Music has been in progress in 2014.

These were supplemented by theoretical work culminating in a music-technology adoption assessment framework published at Sound and Music Computing 2012. From the results of this work a collaborative feasiblity study was undertaken using beat tracking and chord estimation on the iOS platform. The results of the symposia and exploratory study could inform future research developments in the field.
