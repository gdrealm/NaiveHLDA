{"id":"4088D2EE-87F5-4F10-9B65-5D8A754DA844","title":"Governance of the Discontinuation of Socio-Technical Systems","abstractText":"<p>This project aims to help develop better understanding of how policy processes and wider industry and civil society strategies address deliberate abandonment of ‘sociotechnical systems’. Research teams in the UK, Netherlands, France and Germany will focus on case studies concerning nuclear power, DDT, incandescent light bulbs and petrol automobile engines.<br /><br />A 'sociotechnical system’ is bigger than an industrial sector. It includes entire supply chains from producers to end users, as well as cross-cutting services and all institutions and practices involved in related research, training, education, regulation and sponsorship. 'Governance' includes all actors and processes involved in co-ordinating such sstems, going beyond public policy bodies, through firms and regulators to wider civil society and social movements. Existing research and policy making tends to concentrate on processes associated with advancement and innovation, neglecting conditions for deliberate discontinuation.<br /><br />The project will collect empirical data on termination processes in each case study area. It will&nbsp; analyse processes of coordination and conflict between different levels of policy making and so develop a typology of 'discontinuation pathways' and a framework to explore the main driving or obstructing factors. The result will aid deeper understanding of ways more effectively to make sociotechnical transitions.<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K006371/1","grantId":"ES/K006371/1","fundValue":"380870","fundStart":"2013-01-31","fundEnd":"2016-07-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Andy  Stirling","coPersons":["Frank Willem Geels"],"organisation":"University of Sussex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
