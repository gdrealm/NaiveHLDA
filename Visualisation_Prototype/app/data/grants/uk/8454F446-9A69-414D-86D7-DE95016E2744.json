The difficulty lies in their extreme weakness in generating observable changes in the position of test masses. As with electromagnetic waves, gravitational waves will exist at a wide range of frequencies and observing the universe using them will allow us to study a wide range of different objects and astrophysical situations. Low frequency gravitational waves cannot be detected from the ground because the signals are swamped by the presence of seismic noise from Earth movement and the effects of human motion. In space these problems are absent and so the first attempt to detect low frequency gravitational waves will be the LISA mission which will have the sensitivity to observe a range of binary stars whose gravitational radiation properties can already be predicted. LISA will consist of three spacecraft each containing proof masses which will move in response to the tidal effects of the gravitational wave. The technology to detect gravitational waves from space platforms is rather new and it cannot be completely tested in the gravitational field of the Earth. For this reason a test mission is being planned called the LISA Pathfinder. This will contain a package of instruments which will test the ability of the proof masses on LISA to be accurately controlled and also to demonstarte that the residual noise experienced in space is low enough to allow the gravitational waves to be detected. Birmingham University is part of the team providing the instrumentation to measure the proof mass position by means of phase changes in a laser beam.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=PP/C507129/1","grantId":"PP/C507129/1","fundValue":"1287060","fundStart":"2004-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-12-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"A Mike Cruise","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
