Helminth infection is often associated with pronounced effects on the health of the infected individual host. An example of such a parasite is the human whipworm that infects 1 billion people worldwide. An analogous model system exists in the mouse that allows us to study the interaction between the whipworm and the host?s immune system and understand the mechanisms by which the host attempts to eradicate the worm. The site of whipworm infection in the large intestine is home to the host?s gut flora, these bacteria are important in the development and maintenance of the host?s immune response and in digesting complex dietary molecules. We have data showing that in a chronic whipworm infection in the mouse there are dramatic changes in the gut flora of the infected animal. In this research we aim to precisely define these changes in the gut flora following whipworm infection and then to understand the functional implications to the host as a result of these changes. Specifically, do the changes in gut flora provide a new ecosystem in the gut more beneficial to long term worm survival? Do they compromise the ability of the infected individual to digest complex carbohydrates thereby leading to long-term weight loss? Finally, do these changes in gut flora have implications on the way we mount immune responses e.g. to other infectious agents or in terms of immune disease such as autoimmunity or allergy.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1100076","grantId":"G1100076","fundValue":"440484","fundStart":"2011-08-01","fundEnd":"2014-07-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Ian Stanley Roberts","coPersons":["Richard Karl Grencis","David  Robertson"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
