Hegel's Philosophy of Right is widely acknowledged to be one of the most important works in the history of political philosophy. Modern scholars are in virtual agreement that Hegel had intended his Philosophy of Right to be interpreted not as an independent text, but as a significant part of his greater system of speculative philosophy. Where scholars disagree is on the question of the relevance of Hegel's larger philosophical system to an understanding the Philosophy of Right.\n\nMy research will demonstrate that Hegel scholars can be put into two broad camps: those who adhere to a &quot;systematic&quot; reading and those who do not. Scholars in the first camp take more seriously Hegel's self-understanding of his project: that the Philosophy of Right is a part of the larger philosophical system and that this system has an explanatory role in helping us understand the Philosophy of Right. Scholars in the second &quot;non-systematic&quot; camp deny, in particular, that Hegel's system is significant to a proper understanding of the Philosophy of Right. The vast majority of scholars working on the Philosophy of Right are in this second camp.\n\nThis research project will make a clear contribution to the literature on Hegel's Philosophy of Right. It will be the first book on the topic to take Hegel's system of speculative philosophy seriously as an important component of any robust understanding of Hegel's Philosophy of Right.\nMy project will first set out this difference between &quot;systematic&quot; and &quot;non&shy; systematic&quot; readings of Hegel's Philosophy of Right before discussing important, relevant features of Hegel's system, in particular, the unique structure of his philosophical arguments. I will then spend most of my attention on the payoff from mv systematic reading by exploring several key areas of Hegel's political and legal philosophy, such as his theories of property, punishment, morality, poverty, law, monarchy, and war. In each case, my primary goal will be to offer an interprtation that best fits Hegel's intentions in his Philosophy of Right while demonstrating that this understanding is far more consistent with his text---challenging conventional interpretations in every case. By looking beyond this text to his larger philosophical system, we can achieve an improved understanding of Hegel's Philosophy of Right.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/E506232/1","grantId":"AH/E506232/1","fundValue":"20586","fundStart":"2007-02-02","fundEnd":"2007-06-01","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Thomas Alan Kieran  Brooks","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
