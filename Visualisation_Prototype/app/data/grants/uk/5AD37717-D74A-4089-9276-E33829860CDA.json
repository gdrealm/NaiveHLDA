{"id":"5AD37717-D74A-4089-9276-E33829860CDA","title":"SuperSTEM: HAADF/EELS Investigation of Multifunctional Ceramics","abstractText":"Functional ceramics are important components in a wide range of domestic, leisure and industrial electronic systems. These include microwave dielectrics in mobile telephone systems, pressure sensitive materials used as detectors in control and positioning systems (for example cameras and automobiles), electrical protection devices in domestic and industrial environments, and novel materials which could be used in future device memory and energy generation systems. Improvement in these materials and the development of new materials depends critically on knowledge of the structure and chemistry of the materials at the atomic level. We will use the SuperSTEM electron microscope to investigate the structure and the position/distribution of individual dopant ions and vacancies in the lattice, in sub-grain features including twin boundaries, in anti-phase boundaries and domain boundaries, and the grain boundaries of functional ceramics including:microwave dielectrics, lead-free piezoelectrics, ceramics with grain boundary controlled properties, multiferroics and thermoelectrics .","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H043462/1","grantId":"EP/H043462/1","fundValue":"10964","fundStart":"2010-10-29","fundEnd":"2011-12-28","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Robert  Freer","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
