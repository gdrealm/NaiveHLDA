{"id":"03C0DFBA-5942-4C01-8D15-44AFC20E8C46","title":"Integrated approach to cost effective production of biodiesel from photosynthetic microbes","abstractText":"Development of Renewable Fuels is an important consideration in terms of replacing fossil fuels, such as mineral oils and coals, as well as reducing the level of CO2 emissions associated with them. In this project we will develop two micro-algae to fix atmospheric CO2 and convert it using sunlight into raw material for biodiesel production. The main obstacles which have to be overcome are to develop strains of algae which can grow at high temperature [as flue gasses are going to be used as the source of CO2] as well as efficiently converting the CO2 into carbon compounds which can be used as raw materials for Biodiesel production. The work is being undertaken with a major Biofuels manufacturer and the knowledge gained should advance us both scientifically and industrially.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/H014233/1","grantId":"BB/H014233/1","fundValue":"823495","fundStart":"2009-11-01","fundEnd":"2014-10-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  the grant has permitted interaction between the academic researchers and staff at a major Fuel distribution company including both the scientists and the CEO. Exchange of information on biodiesel production has led to a better understanding of the industrial requirements and practical issues of producing a product suitable for inclusion as a drop-in fuel. The general interest in biofuels has resulted in a greater interest amongst students (high school and university) to learn of the research and participate more directly.

We also understand better how to make different fatty acids which could be used in both health (e.g. omega-3 fatty acids) or biofuels in larger quantities. The ability to genetically-modify a wide range of marine microalgae will allow other scientists to also investigate the use of microalgae for industrial uses.
