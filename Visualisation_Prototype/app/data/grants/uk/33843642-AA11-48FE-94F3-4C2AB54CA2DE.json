{"id":"33843642-AA11-48FE-94F3-4C2AB54CA2DE","title":"The Legends of Saints Agatha and Lucy in Early Spanish Literature","abstractText":"RESEARCH CONTEXT: The female virgin martyr is a neglected figure. Some thematic work, notably that of Winstead ('Virgin Martyrs'), has been undertaken in relation to Middle English, while editions of the legends of the major virgin martyrs in other languages have appeared only sporadically. The absence of research in relation to Spanish literature is more striking, for with the exception of my treatment of Agnes (in press), not one of the remaining narratives has received critical attention. The only partial exception is the transcription of Ba&ntilde;os &amp; Ur&iacute;a ('La leyenda'), which offers single manuscript versions of two abbreviated legends without commenting on their significance. The paucity of work in the area is potentially confusing. The virgin martyr, the dominant female saintly paradigm, provided male authors in a variety of genres with an image of virtuous female behaviour. Recent critical developments in gender and misogyny (for instance, Archer's 'Misoginia y defensa') have increased our understanding of gendered attitudes and the construction of gendered paradigms, but in view of the absence of reliable editions or discussions of saints' lives, they make no reference to hagiography. \\n\\nAIMS &amp; OBJECTIVES: The project aims to complete the first significant analysis and edition of the legends of Saints Agatha and Lucy. The saints have been chosen because they are unique in the virgin martyr tradition, with the female Agatha (rather than the male Christ) providing the principal source of inspiration for Lucy, firstly as she converts her mother (a rare example of female evangelism), and then, as she resists the sexualised tortures inflicted upon her by the forces of Roman authority. Equally unique is the role of the female procuress and go-between, Aphrodisia, who fails to break Agatha's will when she is imprisoned in a brothel. The project seeks to determine (Chapter 1) the origin of the two legends and their evolution in Greek and Latin through to their incorpation into Jacobus de Voragine's 'Golden Legend' (ca.1260), the most influential hagiographic compendium of the Middle Ages. Particular attention will be paid to literary borrowings and to the reasons why the two Sicilian martyrs came to be linked in local tradition. Chapter 2 contexualises these findings, firstly by discussing the typology of female sanctity in Voragine, and then, by isolating aspects of the virgin martyr tradition unique to Agatha and Lucy. Chapter 3 discusses the reworking of Voragine's Latin into Castilian, showing how Agatha's legend can be found in seven manuscripts, and Lucy's in six, none of which have been edited. The chapter is underpinned by a systematic analysis of translation methodology which shows that the thirteen manuscripts distil into four distinct texts (two long versions and two short versions for each saint). Chapter 4 offers a detailed reading of the content and significance of the legends, looking principally at the establishment of gendered paradigms evolving from specific degradations of the physical body (both saints are threatened by forced imprisonment in brothels, while Agatha has her breasts severed and Lucy is lacerated and drenched in urine). Chapter 5 presents editions of the four texts supported by a full critical apparatus.\\n\\nAPPLICATIONS &amp; BENEFITS: The project will: provide a standard work of reference for research into the origin and meaning of the cults of Agatha and Lucy in European literature; shed further light on the compilation of the 'Golden Legend' (complementing Reames' 'Paradoxical History'); heighten critical understanding of the dissemination of Voragine's work in Spain (expanding on my previous work in the area); contribute to critical discussions of gendered paradigms of behaviour in hagiography and related literatures; shed light on the impact of typology on the spiritual aspirations of female believers in the Middle Ages; make a corpus of previously unedited texts available for scrutiny.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/E003648/1","grantId":"AH/E003648/1","fundValue":"22698","fundStart":"2007-05-01","fundEnd":"2007-08-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Andrew Martin Beresford","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Durham University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
