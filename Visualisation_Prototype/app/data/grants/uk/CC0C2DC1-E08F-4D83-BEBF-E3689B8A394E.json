The existing datasets are newly generated by two area-leading international consortia in the 1000 Plant (1KP) transcriptome and 1000 Insect Transcriptome Evolution (1KITE) projects. Ongoing bioinformatics analyses are co-ordinate by the China National Genebank (CNGB). The newly available technology tool for pathogen screening is established in a previous NERC funded project to the PI in the Technology Proof of Concept programme. The new opportunity is based on the mutual benefits for conducting a pathogen screening study using the two large sequencing datasets and the new bioinformatics pipeline. The objective is to set up an International Plant and Insect Pathogen Database (IPIPSD) that can archive, sort and represent pathogen sequences from datasets generated by the Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology. The 1KP and 1KITE projects were designed to make gene and gene function discoveries in non-model species living in a wide variety of environmental/ecological niches. The shoot gun NGS sequencing strategy non-discriminately produced sequences derived from plants/insects as well as from pathogens naturally infected them. We propose to search, harvest, annotate and sort pathogen sequences from the 1KP and 1KITE libraries. IPIPSD will be largely composed of non-model species thus is unique to the other existing databases. The database will be published in peer reviewed scientific journals and made freely accessible to the public via the World Wide Web. To publicise IPIPSD and to promote the pathogen screening technology, an International Workshop of Pathogen Screening is proposed in the 9th International Conference of Genomics in November 2014. Once set up, IPIPSD will facilitate pathogen screening in environmental samples, providing a much needed knowledge advance for supporting environmental/ecological studies. Furthermore, IPIPSD will serve as a platform for large long term international collaborations, e.g., the Genome 10000 (Genome 10K) and 5000 Insect and Arthropod Genome Sequencing Initiative (i5K) which are also hosted in CNGB.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/L012863/1","grantId":"NE/L012863/1","fundValue":"34329","fundStart":"2014-04-01","fundEnd":"2015-05-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  Nil.
