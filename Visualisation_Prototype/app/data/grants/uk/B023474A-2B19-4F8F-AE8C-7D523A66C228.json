Proteomics is the systematic study of the expression, functions and interactions of proteins.\n \nThe key techniques used in proteomics are mass spectrometry (MS) and liquid chromatography and are performed on instruments called Mass Spectrometers; and High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) systems. In combination, these two instruments are designed to separate and identify proteins, fragments of proteins (peptides) and modified proteins obtained from cells, tissues and biofluids. They allow us to compare the amounts of proteins between different conditions (e.g., comparison of protein levels between normal cells and cancer cells), and to identify proteins important within a specific biological process including normal ones and those important in human diseases. This application will support the purchase of an advanced Mass Spectrometer and HPLC system with an enhanced ability to measure the amounts of these proteins and peptides at very low levels and with high accuracy.\n\nThe instrumentation has been requested by the Southern 4 Proteomic Consortium and will form part of a Proteomics hub in the South of England that will allow several universities to use this state-of-the-art instrumentation. This consortium also provides a forum to exchange proteomic expertise and knowledge; and to train researchers in the latest proteomic techniques. Housed within the Centre for Proteomic Research at the University of Southampton, the increased capacity and advanced capabilities of this instrumentation will permit a wide range of proteomic studies within areas of strategic importance, including those within many BBSRC priority areas including healthy aging across the lifecourse; bioenergy, generating new replacement fuels for a greener, sustainable future; food, nutrition and health; sustainability enhancing agricultural production; systems approaches to the biosciences; synthetic biology and data-driven biology.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/M012387/1","grantId":"BB/M012387/1","fundValue":"448654","fundStart":"2015-01-30","fundEnd":"2016-01-29","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Christopher Gregory Proud","coPersons":["Thomas  Bibby","Geoff  Kneale","Robert Michael  Ewing","Rainer Karl Cramer","Paul  Skipp","Matthew  Terry","J.
