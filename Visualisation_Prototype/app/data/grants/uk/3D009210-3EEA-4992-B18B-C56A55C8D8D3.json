The state has drawn upon, sustained and developed a form of knowledge, a network of knowers, and a preferred approach to knowing, in order to bring about change in the public domain. Attention will be given to the primacy of school leadership as (a) a form of knowledge designed to deliver improvement and effectiveness; (b) underpinned by a network of knowers; and (c) ways of knowing as required attributes and behaviours structured by national standards. There is evidence from literature searches and the ESRC seminar series, Challenging the Orthodoxy of School Leadership, that there are other types of knowledge, knowing and knowers within the field in England. The Project will collect the professional biographies of a sample of those involved: experts in research in the UK and internationally, practitioners in schools, chief executives and officers in local government and national agencies. The outcome of the Project will be: (a) a scholarly account of the scope, orientation and development of the field; and, (b) a theory of knowledge production that will describe and explain the inter-relationship between the state, research and practice.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-23-1192","grantId":"RES-000-23-1192","fundValue":"105794","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2007-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Helen  Gunter","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
