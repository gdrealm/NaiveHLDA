Advanced cancer usually contains cells that are highly abnormal compared with normal cells in the tissue where the cancer is developing. These cancer cells have the capacity to adapt to different environments and to change their genetic material, which contributes to the development of resistance to anti-cancer treatments. At the initial stages of cancer formation, however, cancer cells are physiologically more normal, carry fewer genetic changes and are easier to target and eliminate. Research aiming to develop new tools for early cancer detection as well as to target cancer cells at the initial stages of tumour formation are needed to boost survival rates and to minimise the damaging effects of both advanced cancer and the intensive treatments required to eradicate it. \n\nTo achieve this goal, we need to investigate the initial stages of cancer development, which are difficult to detect in humans, as they mostly go unnoticed. However, animal models, and in particular mice have proven to be excellent tools to understand the origins of cancer. Research from several groups has established a concept, referred to as the 'cancer stem cell paradigm', whereby tissue-specific stem cells are the origins of several tumours and cancers in mice and humans. This model proposes that when normal stem cells become mutated (i.e. the DNA changes in comparison with a normal stem cell), they give rise to cancer stem cells, which can proliferate and give rise to daughter cells that form the tumour. Essentially, cancer stem cells are the cell-of-origin of the tumours, with important implications for cancer treatment. For example, cancer stem cells are often resistant to therapies and although present in very low numbers, they can cause regrowth of the tumour if they are not destroyed. Cancer therapies should therefore aim to target the tumour mass as well as the cancer stem cells.\n\nWe have recently generated mouse models for a type of human tumour called adamantinomatous craniopharyngioma (ACP). This is an aggressive tumour that develops in the pituitary gland, an essential organ located under the brain that controls critical physiological functions such as growth, reproduction and metabolism. ACP is the most common pituitary tumour in children and young adults and the third most common brain tumour in children. ACP is associated with a poor quality of life of the patients due to compression or infiltration of the brain and can be fatal. Current treatments are surgery and/or radiotherapy, but these are not ideal and cause long-term side effects in the patients. Typical symptoms of ACP patients include obesity, diabetes mellitus type 2 and total failure of pituitary gland function.\n\nOur research has revealed that pituitary stem cells are central players in the generation of ACP. However, contrary to the cancer stem cell paradigm, when these stem cells are mutated they do not divide and give rise to the tumour, instead they send signals to the surrounding cells, which eventually start proliferating uncontrollably to produce a pituitary tumour. Therefore, mutated stem cells instruct nearby cells to generate a tumour, a novel model that is conceptually different to the cancer stem cell paradigm. In this proposal we aim to investigate the mechanisms underlying this novel role for stem cells in cancer. Our goal is to improve our knowledge on the initial steps of tumour formation using our mouse models. This will lead to better management of ACP patients, and will also have implications in other tumours and cancers in which stem cells may have tumour-inducing capacity.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/M000125/1","grantId":"MR/M000125/1","fundValue":"767006","fundStart":"2015-01-01","fundEnd":"2017-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Juan Pedro  Martinez-Barbera","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
