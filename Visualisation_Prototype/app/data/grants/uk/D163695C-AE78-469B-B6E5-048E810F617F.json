During brain development a large number of neurons (about 10 billion) make an astonishingly large number of synaptic connections (about 100 trillion) to form a brain. Not surprisingly, an important question in neuroscience is to understand how synapses are formed and how these connections pass information from one neuron to the next. At the synapse, the transfer of information is carried out by the release of packets of neurotransmitter released from a presynaptic neuron onto specific receptors on a postsynaptic neuron. Neurotransmitter is stored inside membrane vesicles and is released by the fusion of vesicles with the plasma membrane, which expels the neurotransmitter towards the postsynaptic neuron. The membrane from the vesicle is subsequently retrieved from the plasma membrane to be refilled with neurotransmitter and recycled for use once again. The research proposed here will focus on understanding how a presynaptic terminal forms and matures to provide such an exquisitely controlled system for releasing neurotransmitter. For this purpose I will use especially designed fluorescent probes that report vesicle cycling in real time by showing flashes of fluorescence every time a vesicle fuses with the plasma membrane or by tagging the vesicle with coloured particles that make them visible under a fluorescent microscope. Exploiting these tools I will study how synapses gradually mature to release neurotransmitter, from the initial moments of the formation of a synaptic contact to the final stages of neuronal maturation. Understanding these events will help uncover how connections in the brain form during development and help us understand neurological diseases where this process has gone wrong.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0901307","grantId":"G0901307","fundValue":"491088","fundStart":"2010-06-14","fundEnd":"2013-06-13","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Juan  Burrone","coPersons":[],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
