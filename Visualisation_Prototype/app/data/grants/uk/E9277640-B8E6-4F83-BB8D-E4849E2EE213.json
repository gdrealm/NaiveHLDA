{"id":"E9277640-B8E6-4F83-BB8D-E4849E2EE213","title":"Arterial Revascularization Trial (ART)","abstractText":"Around 25,000 coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) operations are performed annually in the UK. Most patients need three bypass grafts and the standard CABG uses a single internal mammary artery (single IMA) from either side of the breastbone and supplemental vein grafts from the leg or a radial artery from the arm as necessary. This gives good results in the short-term but over ten years failure of vein grafts is higher than failure of the arteries. This can lead to reduced survival, recurrent angina and the need for further treatment including the possibility of a second operation. There is some evidence that using both arteries on either side of the breastbone (bilateral IMA grafts) may improve survival and reduce the need for redo surgery. However this operation takes longer to do and slightly increases the chance that the breastbone will not heal. To try and determine which is the better operation we propose to randomize (ie as if by the toss of a coin) patients to single or bilateral IMA grafts, along with other vein or artery as necessary. We will then follow up patients annually for at least 10 years after their operation.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0200390","grantId":"G0200390","fundValue":"2204590","fundStart":"2004-07-01","fundEnd":"2009-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"David P Taggart","coPersons":["Marcus  Flather","Alastair McIntosh Gray","Douglas Graham Altman","Keith  Channon"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
