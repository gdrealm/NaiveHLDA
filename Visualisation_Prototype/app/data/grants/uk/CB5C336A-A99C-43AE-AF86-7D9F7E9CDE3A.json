{"id":"CB5C336A-A99C-43AE-AF86-7D9F7E9CDE3A","title":"Grid integration of multiple energy-storage flywheels","abstractText":"The focus of this competition is on integration of energy storage technologies into the energy system, and not on\ndeveloping the underlying technologies. The industrial partner Williams Grand Prix Engineering have already developed the\nunderlying technology behind the flywheel, and have a fully working product. The project is therefore aims to look at how\nmultiple flywheel units can be best integrated into the grid. This will include developing a control strategy for a multiple\nflywheel system in order to optimise efficiency, and life. Optimal arrangements of grid tie inverters (size and quantity) in\nterms of efficiency and cost, will also be investigated for a wide range of power requirements, to further improve the\ncomplete energy-storage package.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/L505900/1","grantId":"EP/L505900/1","fundValue":"12150","fundStart":"2014-02-01","fundEnd":"2015-01-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Kais  Atallah","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
