This involves a focus on industry supply-chain relationships, and also an emphasis on relationships between businesses and a range of stakeholders including consumers, employees, investors, regulators and communities.\n\nMany of the Centre's projects are based in its three key industries of food, electronics and automotive. It is also developing new research streams in other industries including financial and professional services, waste management, construction and health.\n\nBRASS's work aims to produce:\n\n- New knowledge and understanding about the significant changes occurring in the relationships amongst businesses and their stakeholders, relating to their environmental and social impacts;\n\n- Partnerships with commercial and public sector organisations to both conduct research and implement changes based on our research findings and expertise;\n\n- Communications initiatives and educational contributions which will inform and promote the debate about business sustainability and corporate social responsibility","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=not_applicable","grantId":"not_applicable","fundValue":"6331320","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2013-01-15","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  In addition to academic publications, BRASS's research work has contributed strongly to the evidence base of both the public and private sector through a mixture of:\n\nCommissioned research: including research into the environmental impacts of household consumption (Defra), biosecurity (Defra and Welsh Government), promoting sustainable consumption (NESTA), social enterprise and sustainability (DTI/BIS), nanotech (Defra), human rights and CSR (Ministry of Justice), environmental impacts of business and trade (UN). It also undertook commissioned research for commercial companies including Toyota, Volvo, Apple, Triodos Bank and Fujitsu. \n\nData resources: BRASS developed and managed the Industrial Waste Arisings Database on behalf of the Environment Agency and provided statistics from and analysis of it for a range of users. It also developed a large online library of resources relating to the 2001/2002 Foot &amp;amp; Mouth outbreak which was later passed onto to another organisation to manage;\n\nPolicy briefs and briefing events: BRASS developed a range of policy briefing papers on topics including recycling, provided policy briefing directly to policy and practice organisations such as to Defra and the Welsh Government on topics such as biosecurity and hazardous waste; to the Lord Chancellor's Dept on markets and regulation; or to the EU on the precautionary principle or the European Patent Office on responsible innovation, and either hosted or contributed to a range of briefing events on topics including biosecurity, ecological footprinting, food supply chains, sustainable school meals and sustainable automobility;\n\nExpert evidence submissions and comment; BRASS researchers have regularly provided evidence for a range of policy and practice organisations including UK and Welsh Government (biosecurity, planning and energy infrastructure, climate change, sustainable living, and contaminated land); EU (automotive sustainability, energy infrastructure, biopatenting, sustainable marketing); OECD (automotive sustainability); UN (environmental regulation, sustainable food, species conservation). BRASS also provided very direct support in terms of the drafting of regulation particularly to branches of government for Northern Ireland &amp;amp; Wales;\n\nEngagement via a range of policy and practice networks and partnership projects with organisations including the ACCA, UKELA, the Law Society, and Groundwork;\n\nThe development and promotion of new tools to help practitioners, policy makers: this included developing an environmental ratings system for vehicles (with Clifford-Thomas); demonstrating that ecological footprinting could be used as a management tool for events, sports venues and even school meals; the development of a research-based report and interactive toolkit to help SMEs to adopt CSR initiatives; creating a system for analysing the sustainability impacts of sports events developed for UKSport; a simple online interactive 'sustainable community' model to act as an interface to the Centre's sustainable communities research work along with community guidance resources; an online environmental law resource developed with UKELA to provide citizens and small businesses access to information on environmental justice; the CSR, poverty and vulnerability work in Latin America and Europe that produced a new methodology for determining and mapping how the environmental risks generated by business activities combined with patterns of social deprivation to create 'hotspots' of risk.\n\nThere are a number of research topic specific impacts linked to the research findings that are mentioned in the 'Key Findings' section, but a few of the other key research related impacts are as follows: \n\nCSR &amp; Extractive Industries: BRASS had a longstanding interest in CSR for mining and extractive industries which was promoted through a major stakeholder engagement event in London. It involved 50 participants included mining MNCs (De Beer, Xstrata, AngloGold), consultants, key NGOs and supranational organizations (World Bank, EBRD). This event used innovative stakeholder engagement techniques (role playing, framing) to explore and develop a research agenda addressing future challenges and conflicts for extractive industries. Published outputs included journal articles on mine safety and natural resource law.\n\nBiopatenting and Biosecurity: BRASS research work on biopatenting had a particular impact in Germany where a major report on biopatenting in agriculture was submitted to the German State Secretary of Agriculture in July 2010. This report went from the German Agriculture Minister to the President of the European Patent Office (EPO) as part of an amicus curiae letter with regard to a pending key decision of the Board of the EPO, widely known as the &quot;Broccoli Case&quot;. This led to a meeting in late September between the President of the EPO and the German Minister which was largely based around the report and its recommendations. The subsequent final decision in December 2010 by the EPO Board to not allow the patenting of plants developed by conventional breeding techniques, completely reversed the decision from two years earlier.\n\nEnvironmental Regulation and Justice. BRASS had a range of environmental law-related projects, many with direct economic and social impacts. In June 09 Lord Justice Carnwath launched the new website &quot;Law and Your Environment&quot; developed by BRASS as part of a joint project with UK Environmental Law Association. This provides a 'one-stop' solution for citizens, firms and Third Sector Organisations (such as NGOs or community groups) needing plain English legal information on environmental issues such as planning applications, pollution incidents through to tackling climate change. It promotes greater environmental justice by providing both citizens and organisations with details of their rights and responsibilities along with sources of further information. BRASS was also commissioned by the Environmental Law Foundation (ELF) in London to conduct an analysis on the funding of potential environmental legal actions. This analysis was presented in an ELF report launched at the House of Lords by Lord Woolf. This work had a strong media profile also led to a book chapter and two conference papers on access to environmental justice.\n\nNanotechnology. BRASS led a stream of pioneering nanotech-related social science research in terms of industry regulation and practical CSR strategies. It produced two major reports for Defra and the DTI and findings were also presented to the Nanotechnology Stakeholder Forum (main liaison body between government and industry led by BIS) and Nanotechnology Issues Dialogue Group (Inter-departmental government group). BRASS was also featured in a special issue of Modern Government on Nanotech, and a policy brief on nanotech in food was presented to the House of Lords Select Committee on Science &amp; Technology. BRASS also developed a PAS industrial standard for the BSI (137 - safe handling and use of nano materials) as a piece of action research, co-organised a Nanotechnology and CSR event in 2009 and contributed to a Responsible Nanoforum/Food &amp; Drink Federation nano &amp; food stakeholder roundtable in 2010. BRASS Nanotech methodologies were also adopted by other research studies and reports including the &quot;Review of health safety aspects of nanotechnologies in food production&quot; (RIKILT &amp; RIVM, Holland) and &quot;International Approaches to the Regulatory Governance of Nanotechnology&quot; (Canada).The impact and value of BRASS's Nanotech regulatory work is explicitly highlighted in the Government's Nanotechnology Strategy.

This makes its key findings hard to summarize, but some highlights were as follows: \n\nBioregions work: BRASS work on agri-food and rural-regional development led to new work that conceptually explored the boundaries and distinctions between the more localised eco-economy and bio-economy models of spatial development. Initial work based on our study areas of Devon and Shetland were disseminated internationally in Europe and North America to combined academics/policy audiences, and captured in journal papers for Cambridge Journal of Regions, Economy and Society, and Town Planning Review. This led to an exploration of how effective new re-localised hubs, clusters and networks of an eco-economy can be created as part of new sustainable infrastructures in towns and cities, and in rural locations. In the Toronto city region this led to a collaboration with Canadian partners on two engagement projects (funded by the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture and the Social and Humanities Research Council for Canada respectively) on new 'roadmaps' and pilots of best practice in building new local and regional food hubs. \n\nClimate attitudes and behaviours: BRASS has taken a leading role in climate research combining environmental psychology with a consumer behaviour perspective, applied to key sectors including food, transport and energy. The outputs from this work included two Earthscan books on climate change, engagement and behaviour; a paper on public understandings of 'carbon' and its role in generating an environmental value-action gap in relation to adoption of low-carbon lifestyles for Global Environmental Change; a paper on environmental self-identity and its influence on carbon offsetting behaviours for Journal of Environmental Psychology; one on climate beliefs and energy choices for Energy and Environment; and a leading role in a Wiley Interdisciplinary Review on Climate Change. This work also formed the basis of a private briefing to Chris Huhne (then Climate Change Minister) and officials at DECC in August 2010. A paper published in Journal of Marketing Management on consumer response to climate change based on a 1600+ adult sample, demonstrated a modest but significant element of perceived 'consumer social responsibility' in relation to climate change. This represents an important revision to the widely accepted notion that companies rather than consumers have responsibilities in terms of the consequences of market transactions and externalities. Other work on climate change narratives represents a groundbreaking approach to exploring how specific types of consumers and citizens understand and respond to particular climate change 'framings'.\n\nCSR, Poverty &amp;amp; Vulnerability. BRASS led a multidisciplinary international collaboration aiming to improve well-being through business interventions in urban areas which combine high environmental deterioration and social vulnerability (so-called 'hot-spots'). This research developed an interdisciplinary framework combining theories on risk, vulnerability/adaptability, sustainability, systems-thinking and CSR/entrepreneurship which was further distilled into an intervention model to reduce poverty and risk through stakeholders' engagement. A key methodological development was the design of a spatial analysis tool to identify areas in need of urgent intervention (based on indicators of social vulnerability and accumulated potential environmental hazards generated by industrial activity). Policy findings include the geographical identification of 1236 census units under high risk in three Ibero-American countries and case-studies of good business practice emphasising CSR adaptation to local contexts through partnerships. The project generated 2 book chapters and 3 papers for leading journals (including Journal of Business Ethics and Journal of Environmental Management) and a book, and the findings were fed into policy-making through events in Spain and Buenos Aires.\n\nProject 'Bernie': For over two years BRASS worked with South Wales Fire &amp;amp; Rescue on a social marketing project developing a behavioural intervention to deter rural fire-setting in South Wales Valleys' communities. In terms of scientific impact this was both an innovative application of social marketing, and a global first in rigorously applying the National Social Marketing Centre's 'Total Planning Process'. An intervention was devised and tested during Spring 2010, with BRASS involved in the formative research, project management, Fire Service staff training and evaluation. The project led to a reduction in fires during the 6 week intervention period (compared to a 'control' community) of 46%, three times the original target. Follow up stakeholder interviews showed improvements in working practices within SWFRS, improved community cohesion and a significant shift in social norms about fires. Police data showed that reported incidence of all anti-social behaviour reduced in the community during the Bernie intervention, and that fire incidents continued to be reduced afterwards. It generated new insights into the role of social marketing in delivering public sector services and influencing inter and intra-organisational working practices.\n\nTowards sustainable food: BRASS produced a range of academic outputs linked to its Towards Sustainable Food Research, many of which were also highlighted in the BRASS book: 'The New Regulation and Governance of Food: Beyond the Food Crisis?' (Routledge) addressing major questions about power, governance and security in the global production and consumption of food (now in a paperback edition and published in the USA). There was also a range of socio-economic ccontributions for this work. This included BRASS leading the research work for a report on global food security published by Chatham House; BRASS providing the Research work for the Welsh Government and Food and Drink Advisory Partnership's new 10 Year Food and Drink Strategy for Wales; work on more sustainable school meals including work on ecofootprinting for school meals to combine with nutritional data to create an overall sustainability perspective on the subject and the work led by Kevin Morgan (which was recently recognised with an ESRC Impact Champion award); and work assessing the sustainability of particular food initiatives including the Food for Life programme.\n\nTowards sustainable automobility: BRASS undertook a long-term stream of work aiming to redefine what a sustainable automotive industry might look like. This was developed through the BRASS authored reports published by TrendTracker on 'Car Futures: Rethinking the Automotive Industry - Beyond the American Model' and by AutomotiveWorld on 'Low-Carbon Cars: Strategic Implications for the Vehicle Manufacturers'. The Micro-Factory Retailing concepts for car production pioneered by BRASS Researchers were taken into practical production by several firms (Gordon Murray Design, Axon Automotive and RiverSimple), demonstrating that BRASS research has shaped both thinking and practice relating to the automotive industry and sustainability. From a consumption perspective BRASS articles on promoting more sustainable mobility behaviours were published in Ecological Economics; Environmental Policy &amp;amp; Governance and Journal of Environmental Planning &amp;amp; Management. Other contributions included articles and book chapters on 'new technologies for cleaner cars'; a 'state of the art' review of fuel cell technologies; and a review of America's hydrogen strategy; and a series of webinars and technical articles on automotive technologies (such as fuel cells and hydrogen power) and policies (including the UK car scrappage scheme, industry restructuring and European carbon reduction targets). \n\n\n'Green Growth'. A major area of work for BRASS in its later years was on 'Green Growth' including (a) the analysis of green growth policies (in East Asia, Europe and Brazil) to stimulate innovation and transform productive processes; (b) the analysis of UK industrial performance in terms of synergies between environmental innovations (e.g. in waste treatment) and economic performance; and (c) market approaches to biodiversity and natural resources conservation (e.g ecosystem services for poverty alleviation). This work was encapsulated in a book published by Springer on Green-Growth: Managing the Transition to Sustainable Capitalism (Learning by doing in East-Asia and Europe). It also journal articles for the International Journal of Operations and Production Management and Journal of the Operational Research Society; to a piece written for the UN Research Institute for Social Development on 'Green Growth, Social Agency and the Regulation of Agricultural Production in India and Brazil'; and was the basis of a Westminster ministerial briefing and a presentation to the Parliamentary Social Science Group. \n\n'Researching Sustainability'. In August 2011 Earthscan published the book 'Researching Sustainability: A Guide to Social Science Methods, Practice and Engagement', written entirely by BRASS researchers with its 18 chapters based on research methodologies, challenges and user engagement opportunities informed by experience from BRASS research projects across the first ten years of the Centre's existence. It represents a ground-breaking contribution to social science for sustainability and brings together contributions from a range of social science disciplines, including geography, planning, sociology, law, business and economics.\n\nSingle Use Carrier Bag Research. A single use carrier bag charge was introduced in Wales in October 2011 (as a possible precursor to a similar UK measure) providing BRASS the chance to conduct some pathfinder research on this policy development. A team of BRASS researchers conducted a survey with members of the public and retailers on the introduction of the new charge. The research produced an analysis of the attitudes, awareness and acceptance of the charge by the public and an analysis of the attitudes of retail companies, their level of understanding of the regulations and WG guidance, how they have introduced the charge (including staff training and record keeping) and how they will disseminate the proceeds from the charge. This work has generated widespread media and policy interest with a policy paper on its implications developed for the Scottish Government. The results were also fed back to the Welsh Government in two reports and the research is now being used to generate academic publications.\n\nWellbeing and the Young. As part of a national debate about 'wellbeing' BRASS was commissioned by the ONS to research (in partnership with Techniquest) into young people's perceptions of well-being. The results were presented to a largely policy-maker audience in June 2011 at the National Museum of Wales as part of Wales Sustainability Week. The findings from the report were mentioned in several key documents published in July 2011 at the six-month stage of the national 'What matters to you?' debate launched by the Prime Minister in November 2010 and formed the basis of two published papers.\n\nWork-Life Integration. BRASS for several years took a leading role in co-ordinating an international network of researchers interested in the emerging topic of 'Work-Life Integration' (as part of BRASS's Work, Wellbeing and Welfare research stream). In January 2010 a new book 'Ways of Living: Work, Community and Lifestyle Choice' was published, by Palgrave Macmillan with BRASS providing the Lead Editor and two chapters. This book is a key tangible output from an International Work-Life Integration Colloquium held in Melbourne and co-sponsored by BRASS. It provides a step-change in thinking on work-life integration with a focus on two vital, but neglected, areas (a) the importance of locating work-life discussions within a far wider range of influencing variables than in the past, and (b) by paying greater attention to previously overlooked groups, including low paid workers in insecure economic and social environments. This latter issue has been pursued further in subsequent research, publications and conference presentations.\n\nSustainable Communities. In 2008 BRASS published Sustainable Communities: New Spaces for Planning, Participation and Engagement a book which represented a synthesis of research work conducted by BRASS researchers over several years. It combines key debates and empirical cases from an international perspective exploring the ways in which more sustainable and resilient communities can be built. BRASS also completed the major project Motivating, Engaging, Leading and Supporting Skills and Knowledge for Sustainable Communities - Applying Models of Sustainable Localised Economies. This brought together case study analysis of the skills and knowledge behind the success of twelve different sustainable communities initiatives. This was complemented by an in-depth study of initiatives within the community of Stroud and all of the project findings were pulled together to create an interactive 'virtual sustainable community'. This virtual community, made publicly available on the project website, has been designed as an innovative way of engaging with a much wider audience in the dissemination of research findings and it links to the project case study communities to provide examples of skills and knowledge development for sustainable communities. The project findings have been distilled into a non-technical 'Guidance for Communities'; generated six academic articles, two book chapters and have fed into policy-making through briefings for Defra and CLG.\n\nThird Sector/Social Enterprise; BRASS undertook work looking at the role of social enterprises and other Third Sector organizations in the development of more sustainable local economies. This included the publication of the ESRC Research Monograph 'Social Enterprises: Diversity and Dynamics, Contexts and Contributions' launched at the 2008 Social Enterprise Research Conference. The monograph integrates findings from a wide range of studies on social enterprise and analyses the needs for future research. The research challenges facing Social Enterprise were further expanded in the discussion paper, 'Social Enterprise: The Research Challenge' and the article, 'Eight Paradoxes of the Social Enterprise Research Agenda', published in the Social Enterprise Journal. This work was complemented by another research monograph entitled 'Strategic Positioning in Voluntary and Charitable Organizations' published by Routledge. This book continues a recurring theme in BRASS's work of the transfer of management ideas between commercial and non-commercial sectors by examining the adoption of generic commercial (for-profit) management strategies and approaches in the non-profit context. This research also generated a book chapter and three papers in leading management journals on management strategies within the Third Sector, including one in Public Management Review on strategic positioning within social enterprises. BRASS's Research findings will be useful for any researchers seeking to take forward issues relating to business sustainability and corporate social responsibility (CSR) particularly in the following key areas for BRASS Research: \n\n1. Towards Sustainable Mobility: this included work on alternative vehicle technologies, and alternative vehicle consumption and production including electric vehicles; alternative business models and production methods, particularly Micro-Factory Retailing; alternative consumption methods such as car sharing; behavioural issues including transport choices and 'eco-driving'; and projects based on policy and infrastructure to promote alternative approaches to mobility\n\n2.

Behaviour Change and Social Marketing: including work on social marketing for sustainable behaviours, consumption reduction and sustainable communities; consumer perceptions and behaviour in relation to domestic energy and &quot;Smart Homes&quot;; and behavioural impacts of the carrier bag charge introduced in Wales (covering both consumer and retailer responses). \n\n8. Sustainable Business Models and Practices: including work relating to alternative vehicle businesses and alternative food businesses; studies of social enterprise; FairTrade consumption and production systems; notions of distributed economies; and broader theoretical work on alternative business models for sustainability. \n\n9. CSR &amp;amp; Accountability in Key Contexts: including projects relating to CSR in the contexts of SMEs, Premiership football clubs, financial services organisations, the mining industry, and in Arts businesses; also projects concerning corporate criminality (including corporate killing) and irresponsible accounting; CSR in industry supply chains; and there was also some broader work on the links between CSR, sustainability, corporate strategies and leadership.\n\n10. Climate Change and Carbon Reduction: including work on climate scepticism; notions of consumer social responsibility for climate change; investigating 'climate change narratives'; energy governance; 'Smart-Grids'' and climate orientated aspects of the food and automotive streams.\n\nFour elements of the BRASS research agenda are continuing within Cardiff University under the auspices of its Sustainable Places Research Institute: \n\nSustainable food and agriculture systems research. Building on the work that BRASS has done on sustainable food and food governance, which has strong PLACE-based themes relating to rural economies, agricultural communities and the theme of food within sustainable city regions;\n\nSustainable mobility. Building on BRASS work linked to sustainability within the automotive industry and the promotion of more sustainable transport and travel behaviours. This has strong links to the PLACE research theme on mobilities, flows and migrations and a strong element of shared work between BRASS and PLACE on this agenda emerged during 2011/12;\n\nEcosystem services valuation. This will extend BRASS work on issues like eco-footprinting, valuing biodiversity and sustainability impacts of tourism, and increasingly will connect with the physical sciences contributions to PLACE on issues such as biodiversity to tackle a research agenda linked to natural resources and physical 'places' that is an increasing priority for policy makers nationally and internationally;\n\nSustainability communities. Including work on the contribution of social innovation, arts and the creative industries; green space and land ownership and elements of food production and consumption and mobility systems to urban and rural community sustainability and well-being.
