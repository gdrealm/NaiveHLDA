{"id":"5A49DEE2-9FF9-4309-A313-3B2F01A75FA2","title":"Living with war: the accommodation of warfare within eighteenth-century British culture","abstractText":"Historians have described the growth of the British 'fiscal-military state', a development which is accompanied by important transformations in urban and domestic life, by the rise of consumer spending, an expansion of the print market, and the development of a culture of politeness. The relationship between the massive increase in military commitment and these other cultural developments has been relatively neglected, except in some specialist studies which focus on the representation of particular military figures or institutions. My current project aims to address this neglect. Its starting point is a recognition that in the period of transformation between 1680 and 1730, programmes for the reform of morals and refinement of manners, the development of new forms of journalism and new forms of fiction, the emergence of ideas of aesthetic disinterestedness, often took place in the context of war (or of preparations for war), and often defined themselves implicitly or overtly in relation to the demands and rewards of war. My project focuses on the areas in which the interaction between the arts of war and peace seem particularly important, and in which some writers attempt to reconcile a growing public to the massive, and very expensive, increase in the national commitment to war. \\n\\nOne part of this project will therefore explore the process of reconciling readers to war. Here I am less concerned with formal justifications of war than with the ways in which moral responses to the violence and cost of war are related to, and deflected by, debates about manners, domesticity, gender identities, and ideas of cultural value. This part will draw together and reflect upon evidence from a range of sources, including reports of war in newspapers, first-person narratives of war experience (both historical and fictional), fast-day sermons and economic writings. It will take the form of an article, 'War and civil conduct in early eighteenth-century society', to be published in Eighteenth-Century Studies. \\n \\nWhile this exploration will help me to show how a recognition of the negative effects of war was accommodated and indirectly justified within various contemporary writings, I also want to consider a complementary tendency: the ways in which, in discussions of civil society, manners and conduct, war is presented not as a grim activity in which the rights and liberties enjoyed within civil society are suspended, but as an arena in which the ideals to which civil society aspires are most fully attained. Relatively little attention has been given to the fact that some of the writers who are most closely associated with the drive to develop a culture of politeness, including Addison, Steele and Shaftesbury, find their ideal of sociability realised in military life, in a model of communal relations and gentlemanly conduct divorced from domestic consumption and commercial competition. Some ethical sermons of the period also sometimes take their bearings from references to war. I want to examine these developments in relation to contemporary criticisms of traditional military heroism, the continuing hostility to the standing army, and the increasing evidence about the human and financial costs of war. This will take the form of an article, 'War and sociability in early eighteenth-century culture', to be published in Eighteenth-Century Life. \\n\\nThis research will consider how writers can work to promote acceptance of war even through implied criticism of it. And it will involve study of the production of a 'military dream of society' different from the one identified by Foucault (which emphasised 'permanent coercions', rather than the shaping of polite identity), and a model of sociability (formulated by Addison, Steele, Shaftesbury and others) different from that which recent scholarship has associated with the coffee house.\\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/H006834/1","grantId":"AH/H006834/1","fundValue":"23395","fundStart":"2010-01-01","fundEnd":"2010-03-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Andrew  Lincoln","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Queen Mary, University of London","findingsText":" My project shows that, in the reigns of William III and Queen Anne, war served the interests of those who wanted to regulate and refine the manners of civil society. \n\n\n\nI show how the revival of the theory of the sublime provided a form of justification for the violence of war and for the representation of that violence in writing and the arts.\n\n\n\nI show how Fast Day and Thanksgiving services encouraged an imaginative participation in the violence of war while at the same time attempting to promote peaceful acceptance of its horrors.\n\n\n\nI show that one function of Addison's and Steele's attempt to promote politeness in their ground-breaking periodicals, The Tatler and The Spectator, was to reconcile readers to a massive increase in military activity, by providing them with fictionalized alternatives to the unsettling realities of war represented in the newspapers.
