Whereas previous studies have used simplified models, idealised forcing, or limited domains, we will use a comprehensively initialised model of ice flow throughout Antarctica, including all mechanical processes that propagate thinning into the interior, to produce a highly-realistic simulation that can predict the response of the grounded ice sheet to the ice-shelf thinning observed by satellite. We will validate the simulations against further satellite observations, before using them with scenarios of ice-shelf melt, guided by ocean models, to produce a probabilistic forecast of the future sea-level contribution from Antarctica to 2100.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/L005212/1","grantId":"NE/L005212/1","fundValue":"350172","fundStart":"2014-04-01","fundEnd":"2019-03-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Robert  Arthern","coPersons":["Hamish  Pritchard","Richard Carl Hindmarsh"],"organisation":"NERC British Antarctic Survey","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
