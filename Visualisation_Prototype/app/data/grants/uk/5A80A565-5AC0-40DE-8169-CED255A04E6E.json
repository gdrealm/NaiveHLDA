The molecules of interest for a proof of concept demostrator are those associated with Type 2 diabetes. The point-of-care diagnostic will allow a member of the public to determine whether they are likely to develop Type 2 Diabetic within the next 5 years of life. The user would be able to do this at home, at a pharmacist or under the supevision of their doctor. \n\nThe key to the technology is the nanostructure and composition of a biosensing patch which can be produced in extremely large numbers at low cost by combining scale up techniques to make large sheets of the nanoscale material with extremely fast laser cutting processes which are able to cut channels which are only 10 micrometers wide.\n\nThe technology has the potential to be configured to measure panels of disease markers within a single blood spot sample, which has the potential to measure the severity of disease and determine how far the disease has progressed.\n\nThe high sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic will allow early diagnososis of disease, which will lead to improved patient outcomes.\n\nOther applications include environmental and food monitoring and anti-counterfeit.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/K001892/1","grantId":"ST/K001892/1","fundValue":"48736","fundStart":"2012-11-14","fundEnd":"2014-02-13","funder":"STFC","impactText":"  The outcomes of the research have been used as evidence to support a grant application into the STFC miniIPS programme to develop the point of care devices for early warning of the onset of type 2 diabetes.

Following a set of well defined protocols, the material is able to create a light signal, where the strength of the light is related to the likelihood of a person developing Type 2 diabetes. The technology could be applied in a clinical laboratory for screening patients blood samples or could be packaged into a new type of point of care diagnostic for self test or in primary care settings.\n\nThe technology could be developed for anti-counterfeiting of materials, road side drug tests and environmental monitoring.
