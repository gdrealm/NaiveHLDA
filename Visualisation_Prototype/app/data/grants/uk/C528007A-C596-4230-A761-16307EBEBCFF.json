{"id":"C528007A-C596-4230-A761-16307EBEBCFF","title":"Feasibility of Semi-Active Damping for Advanced Rowing Ergometry","abstractText":"Rowing ergometers are widely used to train and select athletes for rowing and sculling. However, these machines do not accurately replicate the feel and force actions experienced in a boat. In a sport where tenths of a second may separate Gold from Silver a greater emphasis will likely be placed on improved training techniques. We are motivated to develop a new ergometer that should be a closer step towards on-water rowing for both amateur and elite, disabled and able bodied rowers. In this project we aim to explore new ideas in ergometer design and to develop a test prototype for further research. The new ergometer will be based on our present designs for paraplegic rowing using functional electrical stimulation (FES). We have now demonstrated that paraplegics can compete in the British and World Indoor Rowing Championships using electrical activation of their paralysed legs to produce the rowing motion. We expect that the development of a better rowing ergometer will offer new prospects for elite rowers and expedite the further development of FES rowing on-water.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F006241/1","grantId":"EP/F006241/1","fundValue":"110224","fundStart":"2007-07-01","fundEnd":"2009-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Brian James Andrews","coPersons":["Chris  McLeod"],"organisation":"Oxford Brookes University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
