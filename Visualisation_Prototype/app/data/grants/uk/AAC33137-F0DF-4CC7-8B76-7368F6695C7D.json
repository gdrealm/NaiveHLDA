State-of-the-art in-house development underpin the cutting-edge astrophysics research at the University of Manchester. The support requested is to develop this technology and then to exploit it to understand a range of phenomena from nearby pulsars (opening up new insights on Einstein's theory General Relativity) to the Cosmic Microwave Background (which reveals the conditions in the earliest stages after the Big Bang origin of the Universe).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=PP/D001056/1","grantId":"PP/D001056/1","fundValue":"3450530","fundStart":"2006-04-01","fundEnd":"2009-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Philip  Diamond","coPersons":["Myfanwy  Lloyd","Thomas William Muxlow","John Patrick Leahy","Shude  Mao","Gary  Fuller","Alan  Pedlar","Ralph  Spencer","Richard  Davis","Timothy John O'Brien","Raymond James Cohen","Michael  Kramer","Bryan  Anderson","Albert Auke Zijlstra","Ian  Browne","ALTHEA  WILKINSON","Peter Norman Wilkinson","Duncan  Lorimer","Neal  Jackson","Richard Antony Battye"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
