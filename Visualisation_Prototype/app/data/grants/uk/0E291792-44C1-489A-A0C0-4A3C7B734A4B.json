The ATSR instrument series was designed in the UK, and offers a significant advance on previous instruments in accuracy. A major problem in using satellite data accurately is that we must look through an often hazy atmosphere. The research will use the innovative design of the instrument method to to estimate with high accuracy the underlying surface reflectance. An independent estimate of atmospheric aerosol is also provided. The data will be processed to give a global estimate of light absorbed by vegetation, they key driver for photosynthesis and a major part of the global carbon cycle. The new dataset will facilitate other researchers in the fields of climate science and land cover change, allowing full explotation of Uk investment through NERC and the European Space Agency (ESA).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/F000111/1","grantId":"NE/F000111/1","fundValue":"81435","fundStart":"2008-03-01","fundEnd":"2010-04-30","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  This research aimed to develop and test a new method for satellite retrieval of aerosol optical depth and land surface reflectance.

The techniques are applicable to allow more accurate measurements of these, relevant to climate and weather forecast, and health. The results have influenced further operational generation of satellite datasets.
