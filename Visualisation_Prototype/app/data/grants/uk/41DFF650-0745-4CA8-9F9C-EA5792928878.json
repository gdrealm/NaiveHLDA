{"id":"41DFF650-0745-4CA8-9F9C-EA5792928878","title":"Transfer of Physics Methodology to the modelling of heat shock proteins and microtubules","abstractText":"The proposal involves the knowledge transfer between a group of applied mathematicians (the applicants) and a group of biologists in Durham. This transfer will involve working together on mathematical modeling of processes in biology (in particular the dynamics of microtubules and heat shock proteins). We will organise various seminars, inviting also speakers from outside Durham and, by working together we will transfer knowledge of physics methodology (which have used in our previous research) to biologists and, at the same time, learn from them. The outcome will not only be the transfer of knowledge but also important research performed in the area of modeling the dynamics of microtubules and heat shock proteins.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/H003649/1","grantId":"ST/H003649/1","fundValue":"113596","fundStart":"2010-01-16","fundEnd":"2010-10-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Wojciech Jerzy Maria  Zakrzewski","coPersons":["Anne  Taormina","Bernard Marie Andre Ghislain  Piette"],"organisation":"Durham University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
