KMOS will allow Infra-red spectra to be taken of up to 24 stars and external galaxies simultaneously. Oxford is building the three identical spectrographs of the KMOS instrument. Each of the spectrographs must operate at very low temperatures to reduce instrument background, We will be designing specialised optics and mechanisms as part of the spectrograph to allow operation at low temperature and at wavelengths between 0.9microns and 2.5 microns well to the red of the optical spectrum.
