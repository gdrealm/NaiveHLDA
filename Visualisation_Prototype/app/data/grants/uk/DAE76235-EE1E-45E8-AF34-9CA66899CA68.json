{"id":"DAE76235-EE1E-45E8-AF34-9CA66899CA68","title":"Using bibliometic data in the effective allocation of research funding","abstractText":"<p>It is important to investigate the effective allocation of research funding to ensure value for money. Even a small increase in value for money could result in huge savings; in 2009, Higher Education Funding Council for England spent &pound;1.5 billion on quality-related research funding. It is also timely and important that if bibliometric data are to be introduced in the Research Excellence Framework, they are effectively deployed.</p>\n\n<p>The primary aim of this project is to obtain findings on how bibliometrics data could be used more effectively in the allocation of research funding.&nbsp; In the proposal it was suggested that this primary aim would be achieved by investigating weaknesses in citation analyses. However, this approach was found to be too narrow and so his primary goal addressed by conducting a series of policy relevant investigations on the allocation of research funding (described in the non-technical summary).</p>\n\n<p>The methodology used is citation analysis. ‘Citation’ can be defined in terms of ‘reference’; Article A receives a citation from Article B, if, and only if, Article B refers to Article A. A fundamental tenet of citation analysis is that generally the number of citations is a good indicator of quality.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/I028633/1","grantId":"ES/I028633/1","fundValue":"77158","fundStart":"2011-02-01","fundEnd":"2013-01-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Jonathan M  Levitt","coPersons":["Michael Arijan Thelwall"],"organisation":"Loughborough University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
