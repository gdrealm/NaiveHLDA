{"id":"84A7620C-5C8D-4AB8-840F-39CF2ABE42D3","title":"Diaspora Artists","abstractText":"Diaspora Artists is a project developed between Eddie Chalmers (a Bristol-based curator and writer) and Watershed in partnership with the Faculty of Creative Arts, UWE to enable the online digitalisation of a relevant visual arts archive. The aim of the project is to develop a leading and unique Bristol-based visual arts Research and Reference Facility, with a dedicated focus on the multiple disaporas from which so many artists have emerged â€“ offering support to these artists and facilitating greater exposure of their work, by developing accessibility of the work to online audiences. The project is a unique opportunity to preserve and make available to online audiences material of historical and cultural significance, making a powerful contribution to the online presence of UK based Disaporic Arts practices and in so doing promote dialogue about the nature of cultural history. The project is also a testing ground for cross-sector research into visual arts and digital technologies, and particularly online archiving, searchability and audience accessibility and forms a potential research model for future online visual arts archives and ways of developing and engaging audiences online.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/G500118/1","grantId":"AH/G500118/1","fundValue":"25165","fundStart":"2008-12-01","fundEnd":"2009-11-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Jon  Dovey","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of the West of England","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
