{"id":"8EEDDECD-04BD-45F7-A5B7-7C0A3D0BD6FE","title":"The Nazi concentration camps: an online resource","abstractText":"The proposed research will create the first major online resource about the Nazi concentration camps. The historical significance of the camps is beyond doubt. They stood at the heart of Nazi terror, playing a major role in the establishment of the Third Reich, the eradication of resistance, the assault on social outsiders and, most critically, the war against the Jews. And yet, popular understanding of the camps and the Holocaust remains sketchy. These gaps in popular knowledge are caused, in part, by the difficulty of accessing reliable information and documentation. The project will help to address this issue. In collaboration with the UCL Centre for Holocaust Education, it will use new technologies to bring the camps' history to students, educators and the general public.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/N003411/1","grantId":"AH/N003411/1","fundValue":"53369","fundStart":"2016-02-02","fundEnd":"2016-11-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Nikolaus  Wachsmann","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Birkbeck College","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
