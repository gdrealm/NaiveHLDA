However, mitochondria are often also required for killing cells through a process called apoptosis. Through their ability to regulate life and death, mitochondria play many critical roles in health and disease. As such, understanding how mitochondria contribute to a specific process can allow its therapeutic targeting in disease. \n\nIn addition to energy production and inducing apoptosis, mitochondria have recently been proposed to regulate a variety of other important processes. These include non-apoptotic forms of cell death, a stress-response mechanism called autophagy and immunity. However, demonstrating that mitochondria are required for these processes has proved enormously challenging, largely due to the lack of appropriate tools. Ideally, one would like to remove mitochondria and assess how this affects the cellular process of interest. \n\nThis proposal centres upon developing and applying a new approach to understand the cellular functions of mitochondria. We will utilise a cellular process called mitophagy as a research tool. In this process, mitochondria are selectively depleted from a cell. This provides an opportunity to investigate biological processes in mitochondria-free cells. We will use mitophagy to define mitochondrial importance and functions in a non-apoptotic form of cell death called necroptosis. We will also apply these approaches to systematically address how mitochondria regulate autophagy. Both necroptosis and autophagy have various roles in health, disease and aging. Finally, we aim to further develop our mitophagy-based approach to understand mitochondrial function. Specifically, we will develop a chemical independent means of inducing mitophagy. This will expand the utility of mitophagy as a tool to understanding mitochondrial function to a variety of cell types and also enable its in vivo use. Ultimately, better understanding of mitochondrial function should help us manipulate processes, such as necroptosis and autophagy, in disease.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/K008374/1","grantId":"BB/K008374/1","fundValue":"307962","fundStart":"2013-07-01","fundEnd":"2016-12-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Stephen  Tait","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
