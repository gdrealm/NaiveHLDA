One very important biological mechanism is the way in which one protein recognises and binds to another protein in order to regulate its function. This functional regulation by protein-protein interactions underpins most of the biological activity in living cells, and yet we do not understand what properties of a protein allow it to bind to another, nor do we understand how to design molecules to prevent or enhance such interactions. Gaining such an understanding would be a huge advance. It is estimated that there are approximately 650,000 types of specific protein-protein interactions in each human cell. This means that there are potentially 650,000 targets for modifying biological function by the use of drugs. Essentially every part of the biological process, and therefore every disease, could in principle be addressed by such drugs. Although the knowledge of how to do this remains beyond our grasp, progress has been made in some parts of the problem, and new ways of looking at the problem have also been developed with others already in development. This research network has the aim of bringing the whole UK community engaged in this type of research together, and in particular connecting the scientists in universities and research institutes with the scientists in biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies to pool their intellectual and technical capabilities. In doing this we have two main aims in mind. Firstly the sharing of knowledge so that everyone has a wider picture of what is now possible and understood and what still needs to be learned and discovered. Secondly the formulation of a UK-wide plan to solve the outstanding problems in this area with the intention of accelerating the development of new drugs for serious illnesses by connecting together progress made by the various research teams across the UK.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I037210/1","grantId":"EP/I037210/1","fundValue":"73527","fundStart":"2011-05-09","fundEnd":"2013-11-08","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The Protein-Protein Interactions Network (PPI-Net) is a National Network for Protein-Protein Interactions (PPI) which starting April 2011. The Networkwas jointly funded by Engineering and Physical Science Research Council (EPSRC), Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC), and the Medical Research Council (MRC) between April 2011 - March 2013, with a no-cost extension until September 2013. The funding support the development of this national network, a national and an international conference alongside various placements, discussion and working groups. In the course of the funded period, PPI-net produced a community landscape document out-ling capacity, capability and opportunities in this area.
