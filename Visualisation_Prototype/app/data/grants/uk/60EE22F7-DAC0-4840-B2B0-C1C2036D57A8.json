{"id":"60EE22F7-DAC0-4840-B2B0-C1C2036D57A8","title":"In vivo selection of bioprocessable biopharmaceuticals","abstractText":"Biopharmaceuticals (or biologics) are medicines that are made from biological materials, most usually proteins. The UK is a prominent stakeholder in this sector, which is growing in importance as biologics are often more specific to their target in the body and have fewer side effects. The development and production of biologics is, however, a labour and time intensive process. Many promising therapeutic proteins are never commercialised due to problems with self-association (aggregation). Failure of these 'candidate' therapeutics at a late stage of development is expensive to both industry and society as these therapies are usually indicated for serious life-threatening or life-limiting conditions. The aim of this project is to assess the ability of a screen developed by the applicants to identify candidate therapeutics at an early stage of development that are inherently resistant to aggregation. This would reduce the cost of development and reduce the failure rate of promising therapies for serious diseases.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/M01259X/1","grantId":"BB/M01259X/1","fundValue":"113379","fundStart":"2015-06-01","fundEnd":"2016-05-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"David John Brockwell","coPersons":["Sheena E Radford"],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
