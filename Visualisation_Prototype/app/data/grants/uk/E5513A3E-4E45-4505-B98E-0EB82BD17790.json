Without a compact hydrogen storage material for vehicle applications, there is unlikely to be any significant displacement in the use of fossil fuels for transportation. A major drawback to most high capacity solid state hydrogen storage materials is the high decomposition temperature needed to release the hydrogen. Multicomponent hydrides (e.g. mixing a complex hydride with a binary hydride) offers the only solution to maintain high storage capacities (&gt;9wt.%) and tailor the thermodynamics of the system to give 1 bar equilibrium temperature &lt;150oC. This project will design novel multicomponent systems employing material design strategies like dopant destabilisation, dehydrogenation catalysts and nanoporous containment to design and experimentally validate novel multicomponent hydride systems with high storage capacities, able to be cycled at temperatures below 150oC. The delivery of such a system will mark a step change in the performance of solid state hydrogen storage materials and will deliver a viable storage technology for a range of fuel cell applications.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F061919/1","grantId":"EP/F061919/1","fundValue":"429460","fundStart":"2009-01-01","fundEnd":"2013-06-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Gavin Stuart Walker","coPersons":["David Malcolm Grant"],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":" The work between Nottingham, Institute of Metals Research and Fudan University has led to new understanding of multicomponent systems based on lithium borohydride. This has included understanding the thermodynamic process by which hydrogen can be released at lower temperatures and catalyst additions to speed up the rate of dehydrogenation. These materials have been found to cycle well and have potential to be exploited for hydrogen storage applications. Solid state hydrogen storage systems where there is a high quality waste heat source. The mechanistic understanding has helped other groups in understanding reactions with their multicomponent systems. Further reduction in the operating temperature is needed for these materials to be exploited for commercial applications. Energy","dataset":"gtr"}
