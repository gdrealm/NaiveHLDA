We now want to use advanced brain imaging to test a possible treatment to reduce brain damage. Melatonin, a substance produced naturally by the brain and taken by many people to combat jet-lag seems to protect the immature brain from damage due to shortages of oxygen or infection. We want to see if it prevents brain damage in premature infants.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0502100","grantId":"G0502100","fundValue":"506759","fundStart":"2007-04-27","fundEnd":"2011-08-26","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"David  Edwards","coPersons":["Denis V Azzopardi","Mary Ann  Rutherford"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
