{"id":"9C06BF9E-3569-4E23-BBBA-D5BB8AE81498","title":"The chitinase family: Does sibling rivalry shape lung homeostasis, inflammation, and response to helminth-induced damage?","abstractText":"Chitin is a sugar molecule found abundantly in nature and the human lung is repeatedly exposed to chitin due to inhalation of fungal spores and other debris such as insect faeces. Mammals do not make chitin but secrete extremely large amounts of 'chitinases', proteins that can bind and breakdown chitin. The genes that code for these chitinases are very ancient and they exist in all animals, presumably to fight infection with organisms, like yeast, that contain chitin. Additionally, mammals may need to break down the large volume of chitin inhaled everyday as there is evidence that chitin itself triggers inflammation in the lung. However, this role for breaking down chitin in the lung is not sufficient to explain all the different places in the body in which these proteins are found. Also, all mammals have two different chitinase proteins but also contain several more proteins, called chitinase-like proteins (CLPs) that are very similar but can no longer break down chitin. The function of these CLPs is completely unknown but they are secreted by cells of the immune system during allergic responses and infection with worms. They are also associated with some forms of cancer and seemed to be turned on in response to injury. The purpose of this application is try to understand the difference between the active chitinases and these CLPs. We know that both are expressed at very high levels in the lung during an allergic response and we are going to use a mouse model to manipulate these proteins to reveal their function. Our preliminary work suggests that the chitinases and CLPs have opposing roles in the lung and may have evolved to regulate each other. To test this hypothesis, we propose to use blockers to the chitinases and the CLPs both alone and in combination and in mice that are deficient in each of these genes. We can also transfer DNA into mice that will lead to production of these proteins in the lungs of normal mice. We can then compare the effects they have on lung tissue. This work is important because these proteins are found in a vast array of diseases of both humans and animals and we are remarkably ignorant of what they do. Importantly, our collaborators are developing specific inhibitors that can be used to block either the chitinases or the CLPs that could be used as drugs in the future. This work, therefore, has the potential to be translated into therapies in situations where these proteins may be contributing to disease.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/J001929/1","grantId":"MR/J001929/1","fundValue":"419517","fundStart":"2012-03-15","fundEnd":"2015-03-14","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Judith  Allen","coPersons":["Richard Michael  Maizels"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
