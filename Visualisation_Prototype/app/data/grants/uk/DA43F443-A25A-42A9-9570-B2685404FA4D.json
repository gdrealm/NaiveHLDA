The series will be multi-disciplinary and embrace a variety of different methodologies with presentations from international experts as well as early career researchers.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The programme of seminars focuses on: </p> \n<ul> \n <li>Theoretical, empirical and educational perspectives on reading comprehension </li> \n <li>Language foundations of reading comprehension </li> \n <li>Working memory and text comprehension </li> \n <li>Interventions to promote reading comprehension. </li>\n</ul>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-451-25-4287","grantId":"RES-451-25-4287","fundValue":"15363","fundStart":"2006-11-01","fundEnd":"2008-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  Two of the organisers were invited to join a government working party to consider the inclusion of comprehension-related activities in the Foundation Years curriculum.
