X-rays are electromagnetic waves, and are therefore characterized not only by their amplitude, which is changed by absorption, but also by their phase. Pioneering experiments carried out in the nineties at large and expensive facilities called synchrotrons showed that phase effects can solve the main problem of x-ray imaging, low image contrast due to small absorption differences. This both enhances the visibility of all details in an image, and allows the detection of features invisible to conventional x-ray methods. The benefits this could bring to fields as diverse as medicine, biology, material science, etc were immediately understood, but an effective translation into real-world applications failed because it looked like using a synchrotron was necessary to obtain significant image enhancements.Recently, the PI developed a technique (coded-aperture phase contrast imaging) which showed that this is not true. This technique allows achieving advantages comparable to those obtained at synchrotrons with conventional x-ray sources. This makes the above transformation a concrete possibility for the first time.Although a complete transformation will take longer than the five years of the project, we will seed it by running a series of pilot experiments which will:1) explore the potential of the proposed approach and adapt it to applications in a variety of important fields;2) develop new scientific instruments allowing studies which until now were only possible at synchrotrons to be carried out in conventional labs;3) develop new x-ray methods which will allow the investigation of new scientific fields currently inaccessible.The technique invented by the PI will be applied in new areas of medicine, security, material science, and others. In medicine, we will tackle problems such as imaging blood vessels without contrast agents, enabling earlier detection of breast and other cancers and of osteoporosis, and developing new contrast agents to allow physiological studies with x-rays. We will develop strategies to substantially reduce x-ray dose, which would make radiology safer and allow the expansion of screening campaigns. In security, we will improve threat detection and material recognition. In material science, we will develop tools to detect defects in new materials (e.g. composites, the basis of future aerospace and transport industry, currently posing a challenge to existing test tools) and to allow earlier detection of cracks and corrosion in metals and defects in plastics.Phase-based x-ray scanners will be developed to enable microscopic studies of cells and detection of plaques and metal concentration in tissues in a conventional laboratory setting. X-ray phase methods will be combined with other, functional imaging modalities to develop a new generation of small-animal scanners which will be used in biology and drug development.At synchrotrons, we will combine the increased phase sensitivity of the method developed by the PI with other, cutting-edge methods to push the sensitivity of phase techniques further. These methods will be used to study important scientific areas currently inaccessible, e.g. the mechanisms of tumour invasion.The group will disseminate the obtained results both to specialized audiences (through scientific publications and conference presentations) and to the general public (through public engagement activities). We will collaborate with industry to ensure that the outcome of the applied elements of the research programme are taken to the exploitation stage, and therefore that its full impact is realized. The group will become a world-leading team and produce a step change in x-ray science and its application, to the benefit of society as a whole and UK plc in particular.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I021884/1","grantId":"EP/I021884/1","fundValue":"1049890","fundStart":"2011-11-01","fundEnd":"2016-10-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The technology can be considered to be still in its infancy however there are significant signs it will exploited up in the near future: we received expressions of interest from approximately 10 companies, have signed an agreement with one (for exploitation in NDT/metrology/industrial/security screening) and are about to sign a second one for exploitation in medical imaging. We have deliberately left out pre-clinical applications as we are currently discussing options with two companies, meaning this could soon materialise in the form of a third industrial agreement. For the time being companies have asked to remain confidential but press releases will be issued in due time. Industrial prototypes are currently under construction, and we expect the first ones will be operational by the end of the grant.

Generally speaking, the use of phase in x-ray imaging leads to highly increased image quality and improved feature detection - to the extent that details invisible to conventional x-rays can be detected by phase-based methods.\n\nAs a means to achieve points a) and b) above, I am establishing a large international collaboration centered on the activities of my group. Substantial collaborations have already been initiated, notably with three synchrotrons (Diamond in UK, the ESRF in France and ELETTRA in Italy). Experiments have been conducted at all these facilities and set-ups based on my method installed at all three synchrotrons. This has already resulted in the development of a new method with 10-100 times more phase sensitivity than those currently available (paper published in Phys. Rev. Lett.).\n\nAdditional new collaborations that have been established in the framework of this grant and are already active include:\n\n- Imperial College to look at a) cartilage diseases (M. Marenzana) b) composite materials (P. Robinson) c) scaffolds for regenerative medicine (J. Jones);\n\n- ICH to look at new methods in regenerative medicine (P. De Coppi);\n\n- John Vane Science Centre to study tumour invasion mechanism (L. Jones);\n\n- The Ludwig-Maximillian University in Munich to study dose reduction mechanisms in Radiology (P. Coan); the ESRF (A. Bravin) is also a partner on this activity;\n\n- The University of Oxford on a) the development of new, microbubble-based contrast agents (E. Stride) and b) use of phase methods in monitoring treatment response in small-animal models (B. Vojnovic);\n\n- Diamond, MARS Bioimaging and Pixirad on the use of spectroscopic pixellated detectors for single-shot phase retrieval methods;\n\n- the University of Strathclyde (D. Jaroszynski) on the application of our mehtods with new x-ray sources.\n\nA number of industrial collaborations have also been initiated as well, the details of which are still confidential at this early stages of the project. As mentioned above, ultimately we expect the technology to be deployed worldwide in a range of non-academic contexts which will include hospital, clinics, industry, customs, etc Industry has been heavily engaged in our activity since the start of the grant, as a consequence of exploitation routes having been incorporated in the original project plan. In addition to this we regularly present our results to industrial actors worldwide and hold regular meetings/workshops with diverse audiences. Ideally we would like to pursue applications of our technology on the widest possible number of applications, including e.g. medicine, biology, cultural heritage, material science, non-destructive testing, security, etc. Energy,Environment,Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology,Security and Diplomacy,Transport,Other","dataset":"gtr"}
