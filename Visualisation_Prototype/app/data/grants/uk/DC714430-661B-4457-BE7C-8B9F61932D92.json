{"id":"DC714430-661B-4457-BE7C-8B9F61932D92","title":"A collaboration in functional electroceramics through people exchange","abstractText":"The functional electroceramics market is multibillion pounds in value and growing year by year. Electroceramic components are vital to the operation of a wide variety of home electronics, mobile communications, computer, automotive and aerospace systems. The UK ceramics industry tends to focus on a number of specialist markets and there are new opportunities in sensors, communications, imaging and related systems as new materials are developed. To enable the UK ceramics community to benefit from the new and emerging techniques for the processing and characterisation of functional electroceramics a series of collaborative exchanges will be undertaken between the three UK universities (Manchester, Sheffield and Imperial College) and universities and industry in Europe (Austria, Germany, Russia, Czech Republic), the USA and Asia (Japan, Taiwan and Singapore). These exchanges will enable the UK researchers (particularly those at an early stage of their careers) to learn new experimental and theoretical techniques. This knowledge and expertise will be utilised in the first instance in the new bilateral collaborative projects, and transferred to the UK user communities (UK universities and UK industry). A number of seminars and a two day Workshop will be held to help the dissemination of knowledge.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F012403/1","grantId":"EP/F012403/1","fundValue":"151216","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-05-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Robert  Freer","coPersons":["Derek  Sinclair","Ian Michael Reaney","Neil  Alford","Colin  Leach","Anthony Roy West"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
