A network of microtubules stretches through the cell, connecting important destinations. In much the same way that countries transport cargo along railway lines, so cells transport cargo along microtubules.\n\nNot surprisingly, microtubules are crucial to the life of cells. In particular, they are needed for cell division, when a tremendous amount of re-organization takes place. \n\nThe building block of microtubules is a protein called tubulin. Several important cancer treatments work by binding to tubulin and preventing the cell from re-organizing its microtubules. \n\nTo improve existing cancer medicines, and to find new ones, we need to understand the programme of shape-changes that tubulin undergoes as it assembles into microtubules. We have found a way to obtain very pure tubulin from yeast. We are analysing its fine structure, and the way this structure changes as the tubulin building-blocks assemble themselves into microtubules.\n\nOur project is an example of basic structural biology, applied to a problem of great medical importance.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0200542","grantId":"G0200542","fundValue":"499007","fundStart":"2003-07-01","fundEnd":"2008-06-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Robert Anthony Cross","coPersons":["Linda Ann Amos","Jan  Lowe"],"organisation":"Marie Curie Cancer Care","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
