Our aim is monitor, model and predict the marine environment in order to improve its sustainable use. Thus, we deliver cutting edge multidisciplinary research &amp; education in marine processes and climate, marine biotechnology, biodiversity, extreme environments and marine renewable energy. To meet our need for bespoke integration of large interdisciplinary marine environmental datasets, we request high performance processing, storage resources and an improved internet connection. This local repository will facilitate efficient data management and increase our modelling and analysis capability by alleviating the complexity associated with using multiple remote High Performance Computing (HPC) facilities.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/L013029/1","grantId":"NE/L013029/1","fundValue":"338243","fundStart":"2013-11-04","fundEnd":"2014-04-03","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Claire Marie Gachon","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Scottish Association For Marine Science","findingsText":" To meet our need for bespoke integration of large interdisciplinary marine environmental datasets, we were awarded funds to purchase high performance processing &amp;\nstorage resources.
