The sufferer and their family have to learn to live with the illness and its consequences. The UK government is concerned about the extent of chronic ill health and the cost of providing quality services to all who need them. This has led to a major rethink. As a result, there are a number of new requirements for health and social services. These include recognising the expert knowledge that the person with a long term (or chronic) condition has developed over time and introducing ways to help them to manage their symptoms. Professionals are being asked to work in partnership with people with long term conditions, so that the individual is in control of their treatment and care plan and what happens as a result. More and more of us are using technologies in our everyday lives. This four year project will look at how technologies can be used to help individuals and their families to manage the consequences of long tem conditions and maintain quality of life, supported by professionals. It will involve:- 1.Identifying the technologies that are capable of providing relevant information to users with long term conditions so that they can be helped to achieve realistic life goals, agreed through their therapy plan2.Working with users and health care staff to test which are the best technologies for this purpose, how devices can be most appropriately used and what the best forms of information feedback are.For this project, we have decided to focus upon three very different conditions. The first is stroke. People who have a stroke were often fit and well beforehand. Stroke can leave the person suddenly physically disabled. Treatment and rehabilitation can continue for a long time to help recover mobility and ability to communicate. The second condition is chronic pain. This is a symptom of many long term illnesses and leads to very poor quality of life for sufferers. The third is heart failure. People with heart failure are restricted in what they can do and often have to go into hospital if their condition suddenly gets worse.We have chosen these conditions because the technology we develop will have to be capable of meeting differing needs. The last phase of our project will involve asking people from each of these user groups to test the technology in their own homes so that we can find out the extent to which it is helpful in assisting them to make necessary changes to their behaviour. An example of how the technology might be introduced to a person following stroke is as follows; Following discharge from hospital a community therapist visits the person in their home. The therapist undertakes a full assessment of need. They then log onto the home based computer and customise a programme of activity to meet the needs of the user using the 'stroke toolkit' element of the system, The person and the therapist then look at the library of life goals on the system and agree which the user would like to achieve or maintain over the next few months e.g. they may wish to be able to go to their allotment, to church or simply be able to get up from their bed to the bathroom during the night without falling over. The therapist then shows them how to wear a small sensing device which will record over time the amount or type of activity they are doing (walking, sitting, standing) and the quality of the activity they undertake. Once the user has practiced the programme of activity with exercises, understands how to score the achievement of their agreed goals and can attach the small sensors they will be left to manage their own individualised therapy plan. They are able to obtain feedback on progress through their computer and through email messages sent by the therapist who will be monitoring the user's progress from their place of work.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F002815/1","grantId":"EP/F002815/1","fundValue":"766169","fundStart":"2008-01-01","fundEnd":"2012-06-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Gail Anne Mountain","coPersons":["Sue  Mawson","Tricia  Ware","Peter  Wright"],"organisation":"Sheffield Hallam University","findingsText":" The technology resulting from this project is called a 'Personalised Self Management System'. It is an integrated platform comprising of a touch screen home hub and a touch screen mobile device with additional functionality to meet the needs of people with specific health conditions namely chronic heart failure, chronic pain and stroke. For example the system for people with chronic heart failure includes weighing scales and a blood pressure monitor. The aim is to help users to independently manage the consequences of their long term condition and retain or improve their quality of life by increasing their physical activity. This is process is called self management. We are also aware of the importance of helping people to independently continue with rehabilitation exercises if this is important to their condition. \n\nThe technology (which is for use in the person's own home and community) requires the individual to identify realistic lifestyle goals which can then be achieved through graded physical activity. The device guides the user in working towards their identified goal, providing motivating individualised feedback based on their progress. The user is provided with educational information about their condition. The device also includes therapeutic rehabilitation exercises, providing guidance that is specific to the particular long term condition and the user's progress. We have tested the prototype with people with chronic heart failure and people with chronic pain, leaving it with them to use in their daily lives for a period of time and initial results are very promising. The version of the device for people with stroke has presented greater challenges, due in part to the overall neglect of the self managing needs of this group. We have incorporated a novel technology (in the form of a smart insole to be placed in the shoe) within this version of the device. We are evaluating the insole with people with stroke to determine the value of the feedback it provides for improving balance and gait. \n\nThe findings to date are as follows; \n\no There is insufficient practice and associated research into how to assist individuals with specific complex long term conditions to self manage. \n\no Our work confirms the importance of including self managed rehabilitation alongside self management for many long term conditions so that function can be maintained and in some cases regained. \n\no Features of the technology itself can also be used successfully to support and sustain changes to behaviour. Alternatively, malfunctioning or badly designed devices rapidly erode motivation. \n\no People with long term conditions need a portable, personalised solution which can enable them to self manage while at the same time allowing them to carry on with their daily life and work. \n\no Evaluations of the device with people with chronic heart failure and chronic pain have confirmed that the design decisions and choice of technology taken earlier in the project is appropriate. Our initial idea of identifying and integrating existing devices and exploiting their potential rather than re-engineering new solutions is proving fit for purpose. The process and outputs of the SMART2 project has been showcased to many different audiences. We have exploited our position within the KT-EQUAL Consortium to ensure that the project is accessible to different stakeholders. \n\nOur future intention is to forge alliances with GP commissioners with assistance from our expert in primary care/ public health to identify how the Personalised Self Management System might be incorporated into services. We will also work with secondary and primary care providers to determine where the PSMS might interface with existing care pathways and potentially substitute for existing services. We have extensive experience of working with commissioners and providers to facilitate the adoption of Telehealth and are fully aware of the many issues that can arise within different levels of an organisation when planning commences to introduce a new technology; for example commitment at managerial level does not always translate to front line staff where there can be significant concerns about changes to established practice and needs for staff training. \n The SMART Consortium is now leading the field in technology enhanced self managed rehabilitation. \n\nA follow on project funded through the National Institute for Health Research Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care in South Yorkshire (http://clahrc-sy.nihr.ac.uk/) is extending the remit of the Personalised Self Management System to meet the needs of people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In so doing we are moving towards adding elements to the core system to meet the needs of people with other long term conditions or a mix of co-morbidities. \n\nThe technology is now resulting in interest from potential industrial partners. Our aim is to create such a partnership to exploit the technology. We will also be seeking funding from the National Institute for Health Research to rigorously evaluate the system. \n\nThe introduction of GP commissioning combined with the anticipated outcome of the Comprehensive Spending Review (no growth in health service provision) creates significant opportunities for the future adoption of this technology. This is because the technology will promote the independence of the individual user, provide timely indications to them of any decline and reduce reliance upon health services. The current and anticipated numbers of people with long term conditions nationally and globally makes this an attractive proposition. The introduction of personalised budgets for social care and the current pilots of personalised budgets for health provide further opportunities in that those in future receipt of these budgets could choose to purchase the technology to assist them to self manage. Finally there are opportunities for this technology to be provided through the private health care sector. Healthcare","dataset":"gtr"}
