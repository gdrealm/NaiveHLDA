This led to a rapid and sustained tumour regression over one month, with disappearance of 90% of the tested tumours and regression of the remaining ones in a laboratory model. \nBuilding on the promising results already obtained, the proposed project aims to develop new &quot;seek-and-destroy&quot; systems by modifying the iron-carrier, and to evaluate their anti-cancer efficacy on cancer cells in vitro and in vivo after intravenous administration. \nThis innovative research would potentially have a major impact on healthcare, as there is currently no gene medicine commercially available for the intravenous treatment of cancer.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/J007129/1","grantId":"MR/J007129/1","fundValue":"151713","fundStart":"2012-06-01","fundEnd":"2015-05-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Christine  Dufes","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Strathclyde","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
