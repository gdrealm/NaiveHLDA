In addition, when they mate with multiple males, females often favour fertilisation by the sperm of specific partners. Why do females favour certain males over others? It has been suggested that females may select males that carry genes which help the individual cope with their environment and by doing so the females thereby obtain the same high quality paternal genes for her young. This idea remains contentious and little tested. The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is a group of genes that help determine resistance to parasites and diseases in higher animals (i.e. vertebrates, including humans). The type and variety of MHC genes an individual carries determine how well they can cope with parasites and diseases. Females may therefore increase the health of their offspring by selecting mates on the basis of MHC characteristics. This may happen in three different ways. First, females may favour fertilisations by males carrying an MHC that is different from their own. This will ensure that the offspring will inherit many different types of MHC genes (alleles) from their parents, and thus will be able to defend themselves from a wider range of diseases. Second, females may increase the MHC diversity of the offspring by favouring males that have a diverse MHC. Third, females may prefer males carrying specific MHC genes that provide more efficient resistance against diseases than other MHC types currently available. Understanding how MHC diversity influences reproduction is important for our understanding of the evolution of female mate choice, male sexual ornaments (e.g. stags antlers) and reproductive strategies. It may also allow us to better manage fertilisation and fertility problems in domestic and pest species and in species at risk of extinction. Despite much interest in the MHC and reproductive behaviour, the mechanisms through which the MHC may influence reproductive success remain unresolved. Our proposed research investigates the role of the MHC in the reproductive strategies of birds, and aims to determine if and how the different possible MHC-based mechanisms outlined above operate at specific reproductive stages: from mate choice to the selection of sperm within the female reproductive tract after insemination. We will study two semi-natural populations of fowl, Gallus gallus. The fowl is an ideal animal to study for two important reasons. First, it is a model system of reproductive physiology and behaviour and much is known about the mechanisms that determine mating and fertilisation success. Second, the MHC of the fowl is relatively small and easy to study. This has enabled extensive studies of the fowl MHC and its associations with disease resistance: more is known about the link between the MHC and diseases in the fowl than in any other animal. We will first: (a) determine how the MHC of males and/or their similarity with the females MHC females accounts for differences between the reproductive success of different males in small natural groups, (b) experimentally investigate how much the MHC determines male traits (e.g. social status, comb size and sperm quality) which influence a males ability to mate with females, and the fertilising efficiency of their ejaculates, (c) experimentally test whether female preference for certain mates is explained by MHC mechanisms. We will then focus on events occurring during/after insemination, by testing whether: (e) males invest more sperm in certain females based on female MHC characteristics, (f) females preferentially utilise the sperm of certain partners based on male MHC characteristics, and (g) the outcome of the competition between ejaculates that occurs when females copulate with multiple males (as it normally happens in the fowl), is determined by the MHC characteristics of males involved.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/D002788/1","grantId":"NE/D002788/1","fundValue":"127643","fundStart":"2006-05-15","fundEnd":"2009-11-14","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Tommaso  Pizzari","coPersons":["David S Richardson"],"organisation":"University of East Anglia","findingsText":" This was a split award between T Pizzari at Oxford (grant NE/D003865/1) and DS Richardson at UEA (grant NE/D002788/1), with Pizzari as the PI. The same key findings of this award have been entered for both, Oxford and UEA grants. Following advise from ROS Carl Kenneally, the current report presents a comprehensive list of the outcomes of this award (32 entries) relevant to both the Oxford and UEA grants.\n\n\n\nAim 1. We conducted extensive monitoring of paternity skew in 12 replicate groups in which all birds were MHC-typed and characterised for multiple sexually-selected traits, as well as genetic relatedness. Preliminary results indicate a number of key novel features of sexually promiscuous mating systems, including the fact that female promiscuity reduces the overall opportunity for sexual selection while increasing the relative importance of post-insemination selective episodes. We also demonstrated an over-riding effect of male status in determining variation in reproductive success arising before and after insemination. However, after controlling for male status, we showed that pairs with lower genome-wide similarity had a reproductive advantage over pairs that were more genetically similar, indicating a role of MHC similarity as predictor of genome-wide similarity between prospective partners. Aim 2. We detected a strong signature of MHC heterozygosity in the ability of males and females to survive to reproductive maturity (Worley et al. under review). Aim 3. We demonstrated experimentally that the genetic similarity effects outlined in Aim 1 are explained by both male and female preference for genetically dissimilar mating partners. Aim 4. We showed that male fowl allocate sperm differentially according to their MHC similarity with a female (Gillingham et al. 2009 Proc. R. Soc. B). Aim 5. We found that following the first inseminations, females tend to bias paternity in favour of MHC-similar ejaculates, and that over successive inseminations this bias is reversed towards MHC-dissimilar males. Aim 6. We found strong ‘transitive’ seminal fluid effects, whereby the seminal fluid of an ejaculate with high sperm velocity increases the sperm velocity of another ejaculate with initially lower sperm velocity, and vice versa. Importantly, we also found that these effects were significantly more marked when seminal fluid and sperm donor males had intermediate MHC similarity. These results have critical importance for the management of fertility in commercial flocks and have led to a close partnership between the PI and AVIAGEN, a leading industry in the global poultry market. This partnership has already resulted in a CASE NERC/EPSRC PhD project to explore the mechanisms underpinning variation in fertility in AVIAGEN broiler breeder flocks, and we are now in the process to apply for a 'Stand Alone' LINK BBSRC grant to resolve these issues. These results provide a unique insight into the complex dynamics that govern variation in fertilisation success within populations and indicate a potentially important role for MHC similarity and immunity. These findings have led to a follow-on research NERC grant (NE/H008047/1) to explore more explicitly the link between MHC and female immune responses to antigenic properties of sperm in fertilisation dynamics (in collaboration with molecular ecologist David Richardson at UEA and immunologist Adrian Smith at Oxford).
