It integrates recent fossil pollen data with new ecological theories to re-interpret prevailing understandings of environmental change and recent human history. \nVegetation changes over 200 years will be investigated using pollen analysis and these results will be triangulated with archival and written and oral histories of known environmental perturbations. We will develop alternative explanations of perceived environmental degradation based on current ecological thinking, and will integrate methods and theories from the natural sciences in to environmental history.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=119372/1","grantId":"119372/1","fundValue":"30748","fundStart":"2006-09-01","fundEnd":"2008-02-29","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Katherine  WillisLindsey  Gillson","coPersons":["Daniel  Brockington"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
