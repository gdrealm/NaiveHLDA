Our aim is to ensure that, by 2015, Warwick will be in the top 50 world Universities as measured by the quality of research output and the strength of student demand. Following a recent refresh of Vison2015 we have set out four revised objectives for our research as follows:\n\n- Continue to search for, appoint, nurture and reward the most able academic, research and support staff\n\n- Continue to grow PGR numbers\n\n- Re-present our major areas of research strength around the interdisciplinary &quot;grand challenges&quot; currently confronting the world\n\n- Strengthen and reposition the University of Warwick in the light of its refreshed Strategy focussing on the positive impacts on society at large.\n\nThe University welcomes the opportunity to use the unspent balance from our EPSRC research grants for a targeted and strategic programme of activities that will underpin the delivery of these key objectives of our research strategy in engineering and physical sciences. The funds from this award will be used as part of a coordinated series of investments drawing resource from EPSRC (from both this award and the Delivering Impact award), HEFCE (as part of our HEIF strategy) and the University itself (as part of our &pound;500k per annum Research Development Fund).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J014869/1","grantId":"EP/J014869/1","fundValue":"91816","fundStart":"2011-07-01","fundEnd":"2012-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Koen  Lamberts","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
