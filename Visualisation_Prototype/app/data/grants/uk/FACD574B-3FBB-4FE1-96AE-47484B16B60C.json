{"id":"FACD574B-3FBB-4FE1-96AE-47484B16B60C","title":"PREGNANCY AND SUBSTANCE MISUSE: AN ETHNOGRAPHIC STUDY OF MATERNITY SERVICES","abstractText":"This study will set out to investigate substance misusing women's experience of antenatal services. It will explore how they are assesed, monitored and treated, and how they manage and react to these processes. We are particularly interested in how substance misusing women are able to balance their identities as mothers-to-be and substance misusers, and the extent to which they are able to engage with ante-natal services.\n<br />\n<br />We will interview a sample of women to ascertain their experiences of ante-natal services - some of whom may not have disclosed their substance misuse to these services. In addition, we will observe antenatal appointments and ultrasound scans and carry out interviews with midwives, doctors and radiographers. We are interested in how health care practitioners assess and monitor substance misusing pregnant women and on what kinds of evidence they draw in making decisions about the welfare of unborn children. This research will raise questions for the research community about the stigmatisation and regulation of pregnant women and will be of benefit to policy makers and practitioners who are interested in improving the health of substance misusing pregnant women and their babies.\n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F038666/1","grantId":"ES/F038666/1","fundValue":"61084","fundStart":"2008-06-01","fundEnd":"2009-11-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Alexander William Stevens","coPersons":["Polly  Radcliffe"],"organisation":"University of Kent","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
