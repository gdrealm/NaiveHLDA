The novel, synthetic, polymer system will have a putty-like consistency, which is malleable by the surgeon but will set to solid consistency, when placed in contact bone during Orthopaedic surgery. BBSRC Super FoF is required to develop bone void filler, to a detailed and challenging specification. We will optimise the chemistry and formulation of the composite and detailed biomechanical and in vitro biological studies will be made. We intend to prove efficacy and elucidate the biological mechanisms of the osteoinductive properties. Two pre-clinical trials are planned. The research work has the support of S+N, with a commitment to take the project (if successful) into the development of a product for use in the clinic. The benefits to patients will be; improved surgical methods to fill bone voids in revision joint replacements (hips and knees).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/K020331/1","grantId":"BB/K020331/1","fundValue":"499468","fundStart":"2013-07-01","fundEnd":"2015-09-08","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Sandra  DownesJulie  Gough","coPersons":["Judith Alison Hoyland","David Christopher  Watts","Peter Martin Budd"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
