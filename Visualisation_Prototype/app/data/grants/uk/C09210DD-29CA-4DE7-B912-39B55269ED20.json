{"id":"C09210DD-29CA-4DE7-B912-39B55269ED20","title":"Performance Politics: The Dynamics of Political Support in Britain","abstractText":"<p>The Labour government emerged from the 2005 general election with a much reduced majority in the House of Commons.&nbsp;The arrival of David Cameron and Menzies Campbell, together with much publicised problems facing the government such as the Iraq war and cuts in the NHS, has created significantly greater electoral competition in Britain than has existed since 1992. The traditional British election study design emphasised the importance of survey data collection in close proximity to the election, but by then many of the key changes in public opinion have often already taken place.&nbsp;The purpose of this project is to track individual-level changes in voting intentions, attitudes to the political parties, views about the leaders and issue perceptions until 2009/10.&nbsp;This will be done by extending an existing panel survey, which was part of the BES study in 2005, by adding additional waves of interviews to the survey.&nbsp;When the project is complete it will be possible to track the same individuals over seven successive waves or sets of interviews from 2005 to 2009/10.&nbsp;In doing this we will be testing important theoretical debates about the way electors process information and respond to issues and to party leaders.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2049","grantId":"RES-000-22-2049","fundValue":"86003","fundStart":"2007-03-01","fundEnd":"2010-02-28","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Paul  Whiteley","coPersons":["David  Sanders"],"organisation":"University of Essex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
