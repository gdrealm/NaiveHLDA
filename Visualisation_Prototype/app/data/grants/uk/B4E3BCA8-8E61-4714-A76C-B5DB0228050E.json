Patients' experiences and expectations following major illness or injury","abstractText":"<p>The phrase ‘getting back to normal’, often used to describe recovery from an illness or injury, carries with it social expectations that people will recover and that recovery will be a relatively straightforward process. Surprisingly little research has examined recovery from the patient’s perspective and there has been much less research on patients’ experiences of injury compared with that of illness.</p>\n\n<p>This project will undertake a secondary analysis, using thematic and narrative approaches, of 163 qualitative interviews from four datasets. Three datasets are from the Health Experiences Research Group archive, University of Oxford, and the fourth is from the UK Burden of Injury Study. Key aims include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>examination of socially constructed notions of ‘normal’ and ‘getting back to normal’ within patients’ accounts</li>\n\n <li>comparison of patients’ expectations and experiences of recovery from four types of health event (heart attacks, leukaemia, serious injury requiring hospitalisation and a critical state of health requiring admission to intensive care).</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>The research findings and implications for policy and practice will be discussed with stakeholders at a dissemination day conference held at the end of the project and disseminated via a website, conference presentations and in a range of publications for practitioner and academic audiences.<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K006037/1","grantId":"ES/K006037/1","fundValue":"235849","fundStart":"2013-05-01","fundEnd":"2015-04-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Hilary  Thomas","coPersons":["Sarah  Earthy"],"organisation":"University of Hertfordshire","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
