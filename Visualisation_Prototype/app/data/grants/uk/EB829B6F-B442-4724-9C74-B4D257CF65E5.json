In each of three main research areas, research findings answered a number of questions and in so doing contributed findings that, taken together, contribute significantly to knowledge of wartime Southeast Asia and the region's 1940s economic history.\n\nBy May 1942, when Japan controlled all of Southeast Asia, a key issue, and one of the three research areas, was Japan's administration of the region, its microeconomic policies and their impact. Research revealed that the occupation's most fundamental administrative division emerged as Japan came under severe pressure due to military reversals and resource shortages. The Japanese response of instituting autarky not just in countries but small national regions emphasized the relevance of the microeconomic questions identified. One finding was the near ineffectiveness in mobilizing production of a Japanese strategy of command economies and large corporations to replace markets and producer incentives. Small farmers, the largest constituent of Southeast Asian agriculture, cut back output when almost no consumer goods were available in exchange and when high inflation devalued money. Japanese administrators, spread thinly over Southeast Asia's 1.7 million square miles, could not enforce high production. Data on Southeast Asian production, collected for the research area of macroeconomic effects, show sharp output declines (article: &quot;The Japanese occupation of World War II Southeast Asia&quot;).\n\nA principal finding on the health and nutritional impacts of occupation was that, especially under autarkic conditions and growing transport shortages, pre-war divisions between areas specializing in food and non-food production assumed great importance in explaining differential wartime nutritional outcomes. The standard explanation was that in Southeast Asia's major cities, when food was short, people left to return to subsistence farming. Investigation of urban-rural dichotomies resulted in two publications (articles: &quot;Export-led Growth, Gateway Cities and Urban Systems Development in Pre-World War II Southeast Asia&quot;; &quot;Finance and Long-term Development Issues in Southeast Asia&quot;). These led to a further article (&quot;Urban Growth and Change in 1940s Southeast Asia&quot;). It found that famine in Southeast Asia was overwhelmingly a rural phenomenon. Under conditions of food shortage, people migrated to cities. Black markets were documented as fundamental in preventing widespread urban starvation. It was found that, because of this and post-war upheavals, the million city in Southeast Asia was a 1940s occurrence, not one of the 1950s as had previously been argued.\n\nJapan, badly short of resources and capital, favoured highly labour-intensive construction and production methods in Southeast Asia (article: &quot;The Japanese occupation of World War II Southeast Asia&quot;). Findings document hundreds of thousands of Southeast Asians working (often as forced labour) with little more than their bare hands. The Siam-Burma railway is one example. It was also one of the Japanese strategies to counter transport shortages and Southeast Asia's north-south geography. The military needed to move men and supplies east-west.\n\nIn the second main area of macroeconomics, research yielded the first set of GDP statistics for wartime Southeast Asia (working paper: &quot;Financing Japan's World War II Occupation of Southeast Asia&quot;). Falls in GDP rank as among the greatest macroeconomic shocks in nineteenth- and twentieth-century world economic history. Findings on finance show that Japan financed occupation chiefly by printing money (article: &quot;Financing Japan's World War II Occupation of Southeast Asia&quot;; forthcoming article in The Cambridge History of World War II; the article also examines wartime finance in Japan and China); that Southeast Asians transferred as much as a third of national income for Japanese use; and that Japan gained little in Southeast Asia in goods, food or strategic materials (journal article: &quot;Financing Japan's World War II Occupation of Southeast Asia&quot; and forthcoming articles in 2015 in War in History: The Challenge of Finance in World War II Southeast Asia&quot; (with Shinobu Majima). \n\nThe legacies of World War II for Southeast Asia were the third main research area. Independence would not have come so quickly or with such upheaval in the absence of the Japanese occupation. The war's abrupt end in August 1945 created a political vacuum before Allied troops arrived. It allowed chaotic conditions to develop over much of Southeast Asia. Nevertheless, the project's finding reject this as the principal explanation of a post-war divergence in politics and economics of Southeast Asian regimes and favour instead differing pre-war experiences under colonialism as the single most important determinant (article: &quot;The Japanese occupation of World War II Southeast Asia&quot;). Remarkably little research exists on the Japanese World War II occupation of Southeast Asia and little about it, the story of the Siam-Burma railway excepted, seems generally to be known. Already published journal articles have a scholarly impact and will be taken forward by scholars now and in the future, for example in providing the first GDP data for wartime Southeast Asia and in explaining how Japan financed its occupation of the region without actually paying for anything).\n\nA published book (in progress, see above) will likely be the route which has the principal impact on the wider public and which those in the media will turn to when researching World War II in Asia and Southeast Asia.
