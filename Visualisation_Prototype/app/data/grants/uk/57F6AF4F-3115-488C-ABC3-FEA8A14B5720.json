{"id":"57F6AF4F-3115-488C-ABC3-FEA8A14B5720","title":"Visit to Georgia Institute of Technology and Virginia Polytechnic Institute, USA","abstractText":"There are relatively very few researchers in structural dynamics and aeroelasticity who are not satisfied with numerically based investigations such as the use of conventional finite element methods. These researchers endeavour to seek insight into profound and fundamental behaviour of structures, particularly made of composite materials that are increasingly being used in aeronautical design.The prinicipal investigator (PI) is one such researcher in the UK, whereas Professor Dewey Hodges (DH) of the Georgia Institute of Technology (GIT) and Professor Liviu Librescu (LL) of the Virginia Polytechnic Institute (VPI) are two amongst the very few in the USA. The PI shares common research interests in structural dynamics and aeroelasticity with DH and LL who have outstanding record and international reputation in research. The PI intends to visit GIT and VPI for a week in each, to interact with DH, LL and their research teams. The visit will provide mutual motivation and enable the PI, DH and LL to exchange ideas and information in the areas of their research interest. It will thus be possible for the PI to prepare necessary ground work for future collaboration with GIT and VPI and initiate a programme of joint research within the field of aeroelasticity. The PI, DH and LL have overlapping as well as complementary expertise. The computer programmes developed by them will be exchanged. As a spin-off from the visit, the PI will attend the 47th AIAA/ASME/ASCE/AHS/ASC Structures, Structural Dynamics, and Materials Conference and present a paper on the subject.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E006175/1","grantId":"EP/E006175/1","fundValue":"8647","fundStart":"2006-06-28","fundEnd":"2006-09-27","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Ranjan  Banerjee","coPersons":[],"organisation":"City University London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
