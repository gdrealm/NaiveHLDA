G-alpha-s serves as a molecular relay between the signals outside the myocyte and the chain of molecules within it that stop it contracting during pregnancy.\n\nImportantly, the level of G-alpha-s in the muscle of the uterus, the myometrium, as a whole is very high during pregnancy. In myometrium from women in active labour, however, the number of G-alpha-s molecules is greatly reduced suggesting that the myocytes of the myometrium have the ability to shut down G-alpha-s production at term.\n\nWe wish to know what causes this rise and fall in G-alpha-s synthesis. We also know that the bodily inflammatory response can shut down G-alpha-s production. Consequently, we would like to examine whether plant-derived anti-inflammatory chemicals can inhibit this shut-down of G-alpha-s, which in turn may then prevent premature uterine contractions. We will test this by seeing if these anti-inflammatory chemicals can stop small pieces of human myometrium from contracting when inflammatory molecules are present.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0701322","grantId":"G0701322","fundValue":"439014","fundStart":"2008-11-01","fundEnd":"2012-02-28","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Neil Robert Chapman","coPersons":["Dilly  Anumba","Nick  Europe-Finner","Raheela N  Khan"],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
