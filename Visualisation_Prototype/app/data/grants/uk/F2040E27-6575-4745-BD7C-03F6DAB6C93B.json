We have recently shown that this is not always the case and that gene activity differences between males and females can be independent of sex itself and instead come about because of differences in the sex chromosomes. Normally females have two X chromosomes and males an X and a Y chromosome. By studying 'sex reversal' where males have two X chromsomes and females an X and a Y chromosome we found many differences between males and females that are not caused by sex itself but rather by the sex chromosomes. \n\nThis proposal will explore how this additional layer in the regulation of differences between the sexes works. We will explore the possibility that there are specific genes on the X chromosome which cause these differences by acting as switches to turn on or off many other genes that are not on the X and Y chromosome. Another possibility is that one of the X-chromosomes, the one that is shut-down in every cell in females (to balance with males who have only one X chromosome) sequesters important regulatory factors thereby reducing their availabilty in females. Such a sequestration mechanism could lead to many genes being regulated differently in females. We can test this idea by introducing the mechanism that normally shuts down the X chromosome to another chromosomes and looking for the sex differences in males that we previously found only in females. Understanding the mechanism whereby sex differences come about is important for understanding how strong sex bias arises in many diseases, and will give further insight into the underlying mechanisms and hence open up new therapeutic avenues in the future.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/J007943/1","grantId":"MR/J007943/1","fundValue":"690757","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2016-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Richard J Festenstein","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
