For this it has developed the cornified envelope, a strengthening matrix of interlinked proteins on the outer epidermal layers with a surrounding water-resistant lipid coat. Changes in either the matrix or lipid may result in defects which can be life threatening. \n\nThere are seven members of the transglutaminase enzyme family in the skin. Some are recognized as crucial in developing the cornified envelope, and their altered expression plays a role in a variety of debilitating diseases. However the precise roles of other family members are unknown and it is this we are studying. \n \nOur work studies the importance the transglutaminases by experimentally changing their expression levels in the skin of mice to discover if their misregulation is related with disease. In later studies we will follow the roles of these enzymes in the response of the skin to challenges such as to infection or during healing. Our goal is to understand why the skin has developed such a complex family of enzymes and by understanding their functions provide the basis for the design of novel treatments for human skin diseases.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0501515","grantId":"G0501515","fundValue":"445316","fundStart":"2006-12-01","fundEnd":"2009-11-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Neil Robert Smyth","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
