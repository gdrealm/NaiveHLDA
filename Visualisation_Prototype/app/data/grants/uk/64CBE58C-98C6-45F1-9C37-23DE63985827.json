But this leaves open the questions\\n(i) what exactly are the correct assertability conditions, \\n(ii) what should one say about such conditionals when they occur in unasserted contexts (for example, as beliefs, or as parts of complex sentences), and \\n(iii) what reasons are there for believing that these are the right truth-conditions in the first place?\\n\\nMy project is to answer these questions.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/H006230/1","grantId":"AH/H006230/1","fundValue":"29022","fundStart":"2010-09-01","fundEnd":"2010-12-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Adam  Rieger","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
