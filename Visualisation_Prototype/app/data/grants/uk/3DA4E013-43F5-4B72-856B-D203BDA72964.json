{"id":"3DA4E013-43F5-4B72-856B-D203BDA72964","title":"Workshop: modern trends in controlled stochastic processes: theory and applications","abstractText":"After preliminary contacts, we have 28 overseas participants and 7 prospective British participants from outside Liverpool. If we add 5 members of staff and research students of the Division of Statistics and Probability (Uni. of Liverpool) we obtain the full preliminary list which can be enlarged by other members of staff of the Dept. of Mathematical Sciences (Uni. of Liverpool). According to the title, there will be a good balance between purely mathematical issues like construction of the controlled models, their properties, approximations etc, and practical applications based on the developed theory, like congestion management in Internet, risk management in economics and insurance, inventory control and optimal interventions in epidemics. At the moment, we have the draft schedule of the workshop, described in the Timetable. The participants will be allowed to give 30-35-minute long official presentations. Besides they will have plenty of time to communicate informally, to create and develop research links. As can be seen from the Case for Support, the workshop will involve several world leading scientists, along with talented young researchers and PhD students.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M017206/1","grantId":"EP/M017206/1","fundValue":"31831","fundStart":"2015-06-08","fundEnd":"2016-02-07","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"A  Piunovskiy","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
