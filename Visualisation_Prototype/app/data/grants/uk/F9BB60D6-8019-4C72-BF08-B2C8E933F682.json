{"id":"F9BB60D6-8019-4C72-BF08-B2C8E933F682","title":"Side-channel Resistant Cryptographic IP for Smartcards","abstractText":"Cryptographic IP cores are widely used in smartcards; however, regardless of the mathematical security of a cryptographic algorithm, a hardware implementation of the cryptographic algorithm can leak sensitive information correlated to the secret key(s) being used through side-channels. Next generation standards make it mandatory to protect against such attacks. The project seeks to gain further data to underpin the technical understanding of a technology developed through formal security validation. In turn to allow more detailed assessment of economic feasibility that can be scrutinised by industrial partners and regulatory authorities alike.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G005273/1","grantId":"EP/G005273/1","fundValue":"120644","fundStart":"2008-09-01","fundEnd":"2009-11-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  There have been attempts to commercialise methods for designing crypto-resistance in Galois Encoded Logic on demand.

They implemented the research conducted and by products of SCRIPT in collaboration with Renesas Labs, Japan.\nThe chips were a proof-of-concept silicon to support two new patent disclosures to Newcastle's Business Development Directorate Unit. The results of the chip and work based on secure HDL \ndriven design inspired work on building synthesisable clock generators for Provable Unclonable Functions and on-demand clocking.
