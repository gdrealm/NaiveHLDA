Predicted conditions and adaptive plant traits for the northern Mediterranean Basin are also applicable to the southern, non-European side and will be relevant to Stakeholders representing farmers from that region. The phenotypic responses of a tailored barley germplasm diversity set that is relevant to resilience, sustainability, and quality will be determined under anticipated conditions of altered water and nutrients, CO2, and pathogen pressure. The set will include cultivated barley, landraces from key European production regions differing in aridity and pre-figuring climate change effects, and wild barley from the Fertile Crescent, which represents the gene pool from which domestication occurred and also carries resilience adaptations. These responses will be connected to genes and genome regions by Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) using extensive sequence variant, epigenome, and transcript abundance datasets, and by ecogeographic analysis. The genetic and genomic data sets will be leveraged from earlier (barley 9K SNP set; exome capture) and ongoing (WHEALBI exome capture) studies, which will serve to define the germplasm included in WP1, and will be complemented by planned ClimBar studies (ChIP, small RNA). Therefore, a very large amount of mostly transcribed sequence information will be available to declare and use polymorphisms with a density of coverage and representativeness of germplasm exceeding all previous efforts in this species. Plant phenotyping will be carried out under field conditions within regions expected to experience differing climate change scenarios, and under controlled greenhouse conditions where detailed physiological phenotypes will be collected. Genes and landraces and CWR associated with environmental conditions will be identified by ecogeographic analysis of genetic diversity. Based on observed plant responses and predicted climate scenarios, proposals for genomic selection (GS) and ideotype models for 2070 will be developed, and relevance to interim conditions assessed. Collaborative interactions with agro-economic modellers as well as climatic modellers will set up to estimate harvests in 2070 and their impact on the agro-economy, based on data collected within ClimBar","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/M018466/1","grantId":"BB/M018466/1","fundValue":"296322","fundStart":"2015-02-02","fundEnd":"2018-02-01","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Robbie  Waugh","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Dundee","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
