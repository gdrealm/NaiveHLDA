It has been known for some time that combinations of elements not involving carbon (called inorganic materials) can have important uses in areas from electronics, computing and UV protection in products, to harnessing energy from the sun. In particular, when inorganic particles are very small, typically made up of a few hundred atoms (called nanomaterials), they can have unusual and exciting properties. The discovery of such nanomaterials is very much hampered by our inability to make these materials fast enough and then to be able to test them adequately for their properties.The proposed research seeks to develop a new, faster way of making and discovering inorganic nanomaterials that can absorb sunlight (as an free energy source), and use this energy to split water into its constituents, hydrogen and oxygen (in a process known as photocatalysis). The hydrogen can then be used for powering cars or devices of the future. Such a process is important to sustain the energy requirements of mankind on this earth when our fossil fuels (e.g. oil) are exhausted.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D038499/2","grantId":"EP/D038499/2","fundValue":"774376","fundStart":"2007-05-01","fundEnd":"2010-01-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Jawwad  Darr","coPersons":["Julian Richard Evans","Zheng Xiao  Guo","James  Elliott","Ihtesham Ur Rehman"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
