{"id":"0504FC27-8DD3-4EC7-910C-761332CDA227","title":"Politics and Emotions","abstractText":"<p>Politicians, political managers and activists become aware from time to time of the vital role that emotions play in politics.&nbsp;An emotion like anger not only drives mobs to violence; it can also galvanise citizens to take part in a political movement which fights injustice.&nbsp;Fear gives rise to attempts to guarantee homeland security. It may also be the spur for dialogue and understanding.&nbsp;In this research seminar series we seek to give emotions in politics their due.&nbsp;In particular, our aim is to show that both reason and emotion are always present in political thought and action.&nbsp;By developing an innovative framework for understanding the emotions, we want to examine the patterns and flows of affect in different political environments.&nbsp;Our hope is that these seminars will open up a new space in which we can think about the emotions involved in politics, and about the politics of the emotions. The seminars will be held in December 2006, February 2007, June 2007, October 2007, February 2008 and June 2008.&nbsp;They will focus on the following topics: Emotion, Antagonism and Deliberation, Politics and Fear, The Affective Dimension of Political Mobilization, Managing the Emotions of Failure in the Public Services, The Politics of Reparation, and Politics and the Triumph of the Therapeutic.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-451-25-4281","grantId":"RES-451-25-4281","fundValue":"7437","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2008-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Simon  Thompson","coPersons":["Andrew Mark Cooper","Catherine  Fieschi","Paul  Hoggett","Jessica  Evans"],"organisation":"University of the West of England","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
