Inside the body EBV attempts to hide from our normal defences, although it remains susceptible when replicating. It is possible that cancers that are caused by EBV might be treated by deliberately causing the virus to replicate and thus allowing our normal defence mechanisms to attack the cancer cells.\n\nThe proposed project aims to dissect the mechanism of action of a key viral protein that is responsible for starting viral replication. The human genome project revealed that this gene, called BZLF1, is similar to a family of human genes, but it has some important differences. We have so far identified three aspects that are unique to the protein made from BZLF1 (called Zta) and we will explore these unusual features in order to ascertain their mechanisms of action. It is anticipated that this approach will identify novel targets against which therapeutic agents can be developed which will aid the future manipulation of Zta function in vivo","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0400735","grantId":"G0400735","fundValue":"299998","fundStart":"2005-09-05","fundEnd":"2008-12-04","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Alison Jane Sinclair","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sussex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
