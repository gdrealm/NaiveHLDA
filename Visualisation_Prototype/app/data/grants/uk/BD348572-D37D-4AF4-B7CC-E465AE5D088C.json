{"id":"BD348572-D37D-4AF4-B7CC-E465AE5D088C","title":"Vietnamese Phrase Structure (monograph)","abstractText":"There are approximately 80 million speakers of Vietnamese, around three million of whom live in English-speaking countries (predominantly in the US and Canada, but also in the UK). The language has more native-speakers than, for example, Cantonese, Korean or Italian, yet in spite of this it has been almost completely overlooked by Western linguistic scholarship. Since Emenau's (1951) description, only two monographs have been published in English or French, on Vietnamese grammar / Thompson (1965), and Nguyen (1997) / neither of which treats syntactic phenomena in any detail. Until recently, there have only been a handful of other journal articles making any reference to Vietnamese syntax. In short, there is a dearth of basic information about the many of the core grammatical properties of Vietnamese, in stark contrast to its better studied neighbours.\\nIn an effort to address this neglect, the VIETNAMESE GRAMMAR PROJECT was established by the applicant, at McGill University in 1997. The goals of that project were, and remain: to develop an accessible but theoretically informed, description of Vietnamese; to undertake theoretical research on specific aspects of Vietnamese grammar; and to publish linguistic resources on Vietnamese, in the form of a dedicated website. \\nIn addition to its value to theoretical linguists and those with a professional interest in South East Asian linguistics, the project aims to communicate academic interest in Vietnamese, and to generate interest and discussion in the language in the wider community, and especially to support heritage language studies and other initiatives in Vietnamese communities in English-speaking countries.\\nTo date, considerable progress has been made towards achieving those goals, and laying the groundwork for the current stage of the project. The project website / now hosted at the University of Sheffield (http://www.vietnamese-grammar.group.shef.ac.uk/index.php) / includes: (i) the framework of an ONLINE REFERENCE GRAMMAR, its structure based on a recent grammar of Cantonese (Matthews &amp; Yip 1994), with sections continuously being added and revised; (ii) a browseable CORPUS OF WRITTEN VIETNAMESE, containing around 3000 lexeme entries, organized by semantic field, with relevant sentences showing how these words are used in context); (ii) a PHONOLOGICAL DATA-BASE / currently in the preliminary stage/comprising phonological analyses and web-accessible audio recordings of minimal phonemic contrasts in the three major varieties (Northern, Central and Southern). In terms of theoretical research, a number of articles on formal aspects of Vietnamese syntax have already been published Duffield (1998, 1999, 2001, 2006, in press); two chapters of an extended monograph on Vietnamese phrase-structure (to be published by Mouton de Gruyter) have been completed, with the other chapters in development. In addition, a set of ONLINE GRAMMAR QUESTIONNAIRES, linked to the project website, have been prepared, to collect additional data for both descriptive and theoretical articles; data have already been collected from more than 60 respondents, and we are continuously adding new participants. Postgraduate students who have worked on the project thus far have developed their own analyses of aspects of Vietnamese grammar, and have incorporated Vietnamese data into their dissertation research.\\nFunding from this application will support two related goals: (1) completion of the first draft of the online reference grammar; (2) preparation of a theoretical monograph analysing the core syntax of Vietnamese in comparison to other SE Asian languages.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/G00689X/1","grantId":"AH/G00689X/1","fundValue":"31601","fundStart":"2009-02-09","fundEnd":"2009-06-08","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Nigel Gordon Duffield","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
