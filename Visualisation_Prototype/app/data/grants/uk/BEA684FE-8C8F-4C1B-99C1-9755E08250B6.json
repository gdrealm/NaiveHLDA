{"id":"BEA684FE-8C8F-4C1B-99C1-9755E08250B6","title":"Learning from others: Identifying unreliable individuals vs unreliable assertions","abstractText":"<p>By around 3 years of age, children are already learning about the world from what other people tell them. This gives them the great benefit of gaining from other people’s knowledge and experience, but at the same time puts them at risk of believing false information, since even well-intentioned speakers who intend to be informative can be mistaken. In a series of four studies, this research will examine how children aged between 3 and 5 years make sense of speakers’ inaccuracies. When do they excuse inaccuracies as due to the speaker’s particular circumstances (for example, she was wearing a blindfold when she labelled an object wrongly), and when do they take them as predictive of future unreliability?&nbsp;One possibility is that&nbsp;the more children understand about circumstantial explanations for inaccuracy, the less likely they are to treat past inaccuracy as predictive of future unreliability.&nbsp;For example, a child who understands why the blindfolded adult wrongly identified the object may appropriately believe what that adult tells her in the future when the blindfold has been removed. The findings will help us understand how children manage the risks and benefits of learning about the world from other people.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-1847","grantId":"RES-000-22-1847","fundValue":"70893","fundStart":"2006-09-01","fundEnd":"2007-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Elizabeth Joan Robinson","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
