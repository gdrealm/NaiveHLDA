{"id":"D7CCCE09-C987-4AB2-B513-BE17461647ED","title":"'Headaches among the overtones': Music in the work of Samuel Beckett","abstractText":"This research is a study of the particular musical qualities of the work of Samuel Beckett, in his early work; Beckett uses music as a comparative model for literature; specific music works and philosophical notions of music are employed as part of his exploration of the limits of language and literature. My work examines his process and its relevance to key issues in the relationships between music, language and meaning, considering the ways in which Beckett's work subsequently becomes increasingly musical in its structure and effect, finally, I will consider the consequent implications of composer who work with Beckett's text.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=113100/1","grantId":"113100/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2006-02-01","fundEnd":"2007-01-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Catherine  Laws","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Falmouth University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
