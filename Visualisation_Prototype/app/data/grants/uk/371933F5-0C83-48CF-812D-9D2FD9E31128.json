{"id":"371933F5-0C83-48CF-812D-9D2FD9E31128","title":"Genetic markers for flesh quality in farmed fish","abstractText":"Genetic markers are widely used in livestock breeding programs to select animals with superior production traits, e.g. meat quality. Fish aquaculture is a global growth industry with farmed salmon now a major UK food export. Compared with traditional livestock, fish species are relatively undomesticated and the use of genetic markers to produce superior strains for farming is in its infancy. The aim of this follow-on funding project is to strengthen a patent application for single nucleotide polymorphisms markers in Atlantic salmon that were found to be significantly associated with superior fillet yield and improved flesh quality. Studies with larger populations of fish and of the association between the genetic polymorphisms and quality traits in families of known pedigree are required for the commercial validation of the markers. The project will also screen a pipeline of other genetic markers for enhanced flesh quality and extend the approach to other farmed fish species.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/J019054/1","grantId":"BB/J019054/1","fundValue":"119976","fundStart":"2012-02-01","fundEnd":"2013-01-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Our findings have been used to develop and successfully market genetic assays to select Atlantic salmon with a higher fillet yield.

The genetic assays detect naturally occurring variations in the sequence of two genes involved with muscle accretion and breakdown. Using the assays offspring can be produced with 4% more fillet worth around ?600 per tonne at current market prices. The work done on the grant strengthened a patent application and led to an investment and the formation of a spin-out company Xelect Ltd in February 2013. The company has subsequently licensed the technology to 2 major salmon breeding companies in Europe and Chile. Commercial trials are now well underway and we anticipate marketing of high yield fish and a royalty stream from 2016. Our research has led to a commercial project which is available for licensing to improve the profitability of salmon farming. Agriculture, Food and Drink","dataset":"gtr"}
