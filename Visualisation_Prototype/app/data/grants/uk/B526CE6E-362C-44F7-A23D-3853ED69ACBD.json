Organisms that have a greater resistance to the\nconditions in biocatalysis for the synthesis of pharmaceutical compounds are needed. We want to move from a\npetrochemical based chemical and pharmaceutical synthesis to a more bio-based economy and to do this we need much\nbetter and more rapid tools for building biochemical and metabolic pathways in a new organism (chassis).\nThe proposed project will develop rapid ways of getting high level expression in any new chassis organism. The various\nsteps of enzyme expression will be dissected using our new tools and knowledge of how genes are expressed. This will\nlead to modular parts for the expression of biocatalysis genes and pathways in any new chassis. We will test this\ndevelopment pathway in some selected chassis that are examples of novel organisms more fitted to the bioprocess\nconditions for the bio-synthesis of pharmaceutical compounds.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/M005607/1","grantId":"BB/M005607/1","fundValue":"99926","fundStart":"2014-08-18","fundEnd":"2015-07-17","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"John Maxim Ward","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
