Indeed, there remain hundreds of proteins we don't know anything about - other than the gene (the DNA composition) that makes it. But having the DNA means that we literally can take one single gene into the lab, artificially put it into a cell and make that cell synthesize a large amount of its 'gene product' - the unknown protein. Then the fun begins: What is the protein? What does it do? Where is it found? Might it be altered in disease, or might it be manipulated with drugs so that it becomes a target for fighting disease? These are the questions that we want to answer in regard to a virtually unknown protein, pannexin-1 (panx1). We stumbled on panx1 18 months ago when we were looking for drugs that would block a known protein, the so-called P2X7 receptor (P2X7R), which we have studied for over a decade. The P2X7R is of much interest to basic researchers and pharmaceutical companies because it is responsible for causing the release of important inflammatory molecules (cytokines) from immune cells that have been recruited to areas of inflammation or injury, and blocking the P2X7R reduces pain caused by chronic inflammation. This has made P2X7R an attractive target for anti-inflammatory drug therapy. We found a drug that did not block the P2X7R itself but was even more effective in blocking the release of cytokines than was blocking P2X7R. It turned out that panx1 was physically associated with ('stuck to') P2X7R and was somehow turned on when P2X7R was stimulated and it was the panx1 protein that led to cytokine release. These findings made us realize we need to start working on panx1 by itself. The panx1 protein was just identified in 2003-4 and to date there have been only five publications by two different groups (other than ours) in which the functional properties of the panx1 protein alone have been studied. Panx was first found by labs who were searching the genome database for genes that might be responsible for making gap junctions, or bridges between cells. These bridges are formed by two half-junction proteins (called hemichannels) on the surface of adjoining cells fusing into a single protein that makes a physical link, or gap junction, through which intracellular constituents up to a certain size can readily cross. Initially panx1 was thought to be a new type of gap junction protein but it now seems that, although it can make true gap junctions under some circumstances, it is more likely to function as a solitary hemichannel. It is now important and timely to provide a detailed pharmacological and functional profile of this protein when it is expressed artificially so it can be studied 'in isolation' and also to see how panx1 functions in its native environment. To this end, we will use high-throughput drug screening technology to provide initial pharmacological characterization of artificially expressed panx1 and to screen for new compounds that activate or block panx1. We will then examine functional properties of the artificial panx1 hemichannel using high-resolution biophysical techniques (called patch-clamp techniques that can measure the tiny electric currents which flow when one or more ion channel opens) and see exactly how the compounds identified in our high throughput screen are acting. We do this by using molecular biology techniques to change one amino acid at a time in the panx1 protein and then see how this changes the function of the panx1 ion channel and its response to drugs. We will also use antibody technology to see where exactly where native panx1 protein is located in immune cells. Finally, using information obtained from this, we will make patch-clamp recordings from immune cells which normally express panx1 in order to find out how native panx1 acts as to alter immune cell function.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F018770/1","grantId":"BB/F018770/1","fundValue":"350764","fundStart":"2008-08-01","fundEnd":"2011-07-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  They have not been used according to my knowledge Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology Cultural","person":"Alexej  Verkhratsky","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":" We decsribied some mechanisms of ion movements upon stimulation of P2X receptors.
