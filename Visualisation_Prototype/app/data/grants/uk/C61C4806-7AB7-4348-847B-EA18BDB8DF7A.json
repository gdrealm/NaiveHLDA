{"id":"C61C4806-7AB7-4348-847B-EA18BDB8DF7A","title":"The University of Birmingham - Equipment Account","abstractText":"This proposal is to bid for capital support for the creation of a Centre for Cryogenic Energy Storage at the University of Birmingham in collaboration with the University of Hull and a range of industrial partners. Such a Centre is essential for the accelerated development of a technology which can bring multiple energy system benefits and economic value to the UK. A pilot-plant has been shown to function as intended, but to be a viable technology for commercialisation, a research effort is needed to improve the efficiency of the system, to develop novel materials with lower costs and longer life-times, and to assess, model and simulate its dynamic performance characteristics as a grid-scale technology. \nInvestment in equipment and a specialist dedicated lab facility at Birmingham would create an internationally-renowned centre keeping the UK at the leading edge of cryogenic energy storage (CES) R&amp;D. The Centre's approach will cover the full CES system, from materials to devices / components and applications, and critically to key aspects of systems integration, control and optimisation. The work of the Centre will transfer directly to full-demonstration through partnerships with industry. Bringing this focus on a viable technology gives it the best opportunity for success.\nThe University of Birmingham has grown an exceptionally strong research community around closely related topics with in excess of &pound;20m research income across energy related areas over the last five years. The University is internationally renowned in the areas of hydrogen storage and applications, road and rail transport, and smart grid analysis drawing on the disciplines of materials science, metallurgy, mechanical engineering, chemical &amp; process engineering, and electrical engineering. With the arrival of a new Professor with an international reputation in energy storage, the University will build on its existing capability to deliver a world-leading CES centre which can pave the way for indusry in the UK.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/L017725/1","grantId":"EP/L017725/1","fundValue":"6727390","fundStart":"2013-12-19","fundEnd":"2023-12-18","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Tim  SoftleyMalcolm Colin  Press","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
