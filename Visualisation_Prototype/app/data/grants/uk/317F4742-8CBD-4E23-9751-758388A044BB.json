These bodies are collectively called 'planetesimals', and are of great interest to planetary scientists because they have remained unchanged for most of the 4,500 million year history of the solar system. Thus, they can tell us much about how it formed and developed. This research project is concerned with planetesimals that contained liquid water, probably for a brief period soon after their formation. Pieces of these planetesimals have fallen to Earth as meteorites called 'carbonaceous chondrites', which are highly valued by scientists because their chemical compositions indicate that they are least altered rocks available for study. However, despite their very primitive chemistry, the carbonaceous chondrites are made mainly of minerals that were formed by water reacting with their parent planetesimal, and this process of aqueous alteration would be expected to have also modified the chemical composition of the rock. This contradiction between a primitive chemistry and secondary mineralogy can only be explained if water within the planetesimal was static. However, recent computer simulations of planetesimal evolution consistently predict that only the smallest bodies could have contained static water and in most it must have flowed through the rocks, modifying their chemical compositions along its path. In this research programme we will test the assumptions and predictions of these models by obtaining new information on the behavior and history of water within planetesimals using one group of carbonaceous chondrites called the CMs. These meteorites contain small crystals of minerals called carbonates that crystallized from the water. By examining the compositions, internal structures and distributions of carbonate crystals using a range of microscope-based techniques, we will address the following questions: Was the water stationary or did it flow in the same way that hot water moves through rocks on Earth? Did the water exist for only a brief period in a small body or was it present for millions of years within a larger planetesimal? Did planetesimal interiors contain water or was it present only close to their surface? Results of this research will increase our understanding of how planetesimals formed and evolved and will enable us and other scientists to assess and potentially modify the computer models of planetesimal interiors. Ultimately this work is significant for our understanding of the early history of the solar system but also of the present-day composition and internal structure of comets and asteroids. These bodies are currently the focus of a great deal of international research activity, having been visited recently by several space probes, and are targets for future unmanned and possibly manned exploration.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/G001693/1","grantId":"ST/G001693/1","fundValue":"351840","fundStart":"2009-11-16","fundEnd":"2012-11-15","funder":"STFC","impactText":"  We have also shared our findings with the general public by giving lectures at the Hunterian Museum in Glasgow, holding workshops in Scottish science centers, and even by setting up a stall in a Glasgow shopping center.

The focus of our work was on planetesimals that contained liquid water, pieces of which have fallen to Earth as carbonaceous chondrite meteorites. Reaction of water with these planetesimals shortly after the birth of the solar system formed minerals called carbonates, and by analysing the internal structure, distribution and chemical composition of these minerals we have sought to answer the following questions: Was the water stationary or did it flow in the same way that hot water moves through rocks on Earth? Did the water exist for only a brief period in a small body or was it present for millions of years within a larger planetesimal? Did planetesimal interiors contain water or was it present only close to their surface?\n\nThis research programme has provided much new information on when and how the water reacted with planetesimal interiors. The results have enabled us and other planetary scientists to develop new models for their evolution, and to propose novel hypotheses to be tested by the next generation of spacecraft that will study and sample primitive asteroids.\n\nWe have demonstrated that water did not react with planetesimal interiors in one brief event, but rather over several longer episodes between which the abundance and type of chemical elements in the water changed significantly. We have been able to determine very precisely when the water first appeared, and using newly discovered features called veins, we have demonstrated that the water flowed through the rock in much the same was as it does on Earth. By developing a new technique called ‘calcite twin stress analysis’ we found that during or soon after the time that water was present, the planetesimal interiors were compressed by high pressures caused by the impact of one or meteorites on the outer surface of the planetesimal. We have been able to measure quantify these pressures, and determine the direction in which they moved through the planetesimal. Our finds are important to others in the academic community who seek to understand the early evolution and internal structure of asteroids. They are also of particular significance to international groups who are planning missions to return samples of primitive asteroids. These missions are under the auspices of the US and Japanese space agencies and interpretation of results will rely heavily on prior understanding of the carbonaceous chondrite meteorites.
