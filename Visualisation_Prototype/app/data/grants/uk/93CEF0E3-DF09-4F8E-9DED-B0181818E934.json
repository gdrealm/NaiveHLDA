{"id":"93CEF0E3-DF09-4F8E-9DED-B0181818E934","title":"Next Generation Components and Systems for Biomedical Imaging","abstractText":"Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a new optical bio-imaging tool which is firmly established in ophthalmology and rapidly emerging in areas such as cancer detection, wound monitoring, cardiovascular medicine and tissue engineering. The performance of OCT depends critically on the performance of the light source and the technique's penetration into the wider medical arena is being delayed by the current generation of sources. Our partnership brings together a multidisciplinary team with demonstrated expertise in the entire OCT development chain from photonic device technologists, through biomedical optics researchers, commercial OCT systems manufacturers and clinical end-users into a co-ordinated programme to address this bottleneck. We aim to develop a new generation of light sources which will achieve not only a price/performance breakthrough but also enable much greater system miniaturisation and ruggedness. The new light sources will be evaluated in an active OCT research laboratory and also offered for evaluation by our commercial partners. Next generation OCT imaging systems will be realised by developing optical components and laser systems which will redefine the state-of-the-art with regard to factors such as output power, emission band-width, tuneability of linewidth, sweep speed, and incorporate design features to simplify the OCT system and reduce cost. The research is vertically integrated from the development of new epitaxial techniques, modification of semiconductor materials, device design and fabrication technologies, development of swept laser systems, and their assessment and implementation in OCT systems studying real biological samples.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I018328/1","grantId":"EP/I018328/1","fundValue":"1048360","fundStart":"2011-07-01","fundEnd":"2015-06-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Richard Andrew Hogg","coPersons":["Stephen  Matcher","Keith David  Hunter","Kristian Michael Groom"],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
