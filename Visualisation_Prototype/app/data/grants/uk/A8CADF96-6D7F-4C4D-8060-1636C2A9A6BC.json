We are also developing new ideas for how these methods can be used to further enhance our knowledge on phosphorus cycling. Additionally, we are developing a review paper on the fundamentals of phosphorus chemistry in soils. We are also carrying out some collaborative research between the Institutes involved in this Partnering Award involving the sharing of samples and analysis techniques. Others may be able to adopt the methods we are developing, and some of our research will hopefully mean we have a better understanding of phosphorus cycling which will inform its better and more sustainable use in agriculture in the future.
