The main areas of statistical methodology development are: correlated classifications and missing data in multilevel models.

Methodological research was in three areas: handling missing data in multilevel models; extending multilevel models to allow for dependencies between units at any given level (e.g. between schools who share catchment areas); and methods for studying influences of individuals on other individuals within a social group. A range of software tools were written to make these and other methodological developments accessible to researchers.\n\nThe findings of one research project indicate that choosing a child’s school based on government league tables is inadvisable because the tables ignore the uncertainty that arises from predicting a school’s future performance based on past performance. Another project, using data from half a million English children, measured the relative contributions of school, neighbourhood, family and child characteristics on children’s educational progress from age 11 to 16. Counter to previous research findings, the project showed that approximately half of the variability in progress that standard approaches would attribute to students actually arises from family influences, while a non-trivial proportion of the variability that would usually be attributed to schools is better described as neighbourhood variability. SCIENTIFIC IMPACT\n\nThe project has made significant scientific contributions to the development and application of statistical methods for the analysis of complex social processes, the development of user-friendly software to make advanced statistical methods accessible to social researchers, and the provision of face-to-face and online training. Impacts include:\nMethods and software\n- Further enhancements to the MLwiN software (e.g. to improve data entry and efficiency of model estimation). 2630 users have taken advantage of the free UK academic download since the start of LEMMA 2. \n- Development of multiple-imputation methods for multilevel data structures which can handle missing data on mixtures of continuous and discrete variables defined at different levels, and the associated free REALCOM-Impute software. \n- Development of a new Stata command, runmlwin. \n- Development of the beta version of the Stat-JR software system which allows model fitting in multiple software packages through a common interface, allows greater flexibility for estimation of new models, and improves computational efficiency of existing methods. \n- A multilevel longitudinal structural equation model for estimation of reciprocal effects among individuals in a social group.\nApplied research\n- Significant contribution to UK and international debates on the use of school league tables for evaluating school performance and informing parental choice, and on the relative effects of school, area and family on pupil progress.\n- Further development of a new approach for modelling trends in social segregation.\nTraining\n- Delivery of 25 days of training, including two 3-day intensive research workshops which supported researchers in analysing their own data. We also contributed to workshops in Belfast, Edinburgh and London.\n- Further development of the LEMMA Virtual Learning Environment which now has 8519 registered users. \n- Provision of support and materials to enable other academics to run their own courses.\n\nECONOMIC/SOCIETAL IMPACT\n\nMethods, software and training resources developed under LEMMA have achieved economic and societal impacts through use by academics engaged in policy research and in research commissioned by government and third sector organisations. Work on league tables has raised awareness of their limitations for measuring institutional performance. More specifically:\n- Research on league tables has encouraged debate on their appropriateness for assessing performances of schools and other institutions, and their usefulness for informing parental choice. Goldstein is co-author of a major British Academy policy report on league tables in the public sector (Foley and Goldstein 2012). The research has also contributed to debates in Australia and New Zealand (and discussions with the main teaching union in NZ). \n\n- MLwiN has been used in survey methods research, including ESRC Survey Design and Measurement Initiative projects on nonresponse (G. Durrant with Steele, J. Bynner with Goldstein, and P. Lynn) and interviewer effects (P. Sturgis). This work has involved Natcen and ONS and has informed survey practice on strategies for reducing nonresponse and interviewer bias. MLwiN is also widely used in research on educational assessment conducted for assessment agencies and examination boards (e.g. AQA and QCA). MLwiN and REALCOM-impute were used in analysis of a longitudinal survey of prisoners for the Ministry of Justice (I. Brunton-Smith, Surrey).\n\n- Since the project start, MLwiN has been purchased by 572 non-academics. New users include the Scottish Government, Surrey Country Council, Matrix Knowledge Group, Statistics Norway, UNESCO Chile and Philips Electronics. Please see the End of Award Report (3b) for other examples of non-academic use of MLwiN. REALCOM-Impute and runmlwin are free to all.\n\n- The LEMMA VLE provides free training to all, reducing R&amp;D and training costs for academics and non-academics alike. Uptake among non-academics has been high (1258 users, 15% of total). Education,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice","dataset":"gtr"}
