OMII-UK is an expansion of the Open Middleware Infrastructure Institute (OMII) that was originally established as a 3 year project in Southampton in January 2004. In its first 2 years the OMII has developed a robust software engineering process leading to multiple releases of an easy to install software distribution, and has established a 'managed programme' of software development. From its 3rd year OMII is expanding with the addition of Manchester (myGrid) and Edinburgh (OGSA-DAI) to form OMII-UK, bringing established user communities / myGrid in life sciences, OGSA-DAI for data-intensive users. This project supports the OMII-UK Centre at Southampton as it expands to support OMII-UK in 2006 and continues for a further 3 years to 2009, and includes the managed programme.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D076617/1","grantId":"EP/D076617/1","fundValue":"6778370","fundStart":"2006-07-01","fundEnd":"2010-12-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"David  De Roure","coPersons":["Peter  Henderson","Wendy  Hall"],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
