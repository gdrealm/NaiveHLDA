These include volunteering to make communities better places. A core idea in recent thinking in behavioural economics and the study of collective action is that the way information is presented to citizens matters to their willingness to donate their time. This can include who makes the request, what information there is about what other people do, and what feedback people get about their volunteering and the activities of others.</p>\n\n<p>The research is particularly interested in whether recommendations from prominent people, such as those in the community sector and politicians, can help promote civic action. The researchers want to know whether varying the form of feedback to citizens matters. Using randomized controlled trials, the researchers will investigate contributions to time-banks and student volunteering.</p>\n\n<p>The project will first recruit new volunteers and vary randomly the kind of request. Once participants start to volunteer, it will feed back information about how well they are doing in different ways to find out the impact on their participation and volunteering in local communities.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J012424/1","grantId":"ES/J012424/1","fundValue":"401310","fundStart":"2013-01-07","fundEnd":"2015-12-06","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter  John","coPersons":["Oliver  James","Elizabeth  Richardson","Gerry  Stoker"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
