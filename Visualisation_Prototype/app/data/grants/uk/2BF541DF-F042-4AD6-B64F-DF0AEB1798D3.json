Allergy is caused by the presence of a specific antibody in the body, named IgE. The current research looks at ways in which the body makes this substance and how to switch it off. In asthma, one of the commonest allergic conditions, previous evidence has suggested that inflammation in the bronchial tubes in the lungs of patients play an essential role in perpetuating and causing severe disease. The proposed research analyses the control for the production of a number of substances, named cytokines, which are believed to be central to orchestrating bronchial inflammation in asthma. The results of the proposed work may provide new ideas on how to develop strategies for treatment of this common condition. Tak Lee (lead applicant) is the National Asthma Campaign Professor. The Charity can therefore help to publicize, in conjunction with the MRC, discoveries originating from the proposed research to its extensive lay membership through its news letters and to the wider public via its well established contacts in the media, whenever appropriate.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G9805965","grantId":"G9805965","fundValue":"303965","fundStart":"1998-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-11-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Tak  Lee","coPersons":["Brian John Sutton","Stephen R Durham","Hannah Jane Gould","James  McDonnell"],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
