{"id":"C32EF148-9131-4B99-9820-C722FB885E2A","title":"The Victorian Press and the Fairy Tale","abstractText":"The nineteenth century saw major developments in the fairy tale as a popular genre; it also witnessed dramatic changes in the cost and accessibility of print, resulting in an explosion of newspapers and magazines. The Victorian Press and the Fairy Tale will be the first book to focus on that dynamic relationship, arguing that the supposed 'golden age' of fairy tale and fantasy was intimately shaped by that magazine culture. My book will reveal that periodicals played a seminal role in establishing a canon of classic fairy tales, in spreading folktale scholarship, and in politicising and fostering new experiments with the genre. Whether used to grapple with the implications of Darwinism, to imagine a socialist utopia, or to engage with new aesthetic movements and strategies, the fairy tale played a central role in Victorian cultural debates. From Charles Kingsley to Keir Hardie, children's monthlies and socialist newspapers to avant-garde magazines, my book reveals the true complexity of that role, uncovering the fairy tale's appropriation for (and by) a range of forgotten readerships. This project uses publishing history to write a new history of the Victorian fairy tale, and challenges some key assumptions made in existing work on the genre. \\n\\n \\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/F003285/1","grantId":"AH/F003285/1","fundValue":"25981","fundStart":"2007-09-24","fundEnd":"2008-01-23","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  My book has been referenced by experts in recent scholarly literature on the fairy tale and Victorian literature and is widely stocked in libraries (particularly in the USA). It has also been cited in media debates over the origins of fairy tale in the USA UK, and Finland and has been read by general readers. It won an international award (The Mythopoeic Scholarship Award 2011) which draws together mainstream audiences for fantasy as well as scholars in this field. The paperback edition of 2012 was commissioned as a result of the book's popular sales as well as its very positive reviews, international award and other award nominations. The preface to the paperback edition references recent media debates over the fairy tale, and has brought the book to a much larger numbers of general readers.

In fact, as I argue in my book, it ensured the genre's popularity, bringing literary tales and folklore to the first mass readerships. Exploring penny weeklies, adult and children's monthlies, little magazines and the labour press, my study was the first to combine media and fairy tale history. Bringing reading communities back into focus, it recovered ingenious political uses of the fairy tale: in debates over socialism, evolution and race, and in the context of women's rights, decadence and gay culture. My research has already been picked up on by the media in popular debates over the origins of fairy tales; it has been referenced by key scholars in the field, and I can foresee my methodological use of fairy tale and media history offering valuable insights into fairy tales in other national contexts. I indicate these possible ways forward in the new preface to the paperback edition of my book (2012). Creative Economy,Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections","dataset":"gtr"}
