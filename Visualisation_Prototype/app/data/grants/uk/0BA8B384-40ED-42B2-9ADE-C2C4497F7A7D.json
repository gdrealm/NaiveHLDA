In the past decade they have become the standard technology for studying gene expression differences between different experimental conditions, for example between individuals suffering from certain diseases and unaffected individuals. The latest generation of Affymetrix microarrays have increased the resolution of genomic expression detection from the gene level down to the exon level, enabling measurement of different splice variants. Currently there are very few tools to take advantage of the additional information contained within these Exon arrays. The aim of this project is to develop powerful and robust methods for Exon array analysis including alternative splice detection and gene expression analyses. The software will be made available for researchers to download and use on their own sytem. In addition, data sets from microarray experiments can be very large and complex. The use of such high-throughput technology brings challenges for researchers in terms of data analysis and storage. Many biologists do not have direct collaboration with statisticians and bioinformaticians who are able to advise on and carry out data analysis. Thus there is a need for readily available analysis tools, in a form accessible to the biological community. Therefore this project also aims to present the developed analysis methods in a user friendly analysis environment, along with technical support and training software. The work will build on an existing resource called EMAAS, created for microarray data analysis and management which has been developed by the Bioinformatics Support Service at Imperial College. This utilises Grid clusters of computers which allows very fast data analysis, accessed via a user-friendly web interface.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/G000352/1","grantId":"BB/G000352/1","fundValue":"94649","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-10-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Alexandra  Lewin","coPersons":["Sarah Anne Butcher"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":" Two novel analysis methods were produced: one for exploiting data from Affymetrix Gene Expression Microarrays, one for high-throughput sequencing of RNA (known as RNA-seq).
