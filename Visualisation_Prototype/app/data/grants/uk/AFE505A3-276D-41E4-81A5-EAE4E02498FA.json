Tooth restoration may be performed directly in the mouth or indirectly by cementing a pre-fabricated restoration to the prepared tooth. Indirect techniques offer the dental operator greater control over the shape and form of the ultimate restoration and of the materials currently available, dental ceramics are most equipped to mimic tooth structure in shade, translucency and lustre. However, the major criticism levelled at dental ceramic restorations is their susceptibility to fracture in service and despite extensive engineering to increase the strength of these materials the data from clinical studies suggest the annual failure rate to be approximately 3-5%. Failure of dental restorations has high cost implications to both the patient and the relevant health authority both in terms of the cost of the revision dentistry and in terms of time required to attend appointments.Dental practitioners have a choice of different classes of cement materials available to use to secure dental ceramic restorations in the mouth. Of these, resin-based cements, which can adhesively bond to both the tooth and some dental ceramic materials, have been shown to reduce likelihood of fracture of the ceramic restoration in service. It is understood that the improved performance with these materials occurs because the resin-based cement interacts with the flaws on the surface of the ceramic from which a crack may propagate. However, the strengthening mechanism(s) is poorly understood thereby preventing the optimisation of the clinical techniques and the cementation materials required to exploit the available reinforcement. The proposed research aims to carefully characterise the strengthening mechanism and to begin to identify the material characteristics of the resin-based cement that are required to provide the most significant and durable reinforcement of dental ceramic restorations. Using these learnings, further efforts will be made to develop novel resin-coatings and processing routes that strengthen the dental ceramic and that may be applied prior to cementation. It is hoped that the outcomes of this study will be readily translatable into the provision of clinical protocols and development of optimised and/or novel materials that will reduce the incidence of premature fracture of dental ceramic restorations in service. The research is performed in close conjunction with clinical experts, industrial collaborators and international academic partners.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H028617/1","grantId":"EP/H028617/1","fundValue":"98492","fundStart":"2011-01-05","fundEnd":"2012-01-04","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Owen  Addison","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":" When a tooth is damaged the missing structure is routinely replaced to prevent pain, sensitivity and infection, in addition to restoring function and aesthetics. The tooth restoration may be performed directly in the mouth or indirectly by cementing a pre-fabricated prosthesis (sometimes known as a crown or a cap) to the prepared tooth structure. Indirect techniques offer the dentist the greatest control over the contour and aesthetics of the restoration and of the materials we have available today, ceramics are most equipped to mimic tooth structure in form, shade, translucency and luster. The major criticism leveled at dental ceramic restorations is their susceptibility to fracture in service which we know is as a consequence of the extension of pre-existing defects inherent to the material or introduced in processing. Although dental ceramic materials have been extensively developed to result in materials with flexure strengths up to 1200 MPa, the retrospective clinical data reporting their suggests the annual failure rates remain in the region of 3-5%. Clinical studies have demonstrated that such restorations are more resistant to fracture when they are cemented to the prepared tooth structure with adhesive (glue-like) materials. This project looked at into the mechanisms which underpinning resin reinforcement of dental ceramics and examined steps that could be taken to exploit the resin strengthening potential. \n\n\n\nThe investigation used well accepted experimental techniques involving the use of model systems of large numbers of nominally identical test specimens which fail during strength testing in the same mode as is observed clinically but provide robust data for statistical analyses. We also used fractography (the science of imaging fractured ceramics and determining the location of the critical flaw and the failure mode) extensively using protocols of the National Institute of Standards and Technology in the USA. Significant results include: (i) residual thermal stress gradients induced during ceramic sintering can cause test specimen deformation altering the measured strength. We demonstrate for feldspathic dental ceramics that the firing orientation during sintering which is very rarely reported in the literature can have a significant impact on the strength data and confounding its interpretation. (ii) for a model glass-ceramic (lithium disilicate) we demonstrate that pre-cementation surface treatments such as acid-etching or particle air abrasion modify transient and residual stress states and the magnitude of strengthening conferred by the resin cement (iii) reinforcement of recent evidence demonstrating a linear association of the magnitude of strengthening conferred by the resin cement with its elastic constants however a non-linear association with the stress induced on the ceramic due to the shrinkage of the resin-based cement (indirectly measured by the characterizing ceramic sample deformation) (iv) extensive fractographic examination &gt;1000 test specimens demonstrated that porosity between the resin and the ceramic is the always the crack origin. Elimination of the porosity in the area of highest stress results in radial transportation of the crack origin and can result in a modification of the statistical distribution of the strength data. (v) Data from fatigues studies corresponds with stress-corrosion theory for samples manufactured in clinically realistic environments. Elimination of water in the cementation environment (which may be achievable as a laboratory step) dramatically modifies the fatigue data with further strengthening observed at low strains. Cumulatively this programme has advanced our understanding of the mechanism underpinning the strengthening of dental ceramics by resin-cements and provided insight into a number of areas where the strengthening effect can be further exploited. A number of further manuscripts are in preparation to disseminate these findings. The findings are directly relevant to clinicians and modification to current practice can be made immediately based on findings from this project. Efforts are now being made to work towards a commercial resin-based composite adhesive with mechanical properties optimized to exploit ceramic strengthening Healthcare","dataset":"gtr"}
