First a clinic trial was run in India and results from this have been presented to farmers in India and the UK in talks as part of knowledge exchange on management of footrot in sheep.\nSecond an MSc student that we met on our visit to India discussed the possibility of a PhD at Warwick. He applied to our Chancellor's scholarship award scheme and was successful. He si currently in the final year of his PhD.

Footrot is though to contribute to poor fertility because sheep are in poor body condition. Treatment with antibiotics led to recovery from lameness, even in sheep that had been lame for 2 years. \nCollaboration through this partnering award led to an Indian veterinary scientist taking a PhD at Warwick. By raising the profile of the research in India there have been collaborations between Srinagar, India, Warwick and Monash, Australia on the pathogen that causes footrot in sheep.
