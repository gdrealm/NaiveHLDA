{"id":"22825DD1-3705-4C00-A8C5-5D1633EFE865","title":"Corpus of the Greek and Latin Inscriptions of Ankara (Turkey) to AD 300","abstractText":"Ancient Ancyra, the Roman and Byzantine precursor of Ankara, the capital of modern Turkey, was one of the most important cities of the Roman East. This research is designed to produce the first volume of a comprehensive and authoritative edition of all the Greek and Latin inscriptions of the city, around 500 in all, combined with other evidence for Ankara's history in the first millennium AD. These texts include the most famous of all Roman inscriptions, the Res Gestae (achievements) of the first emperor, Augustus, which is one of the foundation stones for modern study of the Roman empire. There are many other important groups of texts from Ankara, which document its transformation from a tribal centre of the Galatians, a Celtic people, into a monumental Roman city during the second and third centuries AD. Numerous inscriptions for Roman soldiers who were stationed in Ankara or who passed through the city are an invaluable source of information for Roman campaigns in the East. Other texts document the institutions of the city and the activities of members of the Roman and local governing elites. The inscriptions illustrate the use of both Latin and Greek, including the development of the Greek language in central Anatolia over a period of a thousand years.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/F004567/1","grantId":"AH/F004567/1","fundValue":"34797","fundStart":"2008-02-01","fundEnd":"2008-05-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Stephen  Mitchell","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Exeter","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
