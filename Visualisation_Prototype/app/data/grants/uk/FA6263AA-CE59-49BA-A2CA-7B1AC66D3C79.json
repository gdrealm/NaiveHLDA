{"id":"FA6263AA-CE59-49BA-A2CA-7B1AC66D3C79","title":"South Asian Precipitation: A Seamless Assessment: SAPRISE","abstractText":"The Indian summer monsoon provides about 80% of annual rainfall to around a billion people in South Asia. Variations in its timing, intensity and duration have a dramatic impact on society. The weather and climate in the South Asian region is influenced by the weather and climate in the Indian and remote ocean basins via what are known as teleconnections (remote connections). Teleconnections emerge from phenomena such as El Nino - a kind of gigantic ocean weather system that occurs every 2-8 years in the tropical Pacific. Tiny aerosol particles are also key component of the South Asian atmosphere due to the prevalence of cooking fires over the Indo-Gangetic Plain and dust blown from local and remote deserts. \n\nIt remains a considerable challenge to predict seasonal, decadal and longer-term changes in the South Asian monsoon. This proposal brings together UK and Indian scientists to make progress in understanding what affects the South Asian monsoon on different time scales. Key tools are new climate models that simulate the interactions between the different teleconnections and aerosols and new observations, especially those from satellites. The ultimate goal of the project is to improve predictive capability and to therefore potentially improve the lives of those people affected by monsoon rains.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/I022841/1","grantId":"NE/I022841/1","fundValue":"565190","fundStart":"2012-02-27","fundEnd":"2015-07-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Matthew  Collins","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Exeter","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
