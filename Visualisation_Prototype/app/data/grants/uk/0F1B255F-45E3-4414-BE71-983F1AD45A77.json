{"id":"0F1B255F-45E3-4414-BE71-983F1AD45A77","title":"The meanings of spatialization in popular music recordings","abstractText":"The underlying aim of this project is to understand why stereo works in popular music recordings. In other words, why is the stereo experience a better one than the mono experience? In order to address this aim, the project will focus on a single, key, aspect of the use of stereo manipulation, i.e. that of spaces apparent in recordings. These spaces are of three distinct types. First, there is the illusion of a particular kind of location that the music is occupying - is it a private space or a public space? Of what kind? To what purpose? Secondly, there is the sense that the entire stereo space is not necessarly in use constantly - what happens when one channel is stronger than the other, or when a particularly prominent timbre drops out, for instance? Thirdly, there is the sense that we can be enveloped by this space created by the music; we can be overwhelmed by it. What's happening here?\\n\\nIn order to answer these questions, the project will undertake a large amount of analysis of recorded music from the late 1960s to the present, across a range of genres, paying a certain amount of attention to correlations between spatial location and other features of the music (melody, lyrics, instrumentation...). The theoretical aspect of the project (i.e. what underlies the way we interpret the analyses) is grounded in three aspects of contemporary cultural theory: ecological psychology as developed for music by Eric Clarke; feminist theory concerning public and private spaces; and Lacanian psychoanalysis in relation to how 'the real' impacts the reality we perceive by means of symbolic languages.\\n\\nThe work will result in a series of analyses and analytically-informed discussions which will be made available as refereed journal articles and conference presentations in the usual way. The project includes meetings with others working in the area of popular music analysis, to help ensure the best possible academic reception for the project's findings.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/E006752/1","grantId":"AH/E006752/1","fundValue":"160423","fundStart":"2008-01-01","fundEnd":"2009-11-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Allan Frederick  Moore","coPersons":["Patricia Lynne Schmidt"],"organisation":"University of Surrey","findingsText":" Project develops a methodology for understanding the aesthetic effect of the creation of virtual spaces in popular song recordings of all types.
