This C3 approach will look at a different ways in which the ANTs can develop a sustainable research community committed to multidisciplinary collaboration. C3 will be delivered by:- Creating a clear visual identity and web presence for the Bridging ANTs community;- Running facilitated flagship workshop meetings where researchers can actively network to kick start collaborations;- Using Cranfield's Centre for Competitive Creative Design (C4D) to bring together designers and technologists in partnership, to develop novel ways to deliver and communicate technological solutions from a design perspective;- Building an electronic community to store and exchange nanotechnology-related-information. This would also act as one of the routes to interact with the wider community including industry and the general public;- Establishing informal 'coffee mornings' type forums to provide a time and place for researchers to meet on a regular basis to exchange ideas and develop collaborations;- Using artists in residence, art installations and informal discussion meetings and exhibitions to stimulate the exchange of ideas;- Creating industrial collaborative partnerships to support industry and drive applied multidisciplinary/cross-sector collaborative research forward; - Developing a nano-engagement toolkit for lectures and outreach activities that can be used to support and promote applied nanotechnology within and outside of Cranfield;- Using Collaborative Bridging Awards to support collaborative exploratory projects with a view to develop a sustainable collaboration framework through securing further project funding.Throughout the Bridging ANTs project, the ethos of C3 coupled with design and communication will be firmly placed at the heart of activities to ensure successful outcomes.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G069913/1","grantId":"EP/G069913/1","fundValue":"496797","fundStart":"2009-10-01","fundEnd":"2013-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The guiding principles developed to encourage collaboration are being used by the PI in developing collaborations within their organisation and also with external clients. This is occurring both at an informal level in the development of new collaborations as well as in formal collaborative projects with partners in the UK, EU and worldwide. \nOutputs from the various feasibility projects have fed into follow-on grants that may in time have an economic impact.

As such there were no specific research outcomes and where research was undertaken it took the form of small collaborative grants designed to demonstrate feasibility with a view to producing more fully formed research proposals for submission to funders. \nThe main discoveries from this work were, therefore, not scientific in nature but more aligned with societal/academic networking. From this perspective the most pertinent discovery was that effective collaboration stems from regular personal contact, a shared set of personal beliefs and working practices, and the minimisation of institutional barriers to collaborative work. Where such behaviour can be fostered, effective collaboration may flourish. \nThrough the support of a number of feasibility studies the Bridging ANTS project was able, bring together new partnerships which led to new funding bids in excess of ?10m. The rules for engagement are not restricted to academic environments and can be applied to all arenas where people could interact in a collaborative manner. The results of this project were primarily exploited through targeted proposals across a range of funding streams.
