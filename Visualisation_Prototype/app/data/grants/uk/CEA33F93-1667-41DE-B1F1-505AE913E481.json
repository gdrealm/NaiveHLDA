{"id":"CEA33F93-1667-41DE-B1F1-505AE913E481","title":"Deciphering mycolic acid transport in Mycobacterium tuberculosis","abstractText":"Tuberculosis is a global health problem, further compounded due to the rise of multi-drug resistance. The causative bacterium, Mycobacterium tuberculosis has a waxy, protective cell wall which is rich in lipids. One such 'building block' of the cell wall is a group of fatty acids termed mycolic acids. While we know how mycolic acids are made, not much is known about how they are transported to the outside of the cell. This study aims to decipher mycolic acid transport processes by using an array of molecular tools that will identify genes responsible for mycolic acid transport. As mycolic acids are essential for the survival of M. tuberculosis, genes identified in this study have potential to be targeted for drug development. Additionally, as mycolic acids are also required for virulence, these studies will, indirectly, also have implications for our understanding of how M. tuberculosis causes disease.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/K00042X/1","grantId":"MR/K00042X/1","fundValue":"362814","fundStart":"2013-09-30","fundEnd":"2016-09-29","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Apoorva  Bhatt","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
