{"id":"F7B3E96F-EEB3-4AFB-ACBB-92934DB92526","title":"Selection, perception and action","abstractText":"Disorders of perception and action occur in a wide range of neurological disorders, from stroke and closed head injury through to degenerative diseases such as Parkinson s and Alzheimer s. To understand the nature of the problems suffered by such patients, we need to develop greater knowledge of the functional and neural processes that govern perception, attention and action. This is the broad aim of this Co-operative Group. The group links researchers concerned with basic processes in perception (audition, vision, touch), with researchers working on attention and motor control. To develop an understanding at both a functional and a neural level, we will use a range of research techniques stemming from psychophysical studies of normal observers, through to studies that measure neural processing on-line (event-related brain potentials, functional brain imaging, trans-cranial magnetic stimulation), and neuropsychological studies of patients with problems in perception, attention and action. By linking across these different research techniques, we aim to develop a detailed understanding of how sensory and attentional processes guide action, and, in turn, how action influences perception. The results will be simulated in explicit computational models. We will use any advances in basic scientific knowledge to develop theoretically-informed rehabilitation techniques for neuropsychological patients.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G9806428","grantId":"G9806428","fundValue":"618960","fundStart":"1999-02-01","fundEnd":"2010-07-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Glyn  Humphreys","coPersons":["Michael  Harris","Mark Andrew Georgeson","Brian  Roberts","Andrew John Schofield","Dietmar  Heinke","Peter  Praamstra","Antje S  Meyer","Alan  Wing","M.
