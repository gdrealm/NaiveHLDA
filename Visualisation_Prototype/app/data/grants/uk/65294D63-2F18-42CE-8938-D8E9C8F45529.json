However, this simple categorisation does not necessarily reflect the underlying psychological characteristics of individuals who commit sexual offences. It has been hypothesised that individuals who perpetrate rape of woman have high psychopathic traits whereas many, but not all, of those who offend against children have strong paedophilic tendencies. Moreover, it has been postulated that sexual offenders with high psychopathic traits may have emotional deficits relating to fear whereas paedophilic tendencies maybe associated with social anxiety problems. However, much of the current theorizing is based on data derived from self-report measures which suffer from a lack of objectivity.</p>\n\n<p>This project aims to address this problem by using experimental techniques to explore the cognitive profiles of offenders who have committed different types of sexual crime. The work will focus on assessing whether</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>the ability to recognise fearful facial expressions is specifically impaired in those who perpetrate sexual offences against women, as such deficits have been reported in diagnosed psychopaths</li>\n\n <li>those with apparent paedophilic tendencies show difficulties in disengaging attention from emotionally significant stimuli as such problems are associated with anxiety.</li>\n\n</ul>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L002337/1","grantId":"ES/L002337/1","fundValue":"302197","fundStart":"2014-01-02","fundEnd":"2017-01-01","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Ian John Mitchell","coPersons":["Pia  Rotshtein","Anthony  Beech"],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":" not applicable this year not applicable this year Government, Democracy and Justice","dataset":"gtr"}
