We have previously demonstrated that in rats with a complete spinal cord transection epidural electrical stimulation of segments below the level of lesion can induce stepping. In combination with daily rehabilitation stepping ability can be re-trained to become indistinguishable from non-injured animals. We have also recently observed that rehabilitation leads to increased amounts of molecules (chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans) known to be inhibitory to axonal growth and synaptic plasticity. Here, we propose to investigate whether removal of such inhibitory molecules by an enzyme (chondroitinase ABC) will enhance the positive effects of epidural stimulation and rehabilitation on functional recovery. We will use a clinically relevant model of spinal cord injury, drug delivery times and rehabilitation interventions to determine the efficacy of such combination. Recently, epidural stimulation has been demonstrated to be effective in the recovery of standing ability and voluntary movement control in a human patient with a severe cervical injury. In addition, development of chondroitinase ABC is in final pre-clinical development. The combination of these interventions could result in significant functional gains for patients with severe spinal cord injuries.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/K022911/1","grantId":"MR/K022911/1","fundValue":"275977","fundStart":"2013-06-24","fundEnd":"2016-06-23","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Ronaldo Masaharu Ichiyama","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
