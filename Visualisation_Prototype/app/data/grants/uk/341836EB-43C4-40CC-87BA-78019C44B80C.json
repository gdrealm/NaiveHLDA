Engineering resistance to disease in pigs","abstractText":"This project addresses food security and environmental sustainability by increasing production efficiency by reducing wastage due to disease and thus decreasing the carbon footprint of pork production. We will target the significant impact of influenza virus on one of our core livestock industries. Swine influenza (SIV) ranks consistently among the top 3 economic diseases affecting breeding, nursery, and finishing herds. In addition, influenza is the top zoonotic viral disease of swine. Our strategy is based on the recent validation of a novel RNA decoy approach in chickens. We now aim to use this newly developed technology to produce genetically engineered (GE) pigs expressing novel RNA molecules designed to prevent replication and propagation of SIV. We aim to mitigate or even eliminate mortality and morbidity due to SIV infection in pigs, while additionally protecting human health by reducing the zoonotic flu pandemic potential. It is the intention that this project will function as a 'prototype' study and, if successful, with further method refinement lead to development of a commercial product.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/M018385/1","grantId":"BB/M018385/1","fundValue":"122796","fundStart":"2014-11-01","fundEnd":"2016-09-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Laurence Stephen Tiley","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
