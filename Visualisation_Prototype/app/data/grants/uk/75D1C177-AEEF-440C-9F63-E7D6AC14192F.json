However, unique, distinctive, or transient aspects of a scene sometimes capture attention. For example, stray footballs that suddenly appear in our visual field seemingly pull our eyes toward them so that we can avoid injury. How does the attention system balance the need to focus on goal-directed action against the need for immediate interruption by other important events? This research examines the degree to which the deployment of gaze to transient task-irrelevant events is mandatory, and the degree to which different kinds of changes to a scene are prioritised for viewing.&nbsp;Delineating conditions under which capture does and does not occur will enable the researchers to determine the boundary conditions under which gaze can be influenced by transient changes to real-world scenes. The work considers whether a transient change to a scene must be accompanied by a new object in order for gaze to be captured, whether one's goals during scene viewing affect the degree to which scene changes capture gaze,&nbsp;and whether the difficulty of an observer's task is&nbsp;correlated with a scene change's ability to capture gaze.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2484","grantId":"RES-000-22-2484","fundValue":"61452","fundStart":"2008-06-01","fundEnd":"2009-05-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"James Robert Brockmole","coPersons":["John M.
