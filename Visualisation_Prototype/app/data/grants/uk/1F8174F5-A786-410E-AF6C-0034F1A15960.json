This book is intended to inform a public debate about children and their lives, and particularly the role of popular media in their lives. The definition of media in the research for the book is wide-ranging: not just television and video games, but also still-popular forms such as fairy tales, children's literature and traditional games. Childhood and children's culture are regularly in the forefront of debates about how society is changing - often, it is argued, for the worse (see for instance Sue Palmer's 2006 book, 'Toxic Childhood'). Certainly children's lives have changed in the last ten years, some of the most visible changes being new media technology / digital television; the internet; portable entertainment systems such as games, mobile phones, i-pods and so on. Television, the most popular medium with children for the last thirty years, is becoming less so, as a major report on the future of children's public service broadcasting, by the telecommunications regulator, Ofcom, in October 2007, demonstrated and many people are worried about this: perhaps public service broadcasting, as exemplified by the BBC's children's services, is declining. As media consumption becomes fragmented, and less easy to regulate, so public anxieties arise about how children can be protected from new harmful influences. On the other hand, some forms of children's culture - including traditional ones - seem to be triumphantly successful; the 'Harry Potter' series of books, with their multiple electronic spinoffs - films, games, toys - are an example. My proposed research, and its resultant book, intends to examine critically the view that technology has dramatically changed children's lives and to look at some of the ways in which a.) it has not and b.) at other influences on their lives. \\n\\nThe research will also explore how children can be seen as 'citizens-in the-making' in this new, media-rich environment: an environment in which interactivity and 'citizen journalism' are seen as alternative and more democratic ways of communication, and more empowering for children, than traditional print and screen-based media. The broad question is: Has childhood itself changed, thus necessitating changes in the media provided for children, or are there some enduring aspects of childhood and of its culture, that do not change but are re-invented in new forms as technologies develop?\\n\\nThe research will include a variety of methods: the traditional scholarly approach of library research, investigating academic studies on children, childhood and children's media and culture. This will include archive research into screen material, for example the film and television archives held by the British Film Institute. Hence the research will also involve watching and critically reviewing material intended for children, using a case study approach for different media forms: literature; film; television; screen adaptations; computer games and websites. It will also examine material produced BY children; new technology permits children to be their own authors and to be 'citizen journalists'. What sort of material is produced by them? Do they enjoy and benefit from reading and looking at work produced by other children? Can this replace professional forms of entertainment and information? This is a question being examined currently by a number of projects in the AHRC/BBC Knowledge Transfer programme. The research for my commissioned book will include interviews with both producers and consumers: media workers and families with children to address these issues as broadly as possible.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/G008124/1","grantId":"AH/G008124/1","fundValue":"33372","fundStart":"2009-01-26","fundEnd":"2009-05-25","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Maire J Messenger Davies","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Ulster","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
