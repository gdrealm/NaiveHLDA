Understanding the impact of criticism on groups.","abstractText":"Mass migration, global communications, and global trade have brought large-scale social groups, who previously lived relatively separate lives, into close contact.&nbsp; These social pressures require that the groups learn to engage in constructive dialogue.&nbsp; In recent years, the sensitivities involved have been made clear by high-profile cases in which instances of satire and criticism have been found deeply offensive by their targets, resulting in anger, distrust, and even violence.&nbsp; In this project, the researchers examine how groups can engage in critical dialogue while minimising the risk of conflict and misunderstanding.&nbsp; In controlled experiments, people will be presented with criticisms of one of the social groups to which they belong.&nbsp; These criticisms will be attributed either to an “ingroup” member (who belongs to the same group), or to an “outgroup” member (who does not).&nbsp; Other features will be systematically varied, for example, whether criticisms are couched in terms of behaviours (eg a national group’s invasion of another country) or traits (eg militarism), or in terms that challenge or affirm how the group sees itself.&nbsp; The aim is to determine the modes of criticism that are most successful in being taken seriously while being least likely to cause offence, defensiveness, and hostility.\n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2540","grantId":"RES-000-22-2540","fundValue":"80792","fundStart":"2008-07-01","fundEnd":"2010-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Robbie  Sutton","coPersons":["Karen Margaret Douglas"],"organisation":"University of Kent","findingsText":" Findings replicated the &quot;intergroup sensitivity effect&quot; in which audiences evaluate external critics (who do not belong to the group in question) and their comments more negatively than internal critics (who do). Participants also evaluated critics more harshly if they denied widely shared positive stereotypes (eg by saying the British are impolite) than if they affirmed negative ones (eg by saying the British are aloof). These reactions happened whether or not participants themselves belonged to the criticised group, but others were unique to participants who belong to it and thus have reason to be defensive. For example, external criticism sometimes led to &quot;retaliatory prejudice&quot;: that is, negative perceptions of the critic's social group, and to a &quot;boomerang&quot; effect, where participants were less likely than before to acknowledge their group's failings. Further experiments showed that people do not respond with indiscriminate negativity to all external critics. For example, British participants responded much more negatively to criticism by American than French people of Britain's involvement in the Iraq war, whether their criticism alleged that Britain did not do enough, or should not have been there. Results suggest that this happened because American critics were seen as especially hypocritical, rather than ungrateful or disloyal. Studies further extended previous research on the intergroup sensitivity effect by examining responses to criticism of stigmatised, deviant and victimised groups, and of social systems.
