In total, we ask for a budget of 43200 GBP to support our research programs on exoplanets,\nstar formation, and galaxy evolution. In particular, we ask for funding for the following projects:\n\n- to conduct guaranteed time observations with the new Harps-North spectrograph at the TNG in La Palma, to confirm exoplanets detected by the Kepler mission. \n- to follow-up microlensing events as part of large-scale consortia, with observations carried out at non-STFC approved telescopes in Chile and South Africa\n- to study the initial stages of star and planet formation using optical, infrared and submm/mm cameras at international facilities\n- to secure specialised data on large optical/mm telescopes to investigate the detailed properties of galaxies","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/N001478/1","grantId":"ST/N001478/1","fundValue":"25304","fundStart":"2015-10-01","fundEnd":"2017-09-30","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Alexander  Scholz","coPersons":["Andrew Collier  Cameron"],"organisation":"University of St Andrews","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
