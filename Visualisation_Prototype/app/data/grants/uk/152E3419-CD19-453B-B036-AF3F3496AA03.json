Therefore, new treatment strategies are required to reduce the damage to the heart muscle during a heart attack in order to prevent the onset of heart failure and improve health outcomes. Whether heart muscle is able to recover following a heart attack is crucially dependent on the function of its mitochondria, the powerhouse of the cells, generating the energy required for normal heart function. This research proposal investigates the role of DJ-1, a protein within the mitochondria which may provide a novel target for protecting the heart muscle during a heart attack.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/J003530/1","grantId":"MR/J003530/1","fundValue":"372797","fundStart":"2012-03-01","fundEnd":"2015-07-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Derek John  Hausenloy","coPersons":["Andrew  Hall","Derek  Yellon"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
