This product, marketed as Zocor Heart Pro, is unique among drugs licensed for sale without prescription in the UK in being intended for prevention rather than treatment, as was the first product of its kind in the world. Yet little is known about the characteristics of consumers, or would-be consumers, nor about what 'use' means in this context.</p>\n\n<p>This exploratory project aims to investigate these concerns through five key research questions:</p>\n\n<ol>\n \n\n <li>What factors shape the decision to purchase or try to purchase OTC statins?</li>\n\n <li>How do OTC statins fit in with other attempts to prevent heart troubles or preserve health?</li>\n\n <li>What does 'use' mean in this context? (how often, for how long?)</li>\n\n <li>How far do these accounts support 'self-care' and health consumer agendas? </li>\n\n <li>What are the implications for policy concerning the regulation of non-prescription drugs in the future? </li>\n</ol>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/G030693/1","grantId":"ES/G030693/1","fundValue":"80162","fundStart":"2009-03-23","fundEnd":"2011-07-22","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Catherine Marijke Will","coPersons":["Kate  Weiner"],"organisation":"University of Sussex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
