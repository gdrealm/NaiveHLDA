{"id":"C738EDEC-6EB9-425D-98DB-9A9D55ED57FD","title":"Darwinism, Degeneration and the Irish Revival","abstractText":"This project aims to examine the influence of Darwinian ideas in Ireland in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. It will not be a history of science but a consideration of the impact of evolutionary theory on Irish culture, literature and thought. Darwin's revolutionary presence in western culture needs no rehearsing. The initial traumatic impact of the idea of natural selection is well known. So too is the beguiling ease with which Darwinian ideas could be understood and assimilated, rendering evolutionary models a ready (often too-ready) source for analogy. The deployment of evolutionary theory in the widespread fears of biological and cultural degeneration from the 1890s is a case in point.Perhaps no other thinker, let alone a scientific thinker, has had so pervasive and enduring a cultural and social imprint on the last 150 years. \\n\\nYet Darwinism has rarely drawn the attention of Irish studies specialists. When Ireland is considered in relation to evolutionary theory, it has often been as its object rather than its agent. So, for instance, there has been scholarship on pseudo-Darwinian represetnations of the Irish: the simian figures caricatured in 'Punch' magazine from the 1860s. But there has been scant consideration of the indigenous impact of evolutionary theory. The idea of Ireland as a 'land of writers', coupled with the politcal strife in Ireland up until the 1980s and 90s, perhaps eschewed attention away from scientifc strains within Irish history. Both in scholarship and popular perception there has, until recently, been a neglect of the strongly scientific origins of that most seemingly unscientific moment of national self-invention, the Irish Revival. Work on Irish scientific culture by J.W. Foster and recent studies of ethnography and primitivism during the Revival are, perhaps, indications that this neglect is being rectified. This project will be a central contribution to this scholarship.\\n\\nThough its main emphasis is on literary culture, the earlier part of this proposed monograph will analyse reactions to Darwinism from press and pulpit. It will research how the three religious traditions in Ireland negotiated evolutionary theory. This research will be used to contextualise scientific strains in politic-cultural ideology and literature. Yeats, following Matthew Arnold, vaunted Ireland as the redoubt of ancient idealism, pitted against the empiricisim and materialism of 'the filthy modern tide'. An anti-modern Celticism suited the culturally nationalist agenda of Yeats, but it crumbles under historical scrutiny. The work of George Moore, J.M. Synge, A.E. and Yeats himself illustrates that the influence of Darwin is inescapable in the Irish Literary Revival, despite the anti-scientism that this Revival often seemed to embrace. We can see a Darwinian watermark in the widespread concern with degeneration in the Irish Revival and in Anglo-Irish writing more generally (Irish Gothic being a case in point), a fear heavily coloured by the decline in the political power of the Irish Ascendancy. The enthusiasm for eugenics by the elderly Yeats is a later example.\\n\\nIn brief, then, the aims and objectives of this project are to interrogate the Darwinian presence in Irish culture and, in particular, to see how it inflects the widespread concern with degeneration. In other words I want to show how Darwinism contributed in Ireland, as elsewhere, to a familiar crisis of modernity between the physical and the spiritual, fact and value. This project will recognise the international dimensions of Irish culture, even at its most ostensibly nationalist, and will highlight an important and neglected cross-fertilization between English and Irish history. However, in recognising the \\ninternationalism of the Irish experience, I also want to demonstrate its specificity. Though Darwin's impact is familiar Victorianfare, it adopted a particular configuration in Ireland in response to specific cultural conditions.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/E003494/1","grantId":"AH/E003494/1","fundValue":"18749","fundStart":"2008-01-01","fundEnd":"2008-03-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Ronan Daniel McDonald","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Reading","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
