This parasite attaches to the roots of the host plant causing severe stunting and loss of grain yield. Currently Striga species infest over 40% of the cereal producing areas of SSA; their effects are greatest on infertile soils and those most severely affected are the poorest subsistence farmers upon whom the weed exerts major impacts on poverty and health. At present the most commonly used strategies for alleviating the impact of this parasite include hand weeding, improving soil fertility and the use of 'tolerant' cultivars (which produce some grain even when infected), however success has been limited. While combining several control measures is likely to be necessary for control of Striga, crop losses due to the parasite could be reduced significantly through introducing host resistance genes into the most commonly used cultivars. However, the use of resistant cultivars is limited by a lack of resistant material and by a lack of understanding of the molecular genetic nature of host resistance to Striga. Over the last 5 years we have carried out an extensive screening programme in rice and have identified cultivars that show good post-attachment resistance to S. hermonthica. The discovery of resistance in rice to Striga is of great significance as it is currently the best 'model' cereal for molecular genetic studies as the genome of this crop plant has been sequenced. In this programme we propose to take an integrative approach to identify and investigate the molecular genetic nature of resistance to Striga in rice by combining our extensive knowledge of Striga-host interactions, our novel plant growth systems and modern genomic and comparative genomic techniques. We will then use information gained from rice to determine the extent to which similar resistance occurs in sorghum. Not only will the project enhance our fundamental understanding of the molecular genetic nature of resistance to Striga but it will contribute to more efficient breeding methods for Striga resistance that could be used in regional and national breeding programmes in Africa for rice and sorghum improvement. The improvement of varieties which stabilize yields and their adoption by subsistence farmers is critical for enhanced food security and poverty reduction in West and sub Saharan Africa in the long term.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F004192/1","grantId":"BB/F004192/1","fundValue":"43052","fundStart":"2008-05-01","fundEnd":"2011-10-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Andy  Greenland","coPersons":[],"organisation":"National Inst of Agricultural Botany","findingsText":" The aim of this project is to extend our understanding of the molecular genetic basis of post-attachment resistance in\nrice to Striga species and to utilize this knowledge for improvement of both the rice and sorghum crop in Africa by integrating our extensive knowledge of Striga-host interactions, our novel plant growth systems and modern genomic and comparative genomic techniques.\n\nThis is a collaboration with the University of Sheffield. The role of the NIAB team was to provide additional genomic resources to identify genetic loci providing resistance to Striga. This utilised the broad synteny between rice and sorghum established using sequence of markers for the two rice mapping populations. Rice genomic sequence underlying the seven QTLs of interest was identified and the coding sequences used to further determine homologous sorghum QTL regions. Comparison of gene homologues and genic order between rice and sorghum shows that chromosomal synteny assignment on broad marker level is not necessarily denotative of synteny in the QTL region with varying levels of synteny for different QTL. Rice chromosome 10 QTL lacked synteny with sorghum whilst those from other chromosomes show near complete gene order synteny. In addition it is possible to see that rice QTL size in terms of both gene number and physical distance (bp) is not indicative of QTL size in Sorghum. All the information generated at NIAB including marker and gene identities were supplied to the Sheffield team ans were usefd to further define rice resistance genes in the mainproject at Sheffield.
