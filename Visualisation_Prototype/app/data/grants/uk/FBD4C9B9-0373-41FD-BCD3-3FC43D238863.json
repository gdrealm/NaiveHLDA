{"id":"FBD4C9B9-0373-41FD-BCD3-3FC43D238863","title":"Modelling Across the Scales","abstractText":"Multi-scale structure is a key component of many (if not all) complex systems where phenomena at one scale can produce unexpected results at another. The aim of this summer school is to provide a training in the mathematical and numerical techniques required to understand multi-scale structure, put firmly in the context of applications and interdisciplinary interactions. The summer school will have at its core four instructional courses given by leading experts on the themes of: A. Modelling and analysis of multiple scale problems, B. Modelling and simulation of microstructure evolution, C. Multi-scale analysis and stochastic differential equations, D. Multi-scale behaviour in the geosciences. These will be supplemented by tutorial sessions. There will also be a series of seminars on complex systems given by expert researchers from academia and industry. The summer school will provide an opportunity for the attendees to both learn the techniques described above, and also to network across the disciplines. There will be an opportunity for PhD students to describe their work to a broad audience and all attendees will be registered on the mailing list of the Bath Institute for Complex Systems. This will allow them to be informed of future developments and events in the field of Complex Systems.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D033098/1","grantId":"EP/D033098/1","fundValue":"46008","fundStart":"2006-04-01","fundEnd":"2006-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Chris  Budd","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Bath","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
