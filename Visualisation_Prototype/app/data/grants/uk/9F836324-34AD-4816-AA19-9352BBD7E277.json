This indicator is closely watched by the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee.</p>\n\n<p>We propose to use a rich and realistic life-cycle model of consumption, saving and housing choices in order to discriminate between three different mechanisms that may link movements in house prices and consumption:</p>\n\n<ol>\n \n\n <li>A ‘wealth effect’: increases in house prices raise households’ wealth, raising their desired level of expenditure;<br /></li>\n\n <li>A ‘credit constraints’ channel: house price growth increases the collateral available to homeowners, thus loosening borrowing constraints and facilitating higher consumption; and<br /></li>\n\n <li>A ‘common causality’ model: factors such as changes in expected income growth, tax changes or changes in credit market conditions lead to increases in both households’ expenditure and house prices.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>We simulate the behaviour of households faced with the common house price shocks that recent cohorts of UK households actually experienced during the last thirty years. We will simulate different scenarios that effectively ‘shut off’ the different proposed mechanisms in turn, and examine how this affects the simulated data in comparison to actual data.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E00573X/1","grantId":"ES/E00573X/1","fundValue":"43919","fundStart":"2006-10-02","fundEnd":"2007-10-02","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Orazio  Attanasio","coPersons":["Andrew Mark Leicester","Matthew  Wakefield"],"organisation":"Institute for Fiscal Studies","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
