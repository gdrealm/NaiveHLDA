Such uncertainties start with the definition of the population of a theory - the set of observations for which a theory claims validity - and continues with the appropriateness of sampling techniques when observations have different ex ante probabilities to be drawn into the sample. Other sources of model uncertainty include uncertainty about the operationalisation of variables, the correct set of explanatory variables, functional forms, and other model specifications including dynamics and spatial dependence of observations.</li>\n\n <li>The authors develop specific robustness tests for each type of model uncertainty.</li>\n\n <li>Finally, the project develops a technique to test the average effect over all model specifications even if the expected coefficients differ across models. </li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L003163/1","grantId":"ES/L003163/1","fundValue":"197605","fundStart":"2013-08-01","fundEnd":"2015-01-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Thomas  Pluemper","coPersons":["Eric  Neumayer"],"organisation":"University of Essex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
