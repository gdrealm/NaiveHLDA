{"id":"8475256E-D5FE-4009-BB4D-9609A0AFC56E","title":"Mothering with a Difference: Concepts and Practices of Mothering in Contemporary Women's Writing in French","abstractText":"The changing face of the family and the changes in women's lives and expectations in the late 20th and early 21st century, in France as elsewhere, are having an impact on women as mot11ers. European and French legislation on part time work\n, maternity leave and rights and the Frencll PaCS law covering same sex couples have done much for equal rights. Yet, as feminist analyses have shown, they tend to endorse rather than challenge conventional representations of women's role as mothers in society, and thus their effects are limited. Literary narratives offer alternative insights into how women themselves perceive mothering &quot;'mothering' being a key term of analysis since it privileges women's own experiences as mothers over more conventional perceptions of 'motherhood'.\n\nThe aim of the research is to publish a monograph, which investigates how mothering is portrayed in French women-authored literature of the last 15 years an exciting body of world at the cutting edge of contemporary Frenc11 literature. Through close readings, this study explores the ways in which women's own narratives, fictional and autobiographical, express and define mothering in these changing times. Drawing on feminist debates and theory from an appropriate range of disciplines (sociology, psychoanalysis, anthropology, literary studies, trauma studies), it considers the extent to which the narratives chosen for analysis reinforce or challenge conventional concepts of mothering. Following an introductory chapter, which sets out the historical, theoretical and literary context for the study, the major themes raised by this body of work are explored through a series of chapter-by &quot;chapter case studies. Ultimately, the research explores what implications these narratives have for our understandings of contemporary mothering. What do they tell us about women's desires, fears, fantasies and imaginative concepts of mothering? What can they tell us about the emerging trends and changing experiences of contemporary mothering in France?\n\nThis research project will produce the first published study to focus exclusively on narratives of mothering in recent French literature, and it will also offer in i depth analyses of a fascinating new generation of writers. It will contribute important new insights to French literary and cultural studies specifically and Feminist work more generally, and will be of interest to undergraduate and postgraduate students, doctoral and postdoctoral researchers and scholars in French studies and gender studies in the UK, Europe, USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/D500249/1","grantId":"AH/D500249/1","fundValue":"16252","fundStart":"2006-05-01","fundEnd":"2006-08-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Gill  Rye","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of London","findingsText":" 1. The study documents a turn to mothers as narrative subjects (rather than objects of others' narratives) in women's writing in France of the 1990s and 2000s. \n\n2. It reveals the prevalence of loss in new narratives of mothering.\n\n3. Maternal guilt is found to be on-going, and contributes to the norms by which mothers are judged, and judge themselves.\n\n4. Maternal ambivalence, arising from the tensions between mothering and the needs and desires of the woman, is commonly experienced and ' Literary narratives and representations only partially reflect reality; they also reflect on it, and they creatively and imaginatively express, explore and shape experience and emotions. The new narratives of mothering offer insights into the complexity of mothers' subjectivities and intimate experiences. As such, they have the potential to supplement existing sociological and psychological studies of mothering by offering another dimension of expression - that of literary motifs, images and oth Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy","dataset":"gtr"}
