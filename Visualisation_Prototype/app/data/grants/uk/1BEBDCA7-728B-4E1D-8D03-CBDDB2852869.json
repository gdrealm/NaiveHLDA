This project will establish the extent to which the capacity for 'emotional literacy', i.e. reflecting on and managing emotional responses, is currently developed in journalism trainings, it will collate views from across the industry on how this could be done, study the effects of emotional literacy training, and outline a strategy for developing emotional literacy amongst journalists.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=119251/1","grantId":"119251/1","fundValue":"74848","fundStart":"2006-05-01","fundEnd":"2007-07-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Barry  Richards","coPersons":["Stephen  Jukes","David  Bradshaw"],"organisation":"Bournemouth University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
