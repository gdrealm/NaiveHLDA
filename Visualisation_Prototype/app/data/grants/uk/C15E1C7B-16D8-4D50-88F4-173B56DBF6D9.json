In this way, music can form a powerful personal, social and emotional aspect of their lives, enhancing physical and psychological well-being, just as it does for people with 'normal' hearing. Current research on music listening behaviour highlights the ways in which people use music to facilitate day-to-day activities (e.g. while doing housework, travelling or working), to manage mood and emotions (e.g. during exercise or when feeling particularly elated or depressed), and for therapeutic reasons (e.g. to manage pain or aid relaxation). This research, however, is usually carried out with 'normally' hearing adults and there is a lack of understanding about how mild, moderate, severe or profound deafness and the use of HAs affect music listening. There are currently over 10 million people with some level of deafness in the UK representing one in six of the population and this figure is set to rise dramatically to 14.5 million by 2031.\n\nThis three year project represents the first large-scale systematic investigation of how music listening experiences are affected by deafness and the use of HAs. This interdisciplinary research brings together academic researchers in fields of music psychology and audiology and is concerned with questions of auditory musical perception. By exploring the links between hearing impairments, HAs and music listening behaviours, this research seeks to improve the perception of music using HA technology. In-depth case studies exploring subjective experiences will set the context for a wider national survey of music listening among people with hearing impairments. Alongside this psychological research, audiometric data will be used to quantify levels of hearing impairment and amplification to provide a clear picture of musical auditory perception. A stakeholder report outlining the current and potential role of manufacturers, distributers, audiologists, and users with respect to the improved function of HAs for music listening, will be sent to all parties. It will outline fitting strategies of benefit to NHS and private sector clinics. It will also highlight priorities for research and development in new digital signal processing of benefit to manufacturers. The proposal includes resources for a bespoke website and discussion forum which will provide the general public with facts and figures, research findings, useful contacts, and a means to interact with the project and other HA users interested in music listening issues. The website and forum will be promoted though existing links with deafness organisations and through existing twitter feeds (@musicndeafness) and social media to maximise public engagement.\n\nThe research findings will directly benefit people with all levels of deafness and HA users, both in the UK and internationally through open access content on the website and forum, and via more traditional modes of dissemination including conferences. This growing population will benefit from knowledge exchange provided by psychological insights into aural musical rehabilitation. It will support audiologists in addressing music listening challenges presented by patients in their clinics in a field in which there exists no formal training. It will also provide an empirical basis for manufacturers of HAs to align their signal processing research and development activities with real-world problems and experiences of everyday music listening. Improved access to music using HAs will benefit people of all ages, facilitating music education for deaf children and young people, musical listening and performance in adulthood, and continued musical engagement into old age. This research has the potential to transform thousands of people's lives.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/M00368X/1","grantId":"AH/M00368X/1","fundValue":"197836","fundStart":"2015-02-01","fundEnd":"2018-01-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Alinka Elizabeth  Greasley","coPersons":["Harriet  Crook"],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
