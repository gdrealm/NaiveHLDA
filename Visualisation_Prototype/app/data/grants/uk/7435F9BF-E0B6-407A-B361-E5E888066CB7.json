{"id":"7435F9BF-E0B6-407A-B361-E5E888066CB7","title":"DiRAC SMP Facility: The Structure of the Universe","abstractText":"This proposal aims to address key questions about the fundamental structure of the Universe and the origin and nature of the galaxies, stars and planets within it. This proposal is to enhance the STFC DiRAC Facility which provides the primary computational platform for UK particle physicists, cosmologists and astrophysicists. The proposal will fund a flexible shared-memory (SMP) node with 16TB. This proposal will advance our understanding in 3 key scientific areas:\n\nA. Science exploitation of the CMB and Large-scale Structure surveys: \nThe cosmic microwave background (CMB) remains the premier source for cosmological information. Planck satellite data dramatically supersedes the previous WMAP data and we will use it to constrain fundamental cosmology. With Planck data releases scheduled for 2013 and 2014, this upgrade will leverage the proprietary data, maximizing science exploitation by COSMOS members. Work on large-scale structure encompasses using surveys to constrain the properties of the Universe and understanding the hierarchical formation of galaxies. \n\nB. Observational consequences of the Early Universe. \nThe consortium has pioneered the use of lattice simulations to understand the physics of non-linear phenomena in the early universe. This is expected in most cosmological models, including those with phase transitions, cosmic defects and extra dimensions. The challenge using the new SMP node will be to calculate the observable consequences of these theories, which can range from signatures in the CMB or large-scale structure through to the production of dark matter or primordial gravitational waves.\n\nC. Extra-solar planets and their atmospheres.\nThe SMP node will also support key UK research in extra-solar planets. This is concerned with the observation and characterisation of exoplanets and their atmospheres, developing key numerical codes which are vital to this international endeavour. The new SMP system will allow much more information to be extracted from spectroscopic data from exoplanet environments. This will help us answer some of the oldest questions in science such as: Are there worlds beyond our solar system? Are they numerous or rare? How many of them have the right conditions for life?","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/M007065/1","grantId":"ST/M007065/1","fundValue":"226873","fundStart":"2014-04-01","fundEnd":"2017-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Edward Paul Shellard","coPersons":["Ulrich  Sperhake"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
