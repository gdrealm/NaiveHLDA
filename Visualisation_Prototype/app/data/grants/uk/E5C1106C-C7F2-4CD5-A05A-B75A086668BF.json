{"id":"E5C1106C-C7F2-4CD5-A05A-B75A086668BF","title":"Bernini: Art as Performance","abstractText":"This book addresses the relationship between visual and performance cultures in the work of the seventeenth-century Roman sculptor Gian Lorenzo Bernini. As a sculptor and architect, theatre director, playwright, actor and scenographer, his collective oeuvre epitomises the issues under discussion. Yet there is no book-length historical investigation of this subject.\\n\\nThe analysis proceeds by shifting from an analogy with theatre, to performance, in order to include its greater diversity of genres. This is historically justified because formal theatre in seventeenth-century Italy arose within a composite type of cultural entertainment embedded within ritual and social life. It is in this context that historians have singled out 'the performance of culture' as the dominant interpretive key for the period, encompassing not only the rise of opera and ballet within aristocratic festivals but also its court masques, commedia dell'arte improvisations, sacred oratory, academy recitals, and the pluriform rituals of church and court. The book will interweave these various aspects of performance with a selective study of Bernini's sculpture. Art-historical texts from the period envisaged his artistic ensembles as 'theatres' for social life, materialisations of the abiding literary metaphor of 'all the world as a stage'. The will to animate art objects took on a heightened intensity within this culture of performance, which Bernini's work best represents. The book thus analyses how Bernini's works 'performed' in a series of cultural milieux. \\n\\nFirst, it focuses on the role of the princely art collection in early modern court culture. It argues that art objects acted as 'conversation pieces' for a gamut of courtly entertainments, eliciting an array of performances from guests as occasion demanded. Specifically, it looks at Bernini's early sculptures for the Villa Borghese, which visitors endowed with the power of seeming speech in courtly games of aristocratic wit. \\n\\nSecondly, it analyses dialogic exchange between sculptures in the public sphere. A group of sculptures in Rome's streets and squares became the unofficial mouthpieces of protest against papal urbanism by means of verses pasted to their socles, known as pasquinades. Bernini's civic works commissioned by popes were often the butt of the pasquinaders' wit. The book analyses the structure of these sculptural exchanges and their links with popular theatre.\\n\\nThirdly, it examines Bernini's studio as a social space, part workshop, part 'salon'. Objects emerged from it enmeshed in a web of performed social relations enacted throughout their progress, by models, students, and courtly patrons. Eye-witness accounts of Bernini's working methods relate his means for capturing his model in motion to attain a lifelike animation that seemed, to his contemporaries, to make marble 'speak'. Concomitantly, Bernini transformed his artistic labour into a 'performance' for his visitors, who came to witness his means of artistic illusion.\\n\\nFinally, it analyses links between religious drama, ephemeral decorations for church festivals, and Bernini's permanent works for church interiors. Church tableaux and processional floats typically consisted of life-size terracotta figures set in painted flats, like stage scenery, executed by artists like Bernini. He also undertook scenographic designs for religious theatre, a genre that included lifts and cloud machines to convey scenes of divine transport. These ephemera coalesced in Bernini's religious sculptures, acting as 'intermediary forms' in his artistic process.\\n\\nThe resulting publication will be of interest to scholars of Bernini, 'Baroque' art, seventeenth-century Italian studies, early modern cultural history; and to those pursuing the relationship between visual and performance arts across and beyond the discipline of art history.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/G009201/1","grantId":"AH/G009201/1","fundValue":"26210","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-01-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Genevieve  Warwick","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
