DNA is composed of two polymer strands that are entwined to form a twisted ladder, known as the double helix. The rungs of the ladder are made up of a DNA alphabet A, C, T and G. These alphabet pieces, known as nucleotides, pair according to special rules, A will pair only with a T in the opposite strand, and G only with a C thus each strand of the DNA molecule serves as a template to specify the sequence of nucleotides during duplication, or replication, of the complementary strand. The process of replicating our genetic material is awe-inspiring in its complexity, as it involves copying billions of nucleotides with exceptional speed and accuracy. This amazing feat is performed by a group of proteins that together form a 'replication machine'. Understanding the function of each of these proteins is critical since failure of any one of them may result in a life threatening disease. In addition to the problem of accurate replication, DNA is under continual onslaught from environmental chemicals and radiation (mainly the sun's rays). These alter the DNA bases so that they no longer pair up, as they should, again a life-threatening situation. Biological systems have evolved a number of enzymes (biological catalysts) that are involved in repairing damaged DNA and flap endonuclease is one of these vital enzymes. Without flap endonucleases life forms cannot exist. Understanding how flap endonuclease functions at the molecular level is the principle aim of this work.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F014732/1","grantId":"BB/F014732/1","fundValue":"362890","fundStart":"2008-04-01","fundEnd":"2011-09-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Jane Alison Grasby","coPersons":["Nicholas H Williams","Jon Roland Sayers"],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
