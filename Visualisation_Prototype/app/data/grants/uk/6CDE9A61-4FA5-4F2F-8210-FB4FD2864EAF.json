A pre-post design will be employed. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This design will record changes and track outcome measures and variables that could be attributable to peer tutoring as tutoring proceeds in two mathematics topics. The first tutoring topic will be Number and Measurement, and the second will focus on Data Handling. Control groups do not form part of this study. </p>\n\n<p>The study is not trying to establish that peer tutoring in mathematics is effective. Instead the proposal aims to discover whether tutor status influences outcome measures. Previous studies have not examined predictive nature of tutor status on outcome measures. The sample will be composed from 20 primary schools.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-3201-A","grantId":"RES-000-22-3201-A","fundValue":"28411","fundStart":"2010-05-01","fundEnd":"2011-04-15","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Allen  Thurston","coPersons":["Keith James Topping"],"organisation":"University of York","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
