{"id":"B24A6DDB-F351-4FFB-8ED5-B603396CA361","title":"Robust graph analysis of brain connectivity","abstractText":"A broad range of neurological diseases and disorders have been linked with pathological alterations in the connectivity of the brain. However, robust methods for identifying and characterising abnormalities in connectivity, their evolution over time and response to treatments, are lacking; and addressing this omission represents a pressing clinical need. In this proposal we aim to meet this need using novel methods based on medical imaging and graph theory, a well-established mathematical framework with which to describe and characterise interconnected systems. To establish a clear baseline, we will characterise the typical &quot;normal&quot; connectivity network, and model statistically its variability in a healthy population. We will also investigate approaches to classifying graphs into groups, and identify common factors underlying structural and functional connectivity, to be used as new biomarkers. We will use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) to obtain connectivity information in the living brain; and childhood epilepsy and autism spectrum disorders will be investigated as neurological disorders which can display altered brain connectivity. Our developments will also be applicable to other data which can be represented graphically. This work will provide major novel tools for graph analysis of brain connectivity, thereby driving connectivity network methods towards reliable and routine clinical application. Through our close links with clinical colleagues we will ensure that our developments are well positioned for wide-ranging applicability, elucidating connectivity failures in disease and their recovery with treatment.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J016292/1","grantId":"EP/J016292/1","fundValue":"348664","fundStart":"2012-09-24","fundEnd":"2015-09-23","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Our work on identifying important subnetworks in brain connectivity graphs has been applied to the study of functional connectivity in young children, and to structural connectivity in multiple sclerosis.

We have discovered that EEG data is better at predicting fMRI-based functional connectivity than vice-versa, and continue to investigate the normal variability in brain connectivity features. Methodological work is still ongoing, but applications to clinical research in autism, Huntington's disease and childhood epilepsy are planned or underway, and we anticipate a range of other future uses.
