First, the retrospective conversion of records for c. 47,500 printed items which remain to be catalogued electronically. This will mean that records for all the library's books are included in an established electronic catalogue which is already available online. Second, the identification and cataloguing of Gladstone's own books, based on approximately 32,000 items in the Foundation Collection at St Deiniol's. This will result in a database containing an annotated bibliography of Gladstone's collection which can be accessed remotely via a password.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=112174/1","grantId":"112174/1","fundValue":"319919","fundStart":"2006-02-01","fundEnd":"2009-07-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Juliet Victoria John","coPersons":["Patsy  Williams"],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
