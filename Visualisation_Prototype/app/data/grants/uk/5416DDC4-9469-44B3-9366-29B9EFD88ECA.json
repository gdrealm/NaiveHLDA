The recurrent nature of clinical depression, together with the burden it places on patients and their families, makes this condition one of leading medical causes of suffering and disability. Understanding the biochemical changes in the brain in depression will help us devise better treatments and also improve efforts at prevention. A neurotransmitter called serotonin (5-HT) plays an important role in both the causation of depression and in current drug treatments. In this study we will use advances in brain imaging to study how 5-HT acts in the brain to alter mood. For example we will use magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to see how 5-HT interacts with special neurons in the brain that use a chemical messenger called glutamate. We believe that the interactions between 5 HT and glutamate may be very important in helping us understand the cause of depression and in developing more effective methods of treatment. A major problem in the treatment of depression is the unpredictability of response to current drug treatments; some patients do well, others are not helped very much. We believe that antidepressants which work through 5-HT such as the selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may produce their therapeutic effects by acting on the way the brain analyses emotional information. The use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) allows us to examine the brain networks involved in emotional experience. We will use therefore use fMRI to study how these brain networks are influenced by SSRIs in depressed patients and whether the changes we see enable us to predict those patients who will do well with treatment.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0701421","grantId":"G0701421","fundValue":"1625740","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2013-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Philip John Cowen","coPersons":["Catherine  Harmer"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
