Therefore, slowing down the biological process of ageing might be a very effective strategy against tumours, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, arthritis and many more. There is not a single mechanism that causes ageing. However, there is strong evidence that the loss of function of mitochondria is an important driver of the ageing process at a cellular level. Mitochondria are the 'power houses' of a cell: they use oxygen to burn fuels derived from nutrients to generate energy that sustains all cellular functions. This process is almost perfect, but not completely: some oxygen gets released as free radicals, i.e. molecules that can react with and destroy almost any other molecule in the cell. Loss of mitochondrial function in ageing therefore reduces the energy available to the cell, disturbs its metabolism because of sub-optimal fuel processing and may induce more and more molecular damage. There are some interventions that can prolong healthy life and postpone the decrease of mitochondrial function. Caloric restriction, reducing the food intake to about half of what an animal would eat normally, is the most robust of these. Long-term caloric restriction is evidently not acceptable to humans (and it is not clear whether it would work there). However, it provides an experimental tool: If we identify the regulatory mechanisms that are activated by caloric restriction and help maintain normal mitochondrial function, we might have found processes that regulate the rate of biological ageing and that, if activated by less draconian measures than hunger, might help to postpone age-related disease and prolong healthy lifespan. This is the goal of the present application. We do know already major signalling pathways that are altered in ageing and where signalling is restored under caloric restriction. However, we do know less well how these signalling pathways interact with each other and how they impinge on the function of individual mitochondrial proteins and complexes. To gain such knowledge is important, because all these pathways are multifunctional, meaning that interventions at that level are prone to multiple side effects, which would not be tolerable in the context of ageing. Therefore, much more specific information is needed. To gain this, we make use of recent developments in high throughput analytical techniques, which now allow to obtain precise genome-wide information about the regulation of gene expression and protein abundance at multiple levels. So far, multi-level data integration has been seriously hampered by biological (different animals), technical and methodological (experiments being performed in different labs with sometimes unknown variation of parameters) variation. For the first time in ageing research, we will combine genome-wide information ranging from the epigenetic regulation of gene expression over the transcriptional level to the mitochondrial proteome, all generated within a single experiment and from the very same animals. As part of the development of a BBSRC-funded Centre for Integrative Systems Biology of Ageing, we developed powerful software for data integration and pathway analysis, which we will use now to integrate the information. This data analysis will allow us to understand how interactions between mitochondrial proteins change during ageing and under caloric restriction, how these changes can induce changed mitochondrial function and at which regulatory level they are triggered. Analysis of the interaction networks will lead to the identification of novel candidates for interventions aimed at maintaining mitochondrial function during ageing. We will test those candidates by manipulating their expression levels in cultured cells and measuring the consequences of these interventions for mitochondrial function.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I020748/1","grantId":"BB/I020748/1","fundValue":"508887","fundStart":"2011-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-09-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Thomas  Von Zglinicki","coPersons":["Anil  Wipat","Tom  Kirkwood","John Cummings Mathers"],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
