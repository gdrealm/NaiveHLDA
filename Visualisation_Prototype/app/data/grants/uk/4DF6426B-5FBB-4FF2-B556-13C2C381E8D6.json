{"id":"4DF6426B-5FBB-4FF2-B556-13C2C381E8D6","title":"Cardiff Linked Grant","abstractText":"Previous support from STFC through this PATT grant has enabled Cardiff astronomers to carry out their PI and co-I duties for observing programmes including SCUBA-2 and HARP on JCMT, UKIRT, MMT, ATCA and MOPRA. This support has been crucial in supporting Cardiff's active research goals, ranging from characterizing the most distant known objects in the Universe, a full census of star formation activity in the Galactic Plane, gas and dust in nearby galaxies and investigating dark gas in our nearest neighbour, Andromeda. As well as individual PI projects, Cardiff are also active members of many JCMT Legacy programmes including the JCMT Cosmology Legacy Survey (CLS), SASSY, the Galactic Plane Survey (JPS) and the Gould Belt Survey. Here we propose for continued support to enable Cardiff astronomers to (a) exploit the many Herschel projects which Cardiff leads and require multi-wavelength follow up to understand; (b) support availability of new millimetre instrumentation and (c) continue the use of submillimetre cameras APEX and SMA to carry out investigations of the dusty Universe throughout cosmic history.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/L00383X/1","grantId":"ST/L00383X/1","fundValue":"35426","fundStart":"2014-05-11","fundEnd":"2016-05-10","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Haley Louise Gomez","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":" This funding allowed us the use the JCMT telescope to study the dust in our nearest neighbour spiral galaxy, Andromeda at the highest resolution than ever studied before.
