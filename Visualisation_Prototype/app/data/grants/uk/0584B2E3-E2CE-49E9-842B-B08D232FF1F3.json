An Investigation of the Traffic Between London, Hong Kong and Beijing","abstractText":"<p>This research investigates an emerging migration circuit with important implications for the UK, China and its Special Administrative Region (SAR) Hong Kong. It explores the social composition of the traffic along these circuits and drills into the calculations, strategies and reasoning of young migrants aged between 22 and 32 years old.</p>\n\n<p>Extending BIS’s and other researchers’ focus from students, the focus of this study will be university graduates who have migrated independently and no longer in education: young people, importantly, at the launch-point of their careers.</p>\n\n<p>We want to know:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>who these young migrants are and why they migrate along these routes. </li>\n\n <li>what resources or attributes they anticipate migration provides them and how they intend deploying these in their own personal/professional lives</li>\n\n <li>the thinking behind their journeys - how do they compare departure and arrival cities. </li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>In short, we want to know how mobility plays-out in how young migrants think about themselves and their lives. We expect to uncover new links between biography and geography and thus make important theoretical and empirical contributions to migration studies as well as to the burgeoning field of mobility studies.</p>\n\n<p><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J017272/1","grantId":"ES/J017272/1","fundValue":"79696","fundStart":"2012-12-21","fundEnd":"2015-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Caroline  Knowles","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Goldsmiths College","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
