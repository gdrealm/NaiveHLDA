{"id":"7E378008-CB9F-4734-B9D7-2ABDF2D9FC71","title":"Liberalism Without Perfection: Arguments for a Political Liberalism","abstractText":"My research is in liberal political philosophy. More exactly, it is about what kind of reasons or arguments provide the best justification for liberal rights and institutions. Unlike authoritarian regimes, in a liberal democracy the use of state power should be justifiable to citizens. But what kinds of reasons can serve to justify the use of state power in a liberal democracy? \\n\\nMany philosophers have argued that state actions are justifiable when their aim is to improve the goodness of citizens' lives, measured in terms of some intrinsic value or values. According to one plausible view, freedom or autonomy is presumed to be at the heart of what it means to lead a fully good, flourishing life. Liberal rights and political institutions are therefore justified because they are a necessary element of this flourishing. The liberal state sets us free, and this freedom empowers us to realize the best aspects of our own nature. Because this view offers a determinate conception of the human good, and justifies liberalism in terms of its contribution towards achieving that good, it is called liberal perfectionism. \\n\\nI argue, however, that that there are a number of fatal difficulties with the liberal perfectionist position. First, I argue that liberal perfectionism's focus on autonomy as a central part of the human good lacks plausibility. Second, I claim that liberal perfectionism, despite claims to the contrary, is inescapably paternalistic and thus fails to treat citizens with the respect it claims they are due. Finally, I argue that liberal perfectionism lacks a plausible account of political legitimacy, it is unable to explain how the state gains the moral right to rule over its citizens. \\n\\nInstead, I aim to develop a distinctive version of political liberalism. Political liberalism remains faithful to the ideal that state authority must be justifiable to citizens by insisting that the state abstain from endorsing any particular views about the goodness of a life. Legitimate political reasons are instead defined as only those that could be endorsed by any reasonable person, no matter what their plan of life may be. \\n\\nThe book on which I'm working has three main features. First, it offers major and original criticisms of liberal perfectionism, something which no recent monograph in political philosophy has done. Second, it develops a distinctive account of political liberalism. Finally, it defends political liberalism from a number of serious objections. In the book's final chapter I also consider how political liberalism can be applied to a pressing political issue: the toleration of fundamentalist minorities within liberal democratic societies. \\n\\nAlthough liberal political philosophy sometimes proceeds at a fairly abstract level, it also bears on many practical issues of real significance. For example, most liberal democracies currently have laws which prohibit or restrict activities such as prostitution, gambling, smoking, drinking, recreational drug use, same-sex marriage, and pornography partly on the grounds that these activities are 'bad' for us or are otherwise inconsistent with living a valuable human life. The debate between liberal perfectionism and political liberalism is directly relevant to such policies, and it is one of the goals of my monograph to show that public policies based on this kind of reasoning are insufficiently liberal, and so fail to accord citizens the respect which they are due as independent moral agents.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/F004303/1","grantId":"AH/F004303/1","fundValue":"23791","fundStart":"2008-02-01","fundEnd":"2008-05-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Jonathan  Quong","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
