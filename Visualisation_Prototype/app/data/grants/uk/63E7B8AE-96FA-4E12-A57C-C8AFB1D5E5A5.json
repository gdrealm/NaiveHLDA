{"id":"63E7B8AE-96FA-4E12-A57C-C8AFB1D5E5A5","title":"WELLINE: WELL-BEING AND THE INDOOR ENVIRONMENT","abstractText":"Most people spend the majority of their lives indoor, particularly in older age. Indoor environments can play a major role in lifelong health and wellbeing, and this proposal will focus on lifelong environmental factors associated with chronic disorders affecting bones, joints, nervous system, hearts and lungs, which are amongst the most prevalent conditions found in the older population. These conditions (e.g. arthritis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (smoker?s lung), high blood pressure, Parkinson?s disease, etc.) can considerably affect the quality of life of older people, be potentially life threatening, and place a significant burden on public health resources. The role of the indoor environment is potentially very important in these conditions because as these conditions worsen, mobility lessens and a greater amount of time is spent indoors. \nThe mechanisms linking indoor environmental factors and health outcomes are complex, and the involvement of a multidisciplinary group of stakeholders is required in order to unravel them. By identifying the interactions between lifelong indoor environmental factors and key chronic diseases affecting the older population, this proposal will identify effective interventions on the indoor environment which could alleviate existing cardiopulmonary, musculoskeletal or neurological conditions in older people, and/or prevent the onset and/or mitigate progression of such conditions during the life course.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0900014","grantId":"G0900014","fundValue":"49957","fundStart":"2009-05-01","fundEnd":"2010-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Jon  Ayres","coPersons":["Isabella  Myers","Marcella  Ucci","James  Goodwin"],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
