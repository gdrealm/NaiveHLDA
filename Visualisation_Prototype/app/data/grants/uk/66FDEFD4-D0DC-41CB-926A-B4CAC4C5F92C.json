The series generated an international dialogue between scholars from (for example) South Korea, India, Eastern Europe, the Netherlands, Spain, Australia, the US and various areas of the UK.</p>\n\n<p>It focused on young peopleâ€™s consumption, use and production of media and popular cultural forms (including audio-visual, digital and online media) in the context of cultural and economic globalisation. It involved both experienced and early career researchers in the field, bringing together scholars from different disciplines with research users and practitioners from education, youth work, policy making and campaigning; and supported postgraduate students. It reviewed theories and methodologies in the field in the light of broader cultural developments, specifically relating to globalisation, and provided a forum for newly emerging debates and empirical work in the field, nationally and internationally.<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-451-26-0536","grantId":"RES-451-26-0536","fundValue":"18350","fundStart":"2009-01-01","fundEnd":"2011-04-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  Impact report with key findings was submitted in June 2012  ","person":"David  Buckingham","coPersons":["Mary Jane Kehily"],"organisation":"Institute of Education","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
