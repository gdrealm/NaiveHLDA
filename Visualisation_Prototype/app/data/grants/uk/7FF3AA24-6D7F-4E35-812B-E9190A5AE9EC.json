{"id":"7FF3AA24-6D7F-4E35-812B-E9190A5AE9EC","title":"International Earth System Science PostDoc Network","abstractText":"Many of the challenges we face in earth system science require not only the representation of complex physical processes in climate system models but coupling biogeochemistry, chemistry and the human management with climate. Additionally, the global research community will require components that allow interactions between policy and decision making with environmental and climate considerations. As a step towards a full earth system science approach, an international postdoctoral scientist network for earth system science will be established. This network will serve as a mechanism for promoting the development of the next generation of scientists to be increasingly cross-cutting as will be required by the future of Earth system modeling. An important element will be including participants from developing countries to both contribute their expertise in quickly changing and highly vulnerable environments, as well as to build the human resources in important regions of the globe for future science projects.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/D000866/1","grantId":"NE/D000866/1","fundValue":"47194","fundStart":"2006-09-01","fundEnd":"2009-08-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Marko  Scholze","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
