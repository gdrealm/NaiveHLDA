{"id":"7FB7B85C-EB7B-432F-AB9F-2E810CAB17E8","title":"Thermal Hydraulics for Boiling and Passive Systems","abstractText":"New nuclear power stations are likely to be a major contributor to energy security and reduction of carbon emissions. Such reactors will almost certainly be water-cooled. Whilst water is a very good coolant, steam is not, and the water coolant can become steam under certain conditions. The three themes of this project are each aimed at developing a better understanding of when this transition occurs, and developing better techniques to predict this. This project is an international collaboration, between scientists at the Bhaba Atomic Research Centre (BARC) in India, and groups at three UK universities. The better techniques will be based on experimental measurements of boiling systems to be conducted at BARC, in conjunction with the UK participants, and the development of computational models based on these.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K007777/1","grantId":"EP/K007777/1","fundValue":"797147","fundStart":"2013-03-18","fundEnd":"2015-12-17","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Simon  Walker","coPersons":["Geoffrey F Hewitt","Michael John Bluck","Shuisheng  He","Michael  Fairweather","Raad  Issa"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
