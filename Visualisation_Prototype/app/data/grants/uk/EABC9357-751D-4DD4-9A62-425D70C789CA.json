It is particularly difficult to diagnose with the result that by the time most patients visit their doctor with symptoms the cancer has spread and it is difficult to treat successfully by surgery.\n \nHowever there is a pre-existing benign condition called Barret's oesophagus which can be monitored by gastrointestinal endoscopy. A small percentage of patients with Barrett's oesophagus will develop oesophageal cancer. If these patients can be identified early then it is possible to treat them successfully.\n \nThis research will install a high performance microscope called a SNOM on the infrared free electron laser on the ALICE accelerator at Daresbury. This microscope will make it possible to obtain high resolution chemical images of tissue from patients with Barrett's oesophagus that will make it possible to diagnose whether the patients will go on to develop oesophageal cancer.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/K00154X/1","grantId":"ST/K00154X/1","fundValue":"26355","fundStart":"2012-03-07","fundEnd":"2012-04-06","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Swapan  Chattopadhyay","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
