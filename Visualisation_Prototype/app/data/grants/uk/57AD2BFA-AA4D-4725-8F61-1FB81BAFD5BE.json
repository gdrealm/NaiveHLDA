{"id":"57AD2BFA-AA4D-4725-8F61-1FB81BAFD5BE","title":"Adult Recall of Childhood","abstractText":"<p>Currently there are many cases, usually criminal, in the courts in which the only evidence is witness memory. Often these cases feature one or more adult witnesses recalling memories of, allegedly abusive events, from early childhood. Such memories frequently feature surprisingly specific details such as clothes worn to bed, the clothes worn by their abuser, layout of rooms, colour of furnishings, the weather, time of day, duration and frequency of activities, bodily positions, handedness, etc. Whether it is possible for an adult, say a 35 year-old, to remember such details from a memory dating to below the age of, for instance, 7 years, is unknown. <br /><br />The research will address this lack of knowledge by having adults recall their earliest memories of both positive and negative childhood events. The strict criterion will be that only memories the rememberer really believes are memories should be recalled. A standard questionnaire then explores what details can be remembered, eg clothes, weather, time, feelings, thoughts, etc In this way we will establish what details in general an adult can recall from childhood memories they definitely remember. This will provide a benchmark against which to judge the plausibility of memories.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-189-25-0226","grantId":"RES-189-25-0226","fundValue":"86838","fundStart":"2011-04-01","fundEnd":"2012-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Martin A.
