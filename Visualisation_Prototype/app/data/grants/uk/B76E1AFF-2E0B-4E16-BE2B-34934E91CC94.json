A new testing rig was designed and built as part of the project to allow electrical and mechanical fatigue of piezoelectric ceramics up to temperatures of 200C. Fatigue was carried out both by stress cycling and voltage cycling on single layer and multilayer samples. The BiFeO3 samples were shown to be more resistant to aging and fatigue than both &quot;hard The work was undertaken to demonstrate to the co-sponsor of the work, Rolls Royce Engine Controls Ltd, that the higher temperature BiFeO3 based piezoelectric ceramics could withstand large numbers of operational cycles at elevated temperatures. This knowledge will be used in the design of piezoelectric components for use in future generations of Rolls Royce gas turbine for commercial aviation. \n\n\n\nData concerning the perforamce on the PZT samples tested has been fed-back to the commercial provid Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Electronics,Energy,Leisure Activities/ including Sports/ Recreation and Tourism,Manufacturing/ including Industrial Biotechology,Transport,Other","dataset":"gtr"}
