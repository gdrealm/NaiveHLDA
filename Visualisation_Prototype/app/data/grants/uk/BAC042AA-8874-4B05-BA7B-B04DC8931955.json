{"id":"BAC042AA-8874-4B05-BA7B-B04DC8931955","title":"Inter-disciplinary perspectives on restorative approaches to conflict in schools: exploring international theory and practice","abstractText":"<p>This international inter-disciplinary seminar series investigated restorative justice (RJ) and its increasing application to educational settings (restorative approaches, RA). It involved five seminars in England and Scotland, a core group made up of academics from a range of disciplines, a judge, a QC, teachers, head teachers, policy-makers, charity workers, and representatives from governmental and non governmental institutions. The seminars involved paper presentations from international researchers, practitioners and graduate students, and found that the ways in which RJ is applied varies according to disciplinary norms and assumptions&nbsp; Whilst this provides scope for cross fertilisation; it also increases the need for theoretical coherence.<br /><br />RJ involves an impartial third party facilitating a process whereby an offender (or wrong-doer) is held accountable and makes some form of reparation to the victim. The series found that the core processes of encounter and reparation are effective in diverting young people from crime and improving behaviour and relationships in schools. It also found that some of the claims of RJ proponents concerning the transformative potential of RJ are over-stated, and risk masking social and structural inequalities that are often unaddressed by these approaches. Hence, schools implementing RA should review their organisational, relational and pedagogical practices.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-451-26-0733","grantId":"RES-451-26-0733","fundValue":"18179","fundStart":"2009-11-27","fundEnd":"2011-11-26","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Hilary  Cremin","coPersons":["G  McCluskey","Edward Mark Sellman"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
