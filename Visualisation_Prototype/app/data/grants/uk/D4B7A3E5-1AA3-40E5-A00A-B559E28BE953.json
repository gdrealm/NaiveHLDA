{"id":"D4B7A3E5-1AA3-40E5-A00A-B559E28BE953","title":"The Challenge of Islam: Young Bangladeshis, Marriage and Family in Bangladesh and the UK","abstractText":"<p>Marriage and the family are central issues for understanding contemporary developments in Islam, and they have much to tell us about the appeal of new forms of Islam, including the so-called ‘fundamentalist’ or Islamic movements.&nbsp; The attraction of these new versions of Islam lies in their ability to provide solutions to the problems of contemporary Muslim families in a rapidly changing and often hostile world, and to present a model of personal identity that refocuses the individual Muslim’s life around a vision of marriage, family and community. </p> \n<p>The aim of the project is to examine how marriage and the family are changing among young female and male Bangladeshis. Using the methods of social anthropology (principally extended interviews and participant observation), the project will investigate how young Bangladeshis before and after marriage think of themselves in relation to their future or actual partners, wider family network and community, and how far these ideas have been influenced by modernist forms of Islam. Research will be carried out with young Bangladeshis in rural Bangladesh, urban Bangladesh (Dhaka) and in the UK. Relevant Islamic organisations will also be studied, both through their writings and through interviews and participant observation. <br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-0616","grantId":"RES-062-23-0616","fundValue":"348636","fundStart":"2008-01-01","fundEnd":"2011-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Santi Theresa Rozario","coPersons":["Sophie  Gilliat-Ray","Geoffrey  Samuel"],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
