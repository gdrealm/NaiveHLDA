Considerable success has been achieved in protecting humans and animals against infectious diseases with the use of vaccines. However, new methods of vaccination and greater understanding of ways to boost the strength of immune responses are needed to protect against new diseases and to eliminate infections that are not well seen by the immune system. New vaccine formulations and improved methods to stimulate immune responses also have the potential to protect against, and even eliminate, some cancers. Potent immunity is mediated by 'killer' T cells, which can directly destroy target cells that are infected by virus or bacteria, or that are otherwise recognized as abnormal, such as tumour cells. The components of the infectious agent or abnormal cell that are recognized by the immune system are made inside the cell, and have to be processed and displayed outside the cell to be recognized by T cells. We currently believe that immune cells called dendritic cells must also acquire the components of the infected cells, probably by 'eating' fragments of similarly infected cells, and use these foreign fragments to teach some of the T cells to become killer T cells. Some heat-induced proteins in infected cells and tumour cells, have been found to increase the stimulation of killer T cells. This research project will examine the effects of production of heat-induced proteins by target cells and dendritic cells, on inducing a strong killer T cell responses against a component of a virus which is expressed in the target cells. The target cells, or dendritic cells which have 'eaten' the target cells, will be used as a vaccine to test whether immunity against the 'infected' cells is generated. Also, the changes in the dendritic cells that induce strong killer T cell responses against the modified target cells, will be fully analysed. These experiments will reveal mechanisms that enhance immunity to intracellular components and will identify ways to improve the design of the next generation of protective vaccines.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D015944/1","grantId":"BB/D015944/1","fundValue":"370483","fundStart":"2006-08-01","fundEnd":"2009-12-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Douglas Glenn Millar","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
