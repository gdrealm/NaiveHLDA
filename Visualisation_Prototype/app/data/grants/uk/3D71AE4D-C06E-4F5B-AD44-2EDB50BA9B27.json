Phosphate groups are added by enzymes termed protein kinases and removed by opposing activities termed protein phosphatases. We are interested in a complex of proteins termed 'Elongator' that is found in all higher cells including those of plants and animals such as ourselves. We have been using yeast cells as a model system for these studies because they provide an experimental system in which both genetic and biochemical approaches to biological questions can be combined in a particularly powerful way. Elongator has been proposed to play a number of cellular roles but most recently it has been discovered that it is important for the correct functioning of transfer RNAs, special molecules that are required for cells to make more protein molecules using their genetic templates, and this is probablyElongator's primary function. We have found that one of the components of the Elongator complex appears to be regulated by phosphorylation, even though this might mean that Elongator is not fully active under all circumstances. Thus the cell's ability to synthesis specific proteins may be controlled through this mechanism. In our proposed work we will combine the expertise of our two laboratories to study both how and why Elongator may be regulated by phosphorylation. We will examine whether changes in Elongator activity lead to effects on the synthesis of specific proteins in the cell and identify both the protein kinases involved in phosphorylating Elongator and the specific sites in the component proteins of Elongator that are modified by these protein kinases. By defining individual sites of phosphorylation we can generate mutants that either cannot be phosphorylated at all or that mimic the presence of a phosphate group. We will use such mutants to build up a detailed picture of how specific phosphhorylation events affect Elongator function.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F019106/1","grantId":"BB/F019106/1","fundValue":"284428","fundStart":"2008-06-01","fundEnd":"2011-05-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Raffael  Schaffrath","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Leicester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
