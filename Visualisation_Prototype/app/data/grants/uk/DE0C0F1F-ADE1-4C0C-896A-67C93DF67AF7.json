Thus, although each seminar addresses a relatively self-contained issue, the seminar series as a whole provides a synthesised review enabling the development of comprehensive inter-disciplinary research proposals for theoretically informed policy research, the development of new policy agendas and innovative and collaborative practical initiatives.</p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-451-25-4288","grantId":"RES-451-25-4288","fundValue":"15370","fundStart":"2008-02-14","fundEnd":"2009-09-13","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Cara  Aitchison","coPersons":["Nigel  Morgan","Stephen  Page"],"organisation":"University of the West of England","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
