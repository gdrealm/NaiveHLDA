There are many factors that give rise to this temperature variation but the main ones are; the amount of heat energy arriving at the surface from the sun (which is smaller at the poles than the equator), the reflectivity of the Earth (called the albedo) which determines how much of the sun's energy is simply reflected back to space (and includes clouds and ice at the surface) which cool the surface and the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere which act as a blanket around the Earth (preventing heat from the Earth from escaping to space) and warm the surface up. \n\nPlants play a vital role in the Earth system, converting carbon dioxide and water into sugars and oxygen (essential for life) during photosynthesis. They also absorb a range of pollutants on their surfaces and are planted in urban areas in part to reduce the levels of particulate matter. However, plants also release a cocktail of chemicals for a variety of reasons, e.g. attracting pollinators, defence against predators and protection against a variety of pollutants such as ozone. The hydroxyl radical (OH) is a species produced in the atmosphere that acts like a chemical detergent, mopping up pollutants and cleansing the atmosphere. It was believed that these chemicals released by plants suppressed the hydroxyl radical and therefore would increase the level of greenhouse gases. However, recent measurements of the level of OH in the tropics suggest that this idea is wrong and that these chemicals actually lead to OH recycling. \n\nIf this is correct then plants and in particular those in tropical regions, will be playing a significant role in off-setting climate change. If the recycling of OH is correct then these plant emissions are leading to a reduction in the amount of greenhouse gases present in the atmosphere.\nIn addition, it is believed that these emissions may also lead to aerosol species that will help to form cloud and further cool the planet. Therefore, this combination of effects could be extremely important to our understanding of the Earth's climate (past, present and future). It will also of course have important implications for forest ecosystems, the enhanced negative impact of deforestation in tropical regions and land-use strategies in general. \n\nA variety of scientists have speculated about how these chemicals may be leading to a recycling of OH, some based on laboratory experiments. However, the ones that appear to have the biggest potential impact and may resolve, at least in part, the discrepancy between measurements and computer simulations, are based on computer based calculations themselves. Therefore, it is vital that these theoretical studies be verified in the laboratory. These reactions are difficult to study and so we propose to add tags (swapping hydrogen for deuterium)to some of the chemicals we wish to study so that we can follow the reaction pathway more easily. We will use a range of detectors in concert with both a flow system and a static reaction chamber. Both systems will allow us to stufy different aspects of the chemical system. The detectors we will use include mass spectrometry (where we identify compounds by their weight) and spectroscopy (where we identify compounds by the amount of a specific colour of light that they absorb). These instruments have been developed at the two Universities involved (Bristol and Manchester) and allow them to be uniquely placed to be one of the few teams in the world able to carry out these studies.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/J009008/1","grantId":"NE/J009008/1","fundValue":"261418","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-09-30","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Dudley  Shallcross","coPersons":["Guy  Lloyd-Jones"],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
