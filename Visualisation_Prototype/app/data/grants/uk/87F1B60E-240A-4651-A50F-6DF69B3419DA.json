{"id":"87F1B60E-240A-4651-A50F-6DF69B3419DA","title":"Online Corpus of the Inscriptions of Ancient North Arabia","abstractText":"OCIANA aims to open up the history of ancient Arabia in the millennium before the rise of Islam: first, by publishing online a corpus of all known pre-Islamic inscriptions of ancient north and central Arabia which are at present extremely difficult to access even for the specialist; and second, by publishing research tools, monographs, journal articles, conference proceedings and theses which will demonstrate how this material radically corrects and deepens our understanding of all aspects of its history, languages and cultures.\nToday, our knowledge of the ancient history of Arabia is derived largely from external sources (Assyrian, Greek, Roman, etc.) or the often somewhat garbled accounts by historians in the Islamic period. Although excavations have taken place in the rest of the Middle East for more than 150 years, they have only been undertaken in the Gulf, Oman and Yemen for the last 60, and only in recent decades in Saudi Arabia which covers the major part of the Peninsula. Moreover, a significant section of the population in historical times has always been nomadic and the archaeology of nomadic societies has not yet begun in Arabia.\nHowever, we have another rich source of information. For Arabia was unique in the ancient world in that while literacy was widespread among the settled populations it was apparently almost universal among the nomads. Between the mid-1st millennium BC and the 4th century AD these nomads covered the rocks of the Syro-Arabian deserts with tens of thousands of graffiti. These give us a vivid picture of their way-of-life, social structures, personal emotions, and relations with each other and with the settled peoples of Arabia and beyond (Romans, Jews, Nabataeans, etc.), information which is almost entirely lacking for Middle Eastern nomads at any other period. These, with the monumental inscriptions and graffiti of the settled peoples, are the only indigenous written sources we have for the ancient history of most of Arabia.\nThese texts are the only source for a group of dialects known as Ancient North Arabian (ANA) which are related to Arabic but distinct from it, and are written in alphabets unique to Arabia. In addition to the historical information they contain, they are of fundamental importance for Comparative Semitics, the history of the alphabet, and the study of ancient literacy. While they provide the key to understanding ancient Arabia, they are also an important source for the ancient Near East in general. For Arabia was geographically and strategically central to the region, and its peoples had links from Anatolia to Ethiopia and from the Mediterranean to India, through the lucrative trade in Arabian frankincense and luxury goods from across the Indian Ocean.\nThe study of these texts has a distinguished history but they are now very difficult to access since they are scattered in numerous books, articles and unpublished theses, with no research tools. As a result of this and other factors, the history, languages and cultures of ancient Arabia are no longer taught at any university in Europe or North America, at a time when scholars in many different fields are showing an ever increasing interest in them. OCIANA will reverse this situation by making this treasure-house of material readily available by: (1) creating in 2 stages an easily updatable, online corpus of the approximately 48,000 ANA texts known so far; (2) producing a large range of online, easily updatable, research tools from the texts in OCIANA; (3) training 2 post-doctoral researchers and a doctoral student in ANA epigraphy and the languages, history and cultures of ancient Arabia; (4) enabling them to make international contacts through the project's partnerships, workshop and conference. Thus, while holding posts in Arabic, Semitics, ancient Near Eastern history or other fields they will be able to continue research on ancient Arabia and, it is hoped, eventually restore the subject to university curricula.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/K00316X/1","grantId":"AH/K00316X/1","fundValue":"701074","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2017-03-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  After thirteen months, the preliminary results of the OCIANA Project are being used in two main areas. First and foremost, they have contributed significantly to research and teaching about the languages and cultures of North Arabia before Islam across of range of disciplines from archaeology and history to comparative Semitic studies. In particular, the as yet incomplete database of Safaitic inscriptions has enabled Dr Ahmad al-Jallad (University of Leiden) to produce the first grammar of Safaitic, which will become an indispensable tool for the teaching of ancient North Arabian languages. In addition, three of his research students have embarked upon doctoral theses which will both use and contribute to the Safaitic database. Second, the dissemination of greater knowledge about the languages and cultures of pre-Islamic North Arabia assists the governments of the region, principally Jordan and Saudi Arabia in the development of cultural heritage management and tourism policies. The OCIANA Project team collaborate closely with the Department of Antiquities of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, and several employees and ex-employees of the Department are contributors of data to the OCIANA. In July 2014, Dr Ali al-Ghabban, Vice President of the Saudi Commission for Tourism and Antiquities, visited the OCIANA Project in Oxford, with a view to extending co-operation between the Project and the Commission.

That said, as reported under 'Research Databases', we are well advanced (and, indeed, ahead of schedule) in the entry of the corpora of Safaitic and Dadanitic inscriptions into the database. Most importantly, the imminent publication of the first grammar of Safaitic (see A.M. al-Jallad, An Outline of the Grammar of the Safaitic Inscriptions, Brill: Leiden, forthcoming spring 2015, under 'Publications'), which could not have been written without the as yet incomplete database of Safaitic inscriptions is a ground-breaking development. Comparably revolutionary developments will be made possible in Spring 2015 when data entry of the Safaitic and Dadanitic corpora will be complete, at which point the tools for study of the prosopography and social organisation, and of the philology of pre-Islamic North Arabia will be transformed. Early in 2015, with the completion and public launch of the databases of Safaitic and Dadanitic inscriptions within the OCIANA, it will for the first time become possible for scholars in all disciplines to access and interrogate the great majority of the sole autochthonous sources for Northern Arabia before the coming of Islam. At about the same time, with the publication of al-Jallad's grammar of Safaitic, the study of the linguistics and philology of one of the North Arabian 'dialects' -- a close ancestor of classical and thence modern Arabic -- will be put on an entirely new footing. In addition, the collection of a massive corpus of data recording the location and distribution of these inscriptions will provide the authorities responsible for the protection of antiquities and the development of tourism in the various modern states of Northern Arabia with a new resource for cultural heritage management.
