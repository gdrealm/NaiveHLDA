{"id":"9FFDD6A2-804E-4642-94FC-842EDC014579","title":"Boiling in Microchannels: integrated design of closed-loop cooling system for devices operating at high heat fluxes","abstractText":"Current developments and future trends in small-scale devices used in a variety of industries such as electronic equipment and micro-process and refrigeration systems, place an increasing demand for removing higher thermal loads from small areas. In some cases further developments are simply not possible unless the problem of providing adequate cooling is resolved. The progression from air to liquid and specifically flow boiling to transfer the high heat fluxes generated is thus the only possible way forward. Evaporative cooling can, not only transfer these loads but also offer greater temperature uniformity since the working fluid can be (in a carefully designed system) at a constant saturation temperature. The consideration of microchannel flow boiling processes has been made possible by developments in microfabrication techniques both in metals and substances such as silicon. However, there still remain fundamental fluid flow and heat transfer related questions that need to be addressed before a wider use of these micro heat exchangers is possible in industry. The specific challenges that will be researched - both fundamental and practical in nature - include flow instabilities and mal-distribution which are the result of interaction between the system manifolds and the external circuit. These can lead to flow reversal and dry-out in the heat exchanger with subsequent drastic reduction in heat transfer rates. The understanding of the fundamental physical phenomena and their relevance to industrial designs is one of the focal points and constitutes one of the major challenges of the proposed research. The effect of other parameters such as inlet sub-cooling, which again relates not only to the micro-heat exchanger itself but also to the overall design, will be addressed along with material/surface characteristics through the use of both metallic and silicon microchannels. \n\nThe work proposed will include carefully contacted detailed experiments measuring relevant parameters such as local heat flux, temperature and pressure combined with flow visualization through industrially available and purposely developed and manufactured sensors. The research teams will not only develop or adapt advanced instruments for accurate measurements at these small scales but also develop new three-dimensional numerical tools capable of capturing the extremely complex physical phenomena at, for example the triple-line (vapour-liquid-solid). These techniques will not only help elucidate the current phenomena but can find wide application in similar research, both in thermal and biomedical flows.\n\nThe proposal brings together two teams of academics working both in microfabrication/sensors and two-phase flow supported by industry (Thermacore, Selex Galileo, Sustainable Engine Systems and Rainford Precision) to tackle some of the key fundamental challenges that will enable a wider adoption of this cooling method hence meeting current and future needs in the industry. The proposed research will also have a wider impact on energy conservation and environmental footprint trough, for example, more efficient thermal management of data/supercomputing centres around the world that can lead to a reduction in energy consumption and reuse of heat that would otherwise be rejected.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K011502/1","grantId":"EP/K011502/1","fundValue":"419132","fundStart":"2013-05-01","fundEnd":"2016-10-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"T  Karayiannis","coPersons":["Kai  Cheng","David  Kenning"],"organisation":"Brunel University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
