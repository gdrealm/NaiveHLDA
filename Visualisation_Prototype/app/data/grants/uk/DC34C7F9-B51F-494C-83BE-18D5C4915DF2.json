{"id":"DC34C7F9-B51F-494C-83BE-18D5C4915DF2","title":"Valuing Intangibles: Ranking Brands, Measuring Trade Mark Use","abstractText":"<p>Brands are names, phrases, symbols or designs that identify particular products, which are often protected by trade marks. Trade marks help owners protect their reputation by forbidding use of their brand name by others.</p>\n\n<p>Trade marks are usually registered, but not all registered marks are used. Much litigation arises over the extent of use and reputation of marks, which often results in costly surveys being run.</p>\n\n<p>This project aims to improve the measurement of brand value and the measurement of trade mark use by combining data from trade mark registers and data from Google's search products. Data from Google's search products can be used to measure value and use of marks. In using these data two important challenges must be overcome: heterogeneity of the data and attempts to manipulate the measures obtained. Both challenges will be addressed in the project.</p>\n\n<p>Data on search are heterogeneous because the reasons for searches are heterogeneous, they may reflect positive or negative brand interest. Additionally, attempts to manipulate Google's rankings of websites though the PageRank link analysis algorithm are legion. To overcome both problems we will consider ways of limiting search terms to obtain consistent measures of value from Google's search products.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K007807/1","grantId":"ES/K007807/1","fundValue":"99427","fundStart":"2013-05-31","fundEnd":"2014-11-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Morten  Hviid","coPersons":["Georg  Von Graevenitz","Christian  Helmers"],"organisation":"University of East Anglia","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
