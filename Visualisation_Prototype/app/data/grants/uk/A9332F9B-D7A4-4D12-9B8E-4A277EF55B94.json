Meromorphic functions are functions that are differentiable throughout the complex plane except possibly at isolated points where the functions may have the simplest kind of singularities, called poles. Such functions arise naturally in many theoretical and practical problems. Britain has a strong tradition of research in function theory. Among its particular strengths are Nevanlinna's value distribution theory for meromorphic functions of a single variable, as well as the study of dynamical systems. However, during the last couple of decades there have been major breakthroughs in Nevanlinna theory and related areas which appear to have had little impact in Britain to date. Funds are sought to run a series of small workshops that are aimed at engaging the UK community with some of these important lines of research. The emphasis of the workshops will be on exploring collaborations and the number of talks will be restricted accordingly.Below are brief descriptions of each proposed workshop.W1. Frontiers of Nevanlinna theoryThis will be a general introduction to the main themes.W2. Nevanlinna theory and Diophantine approximationThis workshop will explore the remarkable formal connection between Nevanlinna theory and an area of number theory. Participants will be invited who work on this connection as well as those working in pure Nevanlinna theory or Diophantine approximation.W3. Function theory and dynamical systems over p-adic spacesFor each prime number p, the p-adic numbers are a field of numbers that contain the rational numbers (fractions) but are quite different in nature to the real numbers. They arise naturally in many problems in number theory. One can also construct analogues of the complex numbers in the p-adic setting and develop large parts of complex analysis, including Nevanlinna theory. Recently there has been a lot of interest in the behaviour of dynamical systems in the p-adic setting. Classical Nevanlinna theory has been a useful tool in dynamical systems over the (genuine) complex numbers. This workshop will explore this connection over the p-adics.W4. Function theory of differential and difference equationsThere are several important conjectures concerning differential and difference equations in the complex domain for which Nevanlinna theory would be a useful tool.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I013334/1","grantId":"EP/I013334/1","fundValue":"24273","fundStart":"2010-09-01","fundEnd":"2012-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Rodney George Halburd","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":" This was a very fruitful series of four workshops, each of which concentrated on a connection between Nevanlinna theory and other areas of mathematics. The first meeting was an overview of the main themes. The second meeting explored p-adic Nevanlinna theory and arithmetic dynamics. In the third meeting, applications of Nevanlinna theory to differential and difference equations were studied.
