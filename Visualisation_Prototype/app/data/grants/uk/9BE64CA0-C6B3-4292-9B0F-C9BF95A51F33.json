{"id":"9BE64CA0-C6B3-4292-9B0F-C9BF95A51F33","title":"Cucurbitrils for Hardwired Optical and Electronic Self-assembly","abstractText":"We aim to grow specific-sized metal and semiconductor nanoparticles inside rigid molecular cages called cucurbiturils, and subsequently assemble them into functional nano-chains. Combining these filled cages with well-defined connector molecules allows us to precisely define particle geometries, particle separations and particle interfacing. This in turn enables the robust construction of plasmonic optical antennae at visible wavelengths, room-temperature single-electron-tunnelling transistors and combined photovoltaics. Such functional properties open up novel alternative methods for directed assembly using irradiation with precisely-tuned lasers, nano-electrochemistry or ac-electric fields. This approach will constitute the basis of a new nanotechnology platform for organic-inorganic ordered nano-composites.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H007024/1","grantId":"EP/H007024/1","fundValue":"382461","fundStart":"2009-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-03-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  We have developed new technologies for sensing.
