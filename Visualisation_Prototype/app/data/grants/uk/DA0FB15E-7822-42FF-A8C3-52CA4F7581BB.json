Present methods for the detection of explosives leave much to be desired. To allow analysis to occur in the 'field' there is an urgent need for the development of on-site testing. There is also a need to detect explosives pollution on military sites. Toxic explosives residues are released into the environment on military training ranges as a result of incomplete detonation of munitions. As ecplosives are toxic it is therefore essential that the MoD consider the fate and transport mechanisms and the subsequent impact of these materials on the terrestrial environment. The availability of benchmark data regarding the transport and fate of the energetic materials will support predictions and modeling to enable the MoD to use best management practices for the stewardship of military sites. The results obtained will provide potential cost savings, since such knowledge will mitigate contamination and alleviate the need for future clean-up operations.\n\nTo address these challenge, we are aiming to develop novel inexpensive sensors to rapidly and effectively detect explosives. We intend to construct a proof-of-principle cell-based sensor where the cells specifically respond to the explosive TNT and produce a signal that is detected by an optical device. This requires engineering a genetic regulatory protein that specifically binds TNT. The TNT bound regulatory complex then binds to the promoter region of a reporter gene resulting in the expression of an enzyme alkaline phosphatase which is secreted out of the microbial cell. The secreted enzyme then activates a fluorescent compound and this signal is then detected using an optical waveguide sensor. The development of a genetic regulatory element that specifically recognises explosives would result in a step-change towards the development of a biosensor with strong relevance to the security and defence area.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/J019895/1","grantId":"BB/J019895/1","fundValue":"74484","fundStart":"2012-12-31","fundEnd":"2014-03-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Neil  Bruce","coPersons":["Susan Jane Rosser"],"organisation":"University of York","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
