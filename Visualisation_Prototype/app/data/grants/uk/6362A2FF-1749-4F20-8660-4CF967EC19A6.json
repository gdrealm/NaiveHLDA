{"id":"6362A2FF-1749-4F20-8660-4CF967EC19A6","title":"Fascin-dependent control of nuclear plasticity in invading cells","abstractText":"Many clinical studies have identified a protein called fascin at high levels in human breast cancers, however very little is known about how this protein is controlled. This project aims to study the factors that control fascin and how this protein can promote movement of breast cancer cells away from primary tumours and into distant sites of metastases. One of the major gaps in current knowledge is a detailed understanding of the factors regulating breast cancer progression and metastasis. This project will help to identify new proteins that can lead to increased cancer cell invasion and therefore provide new possible targets for designing future treatments. This project aims to study the factors that control fascin function in breast cancer cells with the long-term aim of disrupting this controlling factor and preventing cancer cell invasion. We will use human breast cancer cells in the lab to study the different proteins that are responsible for promoting the invasion of these cells into tissue-like environments. We will then use different strategies to inhibit these newly identified invasion-promoting proteins. Ultimately this study could lead to the identification of new proteins that cause increased breast cancer invasion into tissues. This is very valuable information in the design and development of new drugs and therapeutic agents to prevent breast cancer metastasis.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/J000647/1","grantId":"MR/J000647/1","fundValue":"363829","fundStart":"2012-02-01","fundEnd":"2015-01-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Madeline  Parsons","coPersons":[],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
