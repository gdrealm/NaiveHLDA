{"id":"DB112CF2-F8A0-437F-93C4-9B68DBF7A494","title":"Ethnography of Penal Policy","abstractText":"This study traces human rights and managerialist discourses as they inform, interact and are translated into on-the-ground knowledge and action in the penal system. The substantive aim is twofold: to illuminate the process by which these discourses are readied for application as policies, and to present a detailed account of the settings of penal policy making. The research design flows from this interest in accounting for discourse and practice by combining ethnographic study of key sites of penal policy and research offices with metaphor analysis of the administrative texts produced in this environment to capture the process of governance in action. The choice of ethnography here is holistic, taking into account people, materials and practices as these play out in real time and in their ‘natural environment’, and thus the study aspires to be an anthropology of policy.\n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2881","grantId":"RES-000-22-2881","fundValue":"81667","fundStart":"2008-09-09","fundEnd":"2010-09-08","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Sarah Carlson Armstrong","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
