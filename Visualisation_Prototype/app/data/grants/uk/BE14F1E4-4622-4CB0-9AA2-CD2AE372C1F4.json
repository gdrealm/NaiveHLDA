{"id":"BE14F1E4-4622-4CB0-9AA2-CD2AE372C1F4","title":"Astrophysics at Keele: the formation and evolution of galaxies, stars and planets","abstractText":"In understanding our place in the universe we need to know how many planets there are, how planetary systems form and evolve, and how many of them are like our Solar System, possibly harbouring life. The best way of studying planets is to find the ones that pass in front of (&quot;transit&quot;) their star. By looking for the tiny dips in a star's light caused by a transiting planet, Keele's WASP-South survey has found more transiting planets than anyone else in the Southern hemisphere, and is using them to answer questions about how planetary systems form. \n\nPlanets form around young stars, and star and planet formation are intimately connected. Keele will process the data from a very large survey of young stars and clusters of stars, using spectra obtained by ESO's Very Large Telescope, to combine with the unprecedented astrometry soon to be obtained by ESA's Gaia mission. The combination will provide the biggest survey yet of how stars and stellar clusters form and evolve. \n\nThe two Magellanic Clouds are the two galaxies closest to our own, so close that they interact with our galaxy, providing an excellent opportunity to study how galaxies affect each other, with collisions and mergers thought to be important factors in explaining galaxies today. Keele's role in the new-generation radio survey of the Magellanic Clouds provided by the GASKAP project will provide the most detailed yet picture of the dynamics and interactions of our Milky way with these two satellite galaxies. \n\nAt the cores of galaxies, supermassive black holes can grow by sucking in material from their surroundings. It is now realised that powerful winds generated by the swirling around a black hole can both regulate the growth of the black hole and affect the future evolution of the whole galaxy. A Keele-led program using the latest X-ray satellites studies the X-ray emission generated by the extreme gravity of the black hole to study the black-hole winds and their affect on their environment.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/J001384/1","grantId":"ST/J001384/1","fundValue":"1048700","fundStart":"2012-04-01","fundEnd":"2015-12-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Coel  Hellier","coPersons":["James  Reeves","John Kevin Taylor (Southworth)","Robin David Jeffries","Jacobus Theodorus  Van Loon"],"organisation":"Keele University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
