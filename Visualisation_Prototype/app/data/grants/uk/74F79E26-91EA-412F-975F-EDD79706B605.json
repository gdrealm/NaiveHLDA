The past approach was that of single species management, devoid of many environmental aspects, and without direct input from the fishing industry. That approach has been found wanting with many stocks fished at unsustainable levels. The way forward has been to recognise that we need to manage using an ecosystem based approach while at the same time maintaining direct interaction with the fishing industry in management decisions. Such an ecosystem approach requires a more mechanistic understanding of the role the physical environment plays whilst also taking into account multiple species interactions. It is also clear, as more demand is put upon the space use of our marine systems (i.e. offshore renewable developments, Marine Protected Areas and fishing effort becomes managed more on a spatial basis), a better understanding of the role of marine habitat is essential. This is particular difficult as marine habitat can move in both space and time. However, any fisherman can tell you that there are some locations (and times) that are almost always better than others for good catches. The understanding as to why that may be is a fundamental challenge. In earlier studies involving both the PI and Co-PI, in the North and Celtic Seas, we have found that in locations where there are disproportionately high numbers of seabirds, marine mammals or fishing effort, there are also spatially limited patches of high levels of sub-surface primary production. The patches appear to be associated with topographically-driven internal waves whose physical effects may be responsible for localised increases of primary production and the physical aggregation of smaller marine organisms. Therefore these features could be responsible for the predicable areas of foraging due to complex links in the entire food web (Hypothesis A) or just enhance the ability of predators to capture prey (fish) in these locations (Hypothesis B). The sub-surface signature of these areas has meant that they have been overlooked in studies which have identified important surface features, such as thermal fronts, known to contain aggregations of many marine species. These patches therefore represent a newly-identified class of spatially important locations in shallow seas. In this project we propose to test between Hypothesis A &amp; B using a new survey framework that incorporates all of those factors and defines the critical characteristics of the marine habitat where multi-species (predator-prey) interactions and fisheries operations are more likely to occur. This survey framework is based, to some degree, on the tried and tested method that fishermen have used for centuries: i.e. to observe seabird and marine mammal behaviour as a guide to locations of fishing grounds. Our aim is to take that practice forward with a multi-disciplinary approach between marine ecologists (U. Aberdeen), biological and physical oceanographers (POL), statutory agencies (FRS, CEFAS, JNCC) as well as fishermen (CFPO) and a range of skilled marine animal and fisheries observers (JNCC, MRAG). This project also represents a unique opportunity, to more fully utilise a NERC Oceans2025 Project. In this interdisciplinary approach we will combine the continuous physical and biological oceanographic features that will be studied in the Oceans2025 program with the additional collection of acoustic sonar backscatter, visual observations of seabirds and marine mammals, vocalisations of cetaceans, fishery observations, and longer term fisheries and marine animal survey data. With these combined data products, we will identify and define the characteristics of these sub-surface patches and the bio-physical mechanisms that may lead to the facilitation of predator-prey interactions. This research will greatly enhance the type of mechanistic understanding needed for implementing the ecosystem approach to sustainable fisheries management.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/F001983/1","grantId":"NE/F001983/1","fundValue":"221631","fundStart":"2008-01-01","fundEnd":"2010-12-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  This research has increased the level of certainty that the foraging habitats of mobile marine species can be predicted using a range of seasonal and static bio-physical characteristics.

It also allows predictions of efficiency of trophic transfer in future climates.

It is essential to have a detailed understanding of how the motion and physical properties of seawater (physical oceanography) influence the biological productivity of the oceans, whether plankton (the microscopic life in the ocean), fish, seabirds or even fishermen. Any fisherman will tell you that there are some locations and times that consistently produce areas with large catches. Often these areas are located by fishing where there are large numbers of feeding seabirds or marine mammals. This co- location of many marine animals in space and time indicate that these areas are extremely ecologically important and are the limited locations where multiple levels of predator-prey interactions occur. Understanding and defining the spatial and temporal nature of these critical marine habitats is a fundamental challenge.\nOur research in the North Sea suggested that areas of critical marine habitat (i.e. locations with lots of feeding seabirds &amp; marine mammals) are associated with high levels of sub-surface primary production (i.e. planktonic plants) possibly driven by internal waves (underwater waves) which greatly increases local mixing. Internal waves are created by the combination of tidal currents, a stratified water column (where sun-warmed water separates out from colder deeper water) and the steepness of bank edges. The sub-surface signature of these areas has meant that they are not easily identified and ways to identify and define them are urgently needed. \n\nOur first aim was to determine the exact physical role of seabed topography in creating internal waves and what conditions were needed for high predator-prey aggregations. Our second aim was to test innovative new repeated circular and 'on the spot' survey method that re-sampled the same area of predator-prey interaction at different tidal speeds in regions of contrasting topography; a steep bank and a flat site. Both surveys used acoustic and oceanographic instruments to record changes in physical and behavioural aspects, second by second.\n\nThe findings of the project are of significant interest. Where circular surveys were deployed in the North Sea, the main prey species, sand-eels, clearly modified their schooling behaviour with changes in the tidal speeds. As the water reaches maximum speeds the fish move higher in the water column, grouping themselves together in large numbers of shoals. This suggests that increased tidal speeds not only create large prey aggregations, but also increase the probability of interaction with predators (such as surface-feeding birds like kittiwakes) by drawing them towards the surface.\n\nResults from the Celtic Sea surveys, focusing on increases in primary production suggest that higher turbulence affected the abundance of planktonic algae species and that tidal currents export this increased production to a much larger area around a bank. Evidence from both a sub-sea camera and fishing vessels showed that the fish species richness was higher on the bank than the flat sites even though there was only a 15 km difference between these locations. Internal waves were found in only one location on the bank and feeding gannets targeted this exact location which confirms that visible top predators are using aspects of internal wave activity. These combined results have direct implications for the definition and the spatial scale of what constitutes a 'critical habitat' for marine species.\nThis project has provided information linking fish distributions on a fine scale with the physical and biological environment which will allow more certainty in marine spatial management of fishing as well as increased certainty in the selection and location of SPA and SACs and the design of MPAs Marine spatial planning and MPAs: Marine spatial planning and the design of MPAs can only precede with certainty by understanding, in detail, the critically important spatial needs of marine animals. These results are needed by JNCC to underpin the advice they give to the nature conservation agencies about the selection and location of Special Protection Areas in the marine environment for seabirds, as required under the EU Birds Directive. \n\n'Blue skies' - Ecological theory and analytical ad Education,Energy,Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice","dataset":"gtr"}
