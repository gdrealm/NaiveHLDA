{"id":"E1BD941E-FE73-451B-BB3E-9977E730A676","title":"Co-ordinating the transition from egg to embryo in mammals","abstractText":"The egg drives the process of early embryo development. As such understanding how we produce a healthy egg is of fundamental importance to reproductive success. The trigger that switches the egg along the path of embryo development is an explosive release of Ca2+ that is started when the sperm fuses with the egg. This Ca2+ signal needs to co-ordinate a series of events, including exit from an arrested state, an increase in metabolism and the release of granules from the egg that serve to prevent extra sperm fertilizing the egg. In this research proposal we will use fluorescent light to follow these processes in single living mouse eggs and embryos. This research will provide an understanding of how the egg turns into an embryo and what happens when this process goes wrong. We will communicate this research through scientific literature but also through the respective PR departments at UCL and the MRC.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0400530","grantId":"G0400530","fundValue":"1086790","fundStart":"2005-04-01","fundEnd":"2011-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"John  Carroll","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
