One of the key forms in which this aggregation occurs is the so-called amyloid fibril, a very regular packing of the molecules into long fibrils containing a significant amount of beta sheet. These fibrils are implicated in many of the diseases of old age and neurodegeneration, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. However, this same structure is also found in benign situations, such as when milk proteins are heat-treated to lead to texture in foods such as yogurt and cheese. The amyloid fibril is not the only form of aggregate that can occur, and recent studies have identified suprafibrillar aggregates known as spherulites. These have also been found in diseased brain tissue, and are also known to form in the milk proteins. This project aims to try to uncover the factors that control when and how these different aggregates form, and what determines the balance between them. By working on model proteins such as insulin and Abeta (the protein associated with Alzheimer's disease) we aim to explore the role of the charge state of the protein and the presence of surfaces. The relevant surfaces include the introduction of nanoparticles as well as more macroscopic surfaces. Understanding the impact of nanoparticles for protein aggregation is another major thrust in healthcare which this project may help to address. If nanoparticles are shown to promote protein aggregation these studies will have far reaching implications for the cytotoxicity and toxicology of nanomaterials.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H004939/1","grantId":"EP/H004939/1","fundValue":"347097","fundStart":"2009-11-09","fundEnd":"2012-11-08","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  To inform further studies of relaxations in thin polymer films Other Societal","person":"James Sinclair Sharp","coPersons":["Clive  Roberts"],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":" This project has shown that environmental factors such as pH, temperature and protein concentration influence the balance between amyloids fibrils and spherulites druing the aggregation of proteins. In particular we have shown that the size and number of spherulites formed is sensitive to pH and temperature. The observed behaviour has been interpreted in terms of the colloidal and conformational stability of proteins. \n\nUnder certain conditions it is possible to form giant amyloid spherulites which have diameters as large as 1mm. When viewed under cross polarisers these aggregates display a rich variety of colours or isochromes. We have developed a theoretical model which allows us to predict the shapes of the isochromes that form and to obtain information about the internal structure of the protein aggregates.\n\nIn addition, we have also developed a simple processing based method for the manufacture of organic photonic structures. We have performed detailed measurements of crack pattern formation in thin colloidal films. We have also derived a theory which explains how the confining influence of a substrate influences these patterns. \n\nStudies of droplet vibration have also allowed us to develop a technique for measuring the surface tension and viscosity of small liquid volumes. Understanding how environmental factors influence the final morphology of protein aggregates is important in determining how to treat diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. Studies of the structural properties of amyloid spherulites are also important for extracting information about the molecular level assembly processes that take place during the formation of these harmful aggregates. These studies will therefore act to inform researchers and health care professionals so that a Energy,Healthcare","dataset":"gtr"}
