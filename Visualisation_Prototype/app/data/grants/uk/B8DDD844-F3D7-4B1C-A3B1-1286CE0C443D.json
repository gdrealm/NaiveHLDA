Received images of conventional warfare, based on highly organised and trained forces in the Second World War, have become outmoded. Both the actors in contemporary warfare and changing technological capabilities fundamentally challenge existing international law on the use of armed force involving some degree of kinetic force - that is, energy transfer through blast and fragmentation. New technical means, including cyber-technology, space warfare, electronic warfare, drone warfare, modes of sabotage, and weapons of mass destruction - nuclear, radiological, chemical or biological (or synthetic biological) and their potential application and exploitation cannot easily be accommodated within the existing legal framework, if at all. Similarly, while states remain central, there is no war, obvious or non-obvious, which does not involve non-state actors, (including Private Military Security Companies, coalitions and insurgents).</p>\n\n<p>The project investigates the legal and ethical dimensions of scientific and technical innovation, identifying the range of scientific and technical innovations that present the greatest challenges in terms of international humanitarian and international human rights law in both obvious and non-obvious warfare.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K011413/1","grantId":"ES/K011413/1","fundValue":"239399","fundStart":"2013-05-31","fundEnd":"2015-01-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Guglielmo  Verdirame","coPersons":["Andrew JAMES Gow","Rachel Clare Kerr"],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
