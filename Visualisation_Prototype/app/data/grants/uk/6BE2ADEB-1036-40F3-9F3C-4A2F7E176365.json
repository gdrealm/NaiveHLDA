Just as ultrasound is used to see the face of a foetus before it is born, astronomers can 'see' inside the stars by studying their light variations caused by pulsations within them. This research will provide unprecedent 3D views of the pulsation modes and abundance distributions in the rapidly oscillating peculiar A stars.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/F002203/1","grantId":"ST/F002203/1","fundValue":"241105","fundStart":"2008-08-01","fundEnd":"2011-07-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Donald Wayne Kurtz","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Central Lancashire","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
