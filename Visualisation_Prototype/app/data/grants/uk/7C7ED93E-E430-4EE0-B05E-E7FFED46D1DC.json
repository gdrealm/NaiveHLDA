Ecosystems are important not only to the biogeochemical cycles of the ocean and the life within it, but also to the atmosphere, in particular through greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and climatically active gases such as dimethyl sulphide (DMS). Knowledge of and a predictive capability for marine ecosystem processes is crucial to the ecosystem approach to marine management and sustainable fisheries management. We propose a programme of workshop activities aimed at helping the development of improved descriptions of marine ecology, suited for the next generation of both marine and Earth system models. We will compare and contrast approaches already under study in the UK, with those being implemented by the international community. Particular effort will be put into (1) The response of planktonic organisms to high levels of CO2, (2) the representation of plankton functional types for marine ecosystems, (3) bridging the gap between lower and higher trophic levels (4) biogas production in the upper ocean, (5) operational biophysical oceanography. Additionally we will organize an international symposium bringing together all aspects of marine ecosystem modelling. The programme takes advantage of an existing initiative, and will improve the links between the UK community and international interests in this area and making it more cohesive, coordinated and efficient in its exploitation of synergies.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/D521830/1","grantId":"NE/D521830/1","fundValue":"129046","fundStart":"2006-02-01","fundEnd":"2009-07-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  AMEMR continues to provide a forum for international marine ecosystem modelling community to meet and discuss progress in the field.
