An important line of enquiry concerns the factors that influence whether and when an unemployed individual exits unemployment. According to job search theory, an individual exits unemployment once he/she receives a wage offer equal to or in excess of his/her reservation wage, which is defined as the lowest wage at which an individual is willing to work. Hence, the level of the reservation wage is crucial in the transition from unemployment to employment. An individual's reservation wage may be influenced by a variety of factors such as the level of unemployment benefit, childcare costs or the length of the unemployment spell as well as personal characteristics such as educational attainment and household factors such as wealth and income. </p> \n<p>The objectives of our empirical study are </p> \n<ul> \n <li>Ascertain what determines an individualâ€™s reservation wage</li> \n <li>Explore how realistic reservation wages are relative to actual wages</li> \n <li>Ascertain the extent to which reservation wages influence the likelihood of leaving unemployment. </li>\n</ul> \n<p>To attain these objectives, we will analyse individual level data from the British Household Panel Surveys covering the period 1991-2004.<br /></p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2004","grantId":"RES-000-22-2004","fundValue":"79624","fundStart":"2007-03-01","fundEnd":"2008-04-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Karl  Taylor","coPersons":["Sarah  Brown"],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
