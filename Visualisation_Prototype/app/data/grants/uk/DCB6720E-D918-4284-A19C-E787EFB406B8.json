In relation to this, the acceptability to people in Britain of energy sources is critical.&nbsp; This research will conduct a large nationwide quantitative survey (n=2,275 across England, Scotland and Wales) to examine public perceptions of climate change and various energy options.&nbsp; The survey aims to examine how these perceptions have changed since previous evaluations but also has a theoretical goal of examining how context influences perceptions.&nbsp; Context will be examined in a number of ways including how location impacts peoplesâ€™ perceptions: for example, does having personal experience of the recent flooding change beliefs? In addition, the significance of whether people consider climate change and energy issues in terms of themselves personally or in terms of society as a whole will be explored, as well as how awareness of other issues such as energy security influences perceptions.&nbsp; Survey results will provide a better understanding of what public perceptions are, as well as how they are structured, how stable these are, and how they may change in the future. Findings will be of significant interest to policy makers, business, environmental groups, and others interested in communicating about climate change.<br /> </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-1134","grantId":"RES-062-23-1134","fundValue":"314177","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Nicholas  Pidgeon","coPersons":["Wouter  Poortinga","Alexa  Spence"],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
