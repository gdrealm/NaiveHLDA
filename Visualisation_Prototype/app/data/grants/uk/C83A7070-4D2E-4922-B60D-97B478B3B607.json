{"id":"C83A7070-4D2E-4922-B60D-97B478B3B607","title":"Governing post-suburban growth: Planning and Politics of post-suburbia","abstractText":"This research will explore the value of the term 'post-suburbia' to account for the growth, planning and politics of settlements in varying degrees of proximity to Beijing, Helsinki, London, Madrid, Moscow and Washington DC. Post suburbia is a term that has been used to speak to recent trends within which new patterns of urbanisation resemble cities in function but not in form. The original research will examine the range of actors involved in, and any distinctive coalitions of actors driving, the growth of these post-suburban settlements. It will also examine the local politics surrounding these settlements in terms of dilemmas regarding (i) growth versus conservation, (ii) growth versus provision for collective consumption (in the form of schools, community facilities, amenities and transport infrastructure) and (iii), administrative arrangements (in terms of pressures for amalgamation or secession).&nbsp; The research is also scheduled to incorporate a mini-conference to be held at UCL, most likely in early summer, with invited speakers, drawn from the United States, Europe and Asia as well as interested planning and economic development practitioners. It is hoped that the research can help address a number of important questions over what is distinctively post-about post-suburbia; notably questions over its diversity, its novelty, its predominant function and land uses, and how to delimit it geographically.\n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-0924","grantId":"RES-062-23-0924","fundValue":"161353","fundStart":"2008-04-01","fundEnd":"2009-07-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Nicholas Alfred Phelps","coPersons":["Fulong  Wu"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
