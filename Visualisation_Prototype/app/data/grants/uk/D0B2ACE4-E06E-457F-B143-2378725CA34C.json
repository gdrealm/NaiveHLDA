An early secondment of CAS staff to S&atilde;o Paulo followed by a broad kick-off workshop will be used to initiate the scoping study. Potential UK activities at various stages of development will be drawn into a broader strategy of International collaboration and opportunities for further consortium scale activities will be developed. A UK office for collaboration on Amazonian atmospheric research will be established at the University of Manchester. The long-term particulate monitoring programme within AEROCLIMA will be expanded to include online aerosol composition measurements at the pristine rainforest site. Secondment of S&atilde;o Paulo staff to CAS will ensure adequate training is provided in the operation of the instrumentation, data analysis and quality control. A pump-priming pilot scale intensive deployment of the CAS container laboratory with additional particulate measurement instrumentation will be used to i) validate the long-term measurements, ii) quantitatively interpret the impacts of aerosol composition on physical properties of climate relevance in the context of the long-term variability, iii) act as a focal measurement suite around which a broader consortium-scale activity can be developed. A strategy for the medium and longer term collaborative efforts will be developed based on the initial scoping study and consultation throughout the UK research community. This strategy will be consolidated into a White Paper outlining the Brazil-UK collaborative opportunities and recommended participation of UK groups in Amazonian atmospheric research.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/I030178/1","grantId":"NE/I030178/1","fundValue":"239988","fundStart":"2012-03-31","fundEnd":"2014-09-30","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Gordon Bruce McFiggans","coPersons":["Hugh  Coe","James Donald Allan"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":" The BUNIAACIC collaboration is developing a coherent strategy for UK studies of atmospheric composition and impacts in the Amazon.\n\n\n\nIt was intended to address a number of immediate short-timescale material objectives, as follows:\n\n\n\ni) skill development and knowledge exchange through training in instrument operation and data analysis for University of S&atilde;o Paulo AMS operators, hence;\n\n\n\nii) enhancement of long-term aerosol property data delivery through online particle composition measurements;\n\n\n\nThese first of these objectives have been addressed and the second anabled by an intensive training activity performed at the ground-based monitoring station at Porto Velho, coinciding with the international SAMBBA biomass burning field project deployment. BUNIAACIC is a joint FAPESP-NERC initiative and our partners in the programme at the University of S&atilde;o Paulo had just taken delivery of the first of the Aerosol Chemical Speciation Monitors (ACSM) in Brazil. Our most experienced Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (AMS) operator has provided training in operational and data analytical skills for the simpler ACSM instrument throughout the month of September, 2012. Continued long-term deployment of the first ACSM and expansion to include 2 further instruments is in the process of fully delivering on objective ii)\n\n\n\niii) evaluation of the performance of the long-term monitoring instrument through comparison with intensive measurement by additional instrumentation;\n\n\n\niv) intensive measurements of additional aerosol properties for direct linkage between aerosol composition and optical / microphysical properties;\n\n\n\nv) quantification of the impact of measured BSOA and BPOA on climatically important behaviour related to their potential to impact on direct and indirect radiative forcing.\n\n\n\nThe three objectives above will be fulfilled by the field deployment to be carried out over the coming few months. Plans were drawn up, arrangements made and instruments have been shipped to Brazil for deployment at the TT34 measurement station north of Manaus in June 2013, pending customs clearance. Non-refractory particle chemical composition will be measured using the High Resolution Aerodyne Time of Flight Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (HRToF- AMS) for direct comparison with that measured by the long-term ACSM. A Hygroscopicity Tandem Differential Mobility Analyser (HTDMA) will measure particle growth factors (&lt; 10% to 90% RH) and assess the mixing states of the aerosol. Cloud droplet activation potential of size resolved particles will be derived from a CCN counter sampling monodisperse aerosol from a Differential Mobility Particle Sizer (DMPS), from which the dry aerosol size distribution will also be recorded. A Multi Angle Absorption Spectrometer (MAAP) will quantify the contribution of black carbon (BC). A WIBS-3 dual channel UV fluorescence instrument will be used to detect bioaerosols, primary biogenic particles which may significantly contribute to organic aerosol mass and coarse mode and IN number. The instrument will provide rapid realtime measurement of the number size distributions of total and biologically-derived particles. All instruments are en route. \n\n\n\nThere were a further two strategic planning and infrastructure development objectivess that the BUNIAACIC programme will address, as follows:\n\n\n\nvi) construction of a White Paper outlining the recommended strategic methodology for UK participation in Amazonian atmospheric research;\n\n\n\nTwo large meetings were carried out between UK and Brazilian personnel to investigate activities of mutual interest that could be envisaged within existing and forthcoming funding frameworks. \n\nFrom 15th - 17th February 2012, we held our kickoff meeting at the LBA offices at INPA in Manaus, Brazil. UK scientists from the Universities of Manchester, Lancaster, York, Leeds and Leicester, the Met Office and the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology met like-minded scientists from across Brazil for three days of discussion and exchange of ideas. A number of the participants gave presentations describing their interests in the collaboration. One day was spent visiting the lidar site at Embrapa and the measurement towers at ZF2, north of Manaus. This provided an opportunity to scope out potential locations for the pump-priming deployment and other activities. A follow up meeting in the UK was loosely scheduled for the beginning of July 2012.\n\nFrom 2nd - 3rd July 2012, the follow-up meeting was held at the University of Manchester, UK, involving both UK and Brazilian stakeholders. The first day was largely occupied by progress updates on existing projects. Discussions then moved on to opportunities to engage with NERC's Human-modified Tropical Forests program, with input from experts in the field of biodiversity. Material and notes from both meetings can be accessed through the project webpages (some restricted to meeting participants). \n\n\n\nOutcomes from the discussions have been the subject of follow-up communication and consolidation into a webform for stakeholder consultation prior to construction of a White Paper draft for wider circulation.\n\n\n\nvii) appropriate planning for follow-up activities to address the research strategy on appropriate timescales, likely to include preparation of a consortium proposal.\n\n \n\nThe intensive deployment is intended to act as a pump-priming activity for the development of further larger-scale collaborations, most likely through a consortium proposal. Discussions to this end with our project partners and UK stakeholders are ongoing. Objective vi) of BUNIAACIC is the construction of a White Paper outlining the recommended strategic methodology for UK participation in Amazonian atmospheric research;\n\n\n\nThis has been discussed obliquely and directly at both of the major project meetings both i) in the context of piecemeal collaboration through e.g. opportunities to engage with NERC's Human-modified Tropical Forests program, with input from experts in the field of biodiversity and ii) specifically in the context of a broader collaborative atmospheric research agenda.\n\nOutcomes from the discussions have been the subject of follow-up communication and consolidation into a webform for stakeholder consultation prior to construction of a White Paper draft for wider circulation.\n\n\n\nThe intensive deployment is intended to act as a pump-priming activity for the development of further larger-scale collaborations, most likely through a consortium proposal, in fulfillment of objective vii) ","dataset":"gtr"}
