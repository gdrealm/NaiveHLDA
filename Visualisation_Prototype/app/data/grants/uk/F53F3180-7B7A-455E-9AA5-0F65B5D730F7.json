From Digital Record to Population Observatory","abstractText":"DReSS II is a three-year continuation of the ESRC National Centre for e-Social Science Research Node 'Understanding New Forms of Digital Record for e-Social Science'. DReSS II focuses on the continued development of a software package called the Digital Replay System (DRS) that supports qualitative research in the digital age. DRS enables researchers to combine heterogeneous data including audio, video, photographs, fieldnotes and interviews with data recorded within digital environments â€“ ie 'system logs' which capture screen recordings, SMS messages, GPS, sensor data, indeed any data generated within a computational environment. DRS provides a suite of tools that enables system logs to be 1) visualized, 2) synchronized with other data, 3) replayed alongside other data much as video may be replayed, and 4) represented and re-represented to support different kinds of analysis. Representational tools support naturalistic and structured forms of analysis through the provision of sophisticated coding mechanisms and the transformation of coded results into quantitative representations. DRS is the ongoing product of co-design between social scientists and computer scientists. It supports established research practices and combines them with the development of new methods to enable qualitative researchers to understand and unpack interaction in the emerging digital society.\n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-149-25-1067","grantId":"RES-149-25-1067","fundValue":"718364","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  One example of e-Science Programme impact has been the investments in the social sciences that have been important in two areas: geographic and spatial sciences (GENeSIS) and qualitative analysis (DRESS) ... Probably the most important impact is the way in which the e-Science investments have situated social scientists to respond to the ESRC grand challenges. Indeed, two of the e-Social Science nodes were the recipients of major ESRC Digital Economy investments, namely in Aberdeen (Policy Grid/Rural Communities) and Nottingham (DRESS/Creative Industries). \n\nRCUK Review of e-Science 2009 Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software) Societal","person":"Andrew  Crabtree","coPersons":["Chris  Greenhalgh","Svenja  Adolphs","Ronald  Carter","Steve  Benford","Thomas  Rodden"],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":" DReSS II resulted in the development of an Open Source software package (DRS) that has attracted broad interest from diverse research communities including, corpus linguistics, Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), learning science, informatics, science and technology studies, performing arts studies, and qualitative research. The software has been used to conduct a range of substantive studies including studies of end-user programming, the social use of spectator interfaces and multi-user touch surfaces, novel amusement park rides, uses of domestic broadband and home networks, crisis management, video conferencing, new media performances, pervasive games, healthcare training, educational uses of virtual environments, and multi-modal communication, and it has been drawn upon by social scientists to shape methodological debates around computing and visual methods. DRS demonstrates the possibilities for social research of digital records. In this respect, DRS has also inspired the development of new tools to support performance studies and information visualisation and driven burgeoning interest in the analytic purchase of new forms of data capture and use in the Computer Aided Qualitative AnalysiS (CAQDAS) community.
