During the course of this project, the investigator was invited to give talks at the Home Office, Number 10 Downing Street, the Department for International Development, and the Ministry of Defence. Presentations were also made at fringe events in the European Parliament.\nSpecific questions concerning UK public opinion on the use of drone warfare, the utility and desirability of DFID's aid effort to Syria, and the public's attitudes towards NATO (in advance of the summit that took place in September 2014), were specifically placed on surveys at the behest of public sector officials. The investigator foresaw the threat posed by UK nationals who went over to Syria to fight in the civil war, either for or against ISIS. Survey results measuring the actions the public thought the Government should take made it to the highest levels of Government and were part of a short policy paper the investigator wrote for the think tank, The Foreign Policy Centre. \nFindings from the project received extensive media coverage and the applicant made regular appearances on LBC and BBC radio to discuss results, particularly as salient foreign policy matters arose. Findings were covered in the Financial Times and by international outlets in countries such as Canada and Slovakia.\nIn recognition of the relevant work the investigator had undertaken, he was invited onto the Global Uncertainties group and was placed on the enhanced impact scheme of RCUK's Partnership for Conflict, Crime &amp; Security Research (PaCCS). Outreach continues and is ongoing.

The investigator designed and fielded five wave panel surveys of representative samples of US and UK citizens and single cross-sectional surveys of Canadians, French, and German respondents. Additional funding from non-ESRC sources allowed for additional waves of data from respondents in France and Germany. \nKey findings to emerge from the project include:\n1) Foreign policy attitudes for citizens are not uni-dimensional, but are coherent. For example, in the United States, citizens have well-formed opinions concerning the utility of using military force unilaterally to solve world problems and these attitudes are distinct from how feelings about foreign aid and humanitarian efforts. In the other nations (UK, Germany, France, and Canada), the structure of attitudes differs slightly, but the general multi-dimensional pattern holds.\n2) Foreign policy attitudes do not appear out of nowhere. Anchoring foreign and domestic policy attitudes are an individual's core values (measured by the cross-nationally valid Schwartz battery that appears on the surveys) and/or personality traits (measured by the common &quot;Big 5&quot; item questionnaire)\n3) The public is prudent in shifting their attitudes in response to changing events, and a willingness to see their nation get involved either for military or humanitarian purposes is a function of whether they perceive the action will be successful. A key determinant of whether or not the public will support a foreign policy decision is whether the parameters for success are well defined. \n4) Although values and personality anchor foreign policy attitudes, framing of events does matter. Asking citizens if they agree or disagree with &quot;torture&quot; as opposed to &quot;enhanced interrogation&quot; to get information from suspected terrorists will elicit slightly different response patterns. Respondents can take cues from the positions taken by their favored party or leader but no amount of grandstanding by elites will get the public behind an ill-conceived mission (see paper on British attitudes towards involvement in Afghanistan and Libya). \n5) Foreign policy attitudes can be relevant in electoral politics. One paper published as a result of this research programme demonstrates that people identifying with the Conservative Party in Canada will take significantly different positions on the coherent foreign policy attitude dimensions for militarism and internationalism and those positions on these dimensions drive support for Prime Minister Harper and his party. Similar results obtain in other nations studied in this project. \nThese are some of the main highlights of findings from the data. Secondary analysis has begun by researchers interested in questions that differ from those of the investigator--for example one academic user has examined how religious participation affects individual level foreign policy attitudes using the first three waves of the UK panel from this study. The investigator has run specific analyses for end users in the public sector, and this activity is highlighted in the narrative impact section. The investigator developed the longest running panel study of citizen attitudes towards foreign policy matters in the US and UK. The instruments measure public opinion in response to changing events and emerging crises. Government officials can utilize this examine to show how, for example, individual attitudes towards the utility of invading Iraq and judgments of the success of these operations change over time. Data can also shed light on how these publics reacted to one off crises such as unrest in Mali and events that began during the course of the study--on the latter point, the investigator provided some of the earliest polling on British attitudes towards intervention in Syria and data reflect the public's hesitancy which culminated in a Parliamentary vote against involvement at the end of summer 2013. The data can be further analysed to understand better the motivations behind this reaction and why the public is now more open to responding to the threat posed by the Islamic State.\n\nIf further funding is obtained, the German and French mini panels can be extended. The investigator is working with colleagues in the UK, Germany, and Japan to apply for an ORA grant to conduct additional surveys.
