{"id":"1044EDF2-3F73-4C6C-A6A1-C0A1DCC5D3A4","title":"Statistical Methods for Pharamacogenetics","abstractText":"Pharmacogenetics is the use of genetic information to improve the prescribing of drugs, either through rapid prediction of the correct dose for a patient according to his/her genetic type, or by avoiding the prescription of drugs to those with unsuitable genetic types. Until recently pharmacogenetics was focussed on a small number of genes known to be involved in drug transport or action, but increasingly genetic data from the whole genome is taken into account. Although so-called personalised medicine has been talked about for many years now, the achievements to date in this area remain limited to a few diseases and drugs. One bottleneck in the process is efficient statistical analysis of datasets that are often relatively small, but complex in terms of both the outcome measures made on patients and the diversity of patients and their treatments. The goal of this proposal is to develop and make available better statistical methods that can help make pharmacogenetics more productive.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0901388","grantId":"G0901388","fundValue":"542591","fundStart":"2010-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"David J Balding","coPersons":["Michael Roy Johnson","Nicholas William Wood"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
