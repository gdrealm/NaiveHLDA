This has been achieved by nanosecond laser processing of metal surfaces to produce a micro-structured surface that suppresses secondary electron emission. Electron cloud mitigation (minimisation) techniques will be of general use in space &amp;amp; aerospace applications, plus in general vacuum electronic development.
