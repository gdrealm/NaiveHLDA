Due to the islands' unique location between warm-maritime and cold-polar climates, the size of sub-Antarctic ice-cap advances provide a potentially valuable means of calibrating the sensitivity of ice-sheet models, ensuring the climate parameters used to force them are realistic and the outputs 'good' for the future. Variations in the scale and timing of glacial events can also provide critical information on the mechanisms and phasing of climate changes between regions and hemispheres. The same data constrain the whereabouts and persistence of glacial refugia, and inform biologists on the geological conditions governing the evolution and diversity of life in the Southern Ocean. \n To improve ice-sheet models, explain patterns of climate change, and interpret the biodiversity of the world's oceans, information on sub-Antarctica's glacial past is required. However, fundamental questions relating to the age, magnitude, and number of past glaciations remain unanswered. For the largest sub-Antarctic island, South Georgia, at least one major glacial advance is already known from ice-carved troughs and sediment ridges (moraines) found on the sea-floor of the shallow shelf surrounding the island today. Yet its age is unknown. As in other parts of Antarctica, the most recent episode of glaciation - The Last Glacial Maximum - is likely to have left behind the best record of ice-cap advance and melting. However, even here, there is no consensus, with two conflicting hypotheses prevailing: one suggesting a limited ice extent, restricted to the near-shore fjords; the other proposing that the ice cap was extensive, reaching the outer parts of the shelf around most of the island. Answers to which hypothesis is correct lie in the study of the submarine topography and sediments, which have yet to be investigated in any detail. \n This project proposes a pioneering study to examine the extent and timing of past glaciations on South Georgia, from a marine perspective, for the first time. I will provide a robust test of the hypotheses that, either: (i) the Last Glacial Maximum ice cap was of restricted extent and thus that one or more major ice cap glaciations that reached outer shelf limits pre-date the last glacial period; or that (ii) the Last Glacial Maximum ice cap was extensive, and a chronology of retreat is recorded in the shelf's landscape and sediments. \n Existing and newly-collected sonar bathymetry data will be utilised to map out the glacial features on the South Georgia shelf in unprecedented detail. Six sediment cores, among the first recovered from the shelf, will be analysed and dated. The project will target moraines marking the limits of former ice-caps, from the shelf edge to the coastal fjords. I will determine the age of the most extensive glaciation, and the age of intermediate retreat or terminal limits. Physical analyses of sediments will reconstruct environmental conditions during and since the Last Glacial Maximum, to the present day, and perhaps through older cold or warm periods. Resolving the number and extent of former shelf glaciations preserved in sub-Antarctic records will be a major outcome of the project, as will vital new information on the behaviour and reach of the Last Glacial ice cap. \n New records will be set in the context of Earth's climate and evolutionary histories, and form the first marine palaeo-constraints on sub-Antarctic glaciation, benefiting modellers, climate scientists and biologists. The project will also provide baseline geological data for use by habitat mapping projects and fisheries. This research will shed new light on Southern Ocean ice and climate history, and set a new agenda for future study of past glacial change in the near-polar regions.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/K000527/2","grantId":"NE/K000527/2","fundValue":"42972","fundStart":"2013-08-01","fundEnd":"2014-11-30","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  - Academic: New findings have been incorporated into the RAISED consortium; a community reconstruction of the extent and timing of the last glacial maximum and deglaciation of Antarctica. \n- Academic/Industry: Glacial geological results are being utilised by marine biologists studying the biodiversity of sea-floor habitats around South Georgia.

Sampling of some of the moraine features that comprise this submarine landscape has been successful, and we are currently in the process of constraining ages for the sediments which will tie the record of ice cap fluctuations to a known chronology. This work should provide insights into the scale of Pleistocene glaciations in the sub-Antarctic, the forcing behind glacial advance and retreat in these understudied sub-polar regions, and will have wider implications for the evolution of benthic life at the sea-floor and the whereabouts of glacial refugia. We are engaged in discussion with benthic biologists at the University of Southampton and BAS regarding the link between glacial geology and evolution of shelf fauna. Future publication of integrated geophysical and geological data is anticipated in journals of international standing.\n- We have published a compilation of high-resolution multibeam bathymetry datasets from South Georgiaâ€™s fjords, from which we have made new observations of the fjord glacial geomorphology and proposed a chronological model for the formation of fjord moraines that can go on to be tested further. \n- We have published a review of sub-Antarctic glaciation in a leading Quaternary Science journal.\n- We have contributed towards a German-led study of methane venting from South Georgia fjord-bottom sediments, supported by NERC funding to PI Graham.\n- Project funding helped towards hosting a successful session on the glacial, climatic and geological evolution of South Georgia and the sub-Antarctic Southern Ocean at EGU 2014. PI Graham was lead convener. \n- New international research networks have been established with the Alfred-Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research (AWI), in Bremerhaven, and researchers working on methane seepage from the South Georgia sea-floor at the MARUM, University of Bremen. PI Graham has been involved with two collaborative ship-time proposals to the German DFG, to continue to investigate the history of ice cap glaciation in the sub-Antarctic using seismic profiling techniques to look at the geological evolution of the South Georgia block in more detail.\n- A new PhD studentship, starting in October 2014 at the University of Nottingham (PI Graham is co-supervisor, with Prof. Melanie Leng), will explore oceanographic changes around South Georgia through the Holocene using sediment cores collected as part of the project. \n- A MSc student, co-supervised by PI Graham, successfully defended his thesis at the University of Bremen. The thesis looked at Holocene climatic variability from core material and geophysical data obtained during this NERC project. - on completion of the project, data will be made publically-available in the South Georgia online GIS database, and will be of potential use to a variety of researchers from a range of disciplines\n- geological history will be provided to biologists who are assessing the marine biodiversity of the South Georgia shelf (collaboration ongoing)\n- we will open a dialogue with fisheries representatives at BAS who are keen to know how geology relates to fish stocks and abundance\n- variety of further academic proposals and collaborations resulting directly from the study (German and UK led).
