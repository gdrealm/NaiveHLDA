The programme aims to develop a stronger evidence base for crime reduction. It will enhance the UKâ€™s capacity to develop, disseminate and apply evidence-based approaches to crime reduction and make such evidence readily available to crime reduction practitioners. There will be an emphasis throughout on understanding not simply what works, but how it works.

Extracted what is known on the basis of these reviews in a format that is useable by practitioners. Completed 3 additional systematic review of what works. Developed a novel system of categorising the evidence to meet the needs of practitioners. Completed preparatory work on the baseline knowledge of police staff in preparation for the development of training programme. This is the first year of a major development programme. We will be in a better position to answer this question in 2015. Communities and Social Services/Policy,Security and Diplomacy","dataset":"gtr"}
