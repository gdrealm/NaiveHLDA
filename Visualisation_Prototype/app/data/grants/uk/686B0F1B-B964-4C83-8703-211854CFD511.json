Some MPs express worries that voters may be swayed in their choice by the photos.&nbsp;This concern is consistent with psychologists’ findings that we automatically make judgements about people’s characters based on the briefest inspection of facial appearance, and that these judgements influence behaviour towards them. This is especially true when, as with most constituency candidates, we know little else about the people. </p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<p>This research is designed to test whether, via such a psychological process, ballot-paper photographs would influence the outcomes of British elections.&nbsp;It is based on a series of web-based experimental elections. &nbsp;In each, an MP rated low on appearance (in a prior study) competes with one rated highly.&nbsp;Two campaign flyers are designed, reporting the candidate's party, policy stances, and biographical details. The two MPs’ photos are varied randomly across the two flyers. To the extent that parties perform better when represented by the ‘high-appearance’ candidate, that can only be due to the photos. So this simple experimental design allows us precisely to measure the impact of appearance, and thereby to inform the policy debate on ballot-paper photographs.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2255","grantId":"RES-000-22-2255","fundValue":"33809","fundStart":"2007-04-01","fundEnd":"2008-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Robert Alexander Johns","coPersons":["Mark Peter Shephard"],"organisation":"University of Strathclyde","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
