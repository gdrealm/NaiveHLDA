{"id":"2DA896E1-8D38-45D5-88FE-BCDC630F1D11","title":"An in vitro compartmentalisation screen for mammalian DNA demethylases","abstractText":"Our genome carries epigenetic information on top of the genetic one which is important for normal development and function of a healthy organism. Some epigenetic marks in DNA are based on addition of a small chemical group to the DNA. These marks occur in different organs and make them work properly. The marks however have to be removed again in germ cells, so that babies start their development with a clean slate . Also, these marks have to be reprogrammed when cells are taken from patients and transformed back into stem cells for treatment, which is a new and potentially revolutionary concept in regenerative medicine. This grant application proposes to identify factors with which epigenetic marks can be removed from DNA, which might conceivably lead to big improvements in stem cell generation from patients, and hence regenerative medicine.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0801727","grantId":"G0801727","fundValue":"365801","fundStart":"2009-01-01","fundEnd":"2011-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Wolf  Reik","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Babraham Institute","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
