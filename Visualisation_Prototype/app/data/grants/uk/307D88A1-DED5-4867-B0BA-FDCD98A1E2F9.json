{"id":"307D88A1-DED5-4867-B0BA-FDCD98A1E2F9","title":"CLOVER: Measuring Gravitational Waves from Inflation","abstractText":"The Cosmic Microeave Background (CMB)is a radiation emmitted in the early Universe. It tells us that the Universe has a begining in time. Measurement to date of the intensity of the CMB are consistent with the inflation theory of the origin of the Universe, however there is much still to learn. Structure-galaxies clusters and super-clusters of galaxies- that we see in the sky are generated by primordial quantum fluctuations of space time during an exponential expansion phase during the first fraction of a second of the existance of the Universe. These primordial quantum fluctuations are a source of a background of gravitational waves, which in turn generates a signature on the polarisation of the CMB, known as B-mode signature. To achieve this high sensitivity, new world-class technologies are being developed in the UK.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=PP/D00120X/1","grantId":"PP/D00120X/1","fundValue":"350352","fundStart":"2005-02-11","fundEnd":"2009-02-10","funder":"STFC","impactText":"  Development of receivers for measurement of the cosmic microwave background  ","person":"Ghassan  Yassin","coPersons":["Michael Edward Jones","Angela Clare Taylor"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
