These valuable goals will be achieved through a close partnership between the project's lead engineer and a surgeon, bringing together precise experimental methods, novel materials and design and clinical expertise. The outcomes of this exciting research will help scientists, engineers and clinicians in their research, and has significant potential to bring improvements to society and the economy.\n\n*Background:\nModern surgery increasingly uses minimally-invasive surgical (MIS) techniques (or 'keyhole surgery'). In MIS the surgeon operates on tissues using a camera and long instruments inserted into the body though small access 'ports'. The advantages of MIS are substantial including faster recovery and lower complications for the patient. However, the long instruments make it difficult for the surgeon to 'feel' the tissues inside the body. This is a particular problem with surgical graspers, plier-like instruments used in place of the surgeon's hand to hold and move tissues. Appropriate use of the graspers is crucial, but difficult, for the surgeon to achieve; grasping or pulling too hard causes tissue damage with potentially fatal consequences for the patient, but grasping too lightly risks the tissue slipping - complicating and lengthening the operation.\nThe applicants lead the Surgical Technologies research group and have a strong background in using engineering techniques to measure and understand the behaviour of surgical instruments and their interaction with tissues. They have supervised research to develop grasper systems with can record and control the gripping forces they apply to tissues. The group also has expertise in developing novel bio-adhesive materials that use microscopic patterns to grip tissue while avoiding damage.\n\n*Research Plan:\nThere is a clear need for better surgical grasping instruments and a definite opportunity to use engineering methods to improve the situation. \nThe aim is to optimise the surgical grasper's performance so that they grip securely while minimising/eliminating damage to the patients' tissues. This comes in two parts; 1) an experimental study to increase our understanding of grasper performance 2) integrating our bio-adhesive materials in a grasper to improve grip at lower grasping forces.\nExperimental Study: Through our previous work we will develop a system to reproduce surgical grasping in the lab using samples of model tissue. This will be used to investigate grasper performance in an experimental study, providing detailed data on how the system responds as both grasp and pulling forces are varied. This information will be linked with clinical measures of tissue damage (showing how tissue cells are effected) to determine which grasping conditions which are unsafe for use.\nOptimised Grasper: Using knowledge from the study, an improved grasper system will be developed by selecting an appropriate bio-adhesive material that can be integrated onto the grasper's jaws. This will use our expertise in the area to provide a grasper that offers enhanced grip at lower grasping forces to prevent tissue damage.\n\n*Outcomes:\nThis research offers to provide exciting advances in healthcare through the application of engineering science to a surgical application. The outcomes from the research will have benefits locally (developing the research and group led by the early-career applicants) and nationally (in science, engineering and clinical research). They will inform surgical training and are highly valuable to the medical device industry. To ensure these benefits reach their broad audience the work will be 1) published in multidisciplinary journals 2) discussed at academic and industry conferences/seminars 3) prepared for future commercialisation using expert resources at the host university.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/L022273/1","grantId":"EP/L022273/1","fundValue":"99320","fundStart":"2014-09-30","fundEnd":"2016-03-29","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter Robert Culmer","coPersons":["Gregory William Taylor"],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
