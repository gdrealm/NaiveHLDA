If growth conditions become unfavourable only some cells in a bacterial population choose to differentiate into specialized cells. The advantage is that it leaves other cells capable of inducing other survival strategies, and this could be favourable in case the environmental conditions change again. The fact that some cells choose to differentiate whereas other cells do not, whereas they are all genetically the same and live in the same environment, can be achieved by a so called 'bistable' genetic switch. Central to this switch is a positive feedback loop. Activation of this loop requires that the concentration of the activator reaches a certain threshold level in the cell. In bistable switches it is assumed that the concentration of the activator varies between cells and relies on the stochastic fluctuations (noise) in basal mRNA synthesis. In some cells the concentration of activator reaches the threshold level and in such cells the auto-stimulatory feedback loop is switched on. Thus, noise in basic cellular processes is an essential factor in bistable gene regulation. However, which of the cellular processes contribute most to this noise is debatable. The prevailing view is that differences in transcriptional activities provide the main source of noise in bacteria. However, in this proposal I put forward other basic cellular processes, including growth rate, cellular localization of proteases and DNA replication as possible major factors in the activation of bistable gene regulation. A popular model system to study bistable gene expression is the development of genetic competence in the bacterium Bacillus subtilis. This cellular state enables the bacterium to take up and incorporate extracellular DNA with the potency to gain useful genetic material. At the centre of the competence signal transduction cascade lays the auto-stimulatory activation of the competence transcription factor ComK. This positive feedback loop is responsible for the bistable nature of competence development, and this feedback loop will be used to investigate what the main sources of noise are that determine the outcome of this bistable switch. It is now apparent that bistable differentiation processes are ubiquitous and are also part of essential differentiation pathways in higher eukaryotes. In addition, pathogenic microorganisms use bistable regulation to evade antibiotic treatment. Moreover, the seemingly unpredictable behaviour of individual cells in bacterial populations poses difficulties in the biotech and food industry, as well. Because of the wide spread implications it is essential to gain more knowledge on the basic cellular processes that govern the outcome of bistable switches.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I004238/1","grantId":"BB/I004238/1","fundValue":"345426","fundStart":"2011-04-04","fundEnd":"2014-04-03","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Leendert  Hamoen","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
