But how effective is the model when applied in the UK context? This study provides an in-depth description and analysis of the workings and dynamics of the SFNEO, its adaptation to local environments, stakeholders and institutions, and the quality of its interventions. It aims to assess how successful the SFNEO is in its first three years of operation, and its potential for transferability elsewhere, alongwith potential problems and pitfalls. The SFNEO is under development, and its research and evalaution advisory committee (see list of research collaborators) has been instrumental in defining the aims and objectives of the study. A large number of organizations are collaborating in the establishment of the SFNEO and they and their counterparts elsewhere in the UK will be the beneficiaries of the research. Other regions are waiting eagerly to see whether and if so how the SFNEO performs, and the dissemination of the results of this study through the network of the other eight regional tobacco control co-ordinators in England is built into the proposal. A project steering group will oversee the progress and development of the research. This will comprise a balance of members from the SFNEO s research and evaluation advisory and management steering groups, including lay members. Tobacco use remains the single most important preventable cause of illness and death in the UK today and of the English regions, the North East bears the greatest burden. Understanding how effective an intervention the SFNEO represents, and its potential transferability to other regions, could have a major impact on health and healthcare in the UK.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0501277","grantId":"G0501277","fundValue":"148520","fundStart":"2006-04-01","fundEnd":"2009-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Andrew  Russell","coPersons":["James  Mason","David James Hunter","Martin  White","Rachel Elizabeth Casiday","David  Chappel"],"organisation":"Durham University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
