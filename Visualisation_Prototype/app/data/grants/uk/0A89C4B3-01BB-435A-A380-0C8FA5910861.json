Microfibril dysfunction in ageing and disease causes loss of tissue elasticity in tissues such as the vasculature, lungs, skin and eyes, with potential life-threatening consequences. This study of the assembly and function of microfibrils will provide critical new insights into how they underpin tissue elasticity and integrity, and how microfibril dysfunction due to fibrillin mutations (in severe heritable diseases such as Marfan syndrome and other ‘fibrillinopathies’) or to degradation affects their biological function. This information has far-reaching implications for human health. It will lead to improved diagnoses for the fibrillinopathies, identify new therapeutic targets and strategies for recapitulating elastic properties in wound repair and ageing tissues, and contribute to tissue engineering approaches such as vascular graft design. There may also be commercial applications for elastic biopolymers based on the molecular principles of microfibrils.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0200246","grantId":"G0200246","fundValue":"793295","fundStart":"2004-01-01","fundEnd":"2008-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Cay  Kielty","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
