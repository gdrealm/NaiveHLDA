In the long-term we might not be able to treat infectious diseases due to the lack of effective therapeutic agents. Therefore there is a need to develop effective therapeutics based on new targets and approaches. One of the most promising approaches is to develop innovative therapies based on the modulation of the host-microorganism interface, specifically to target the strategies employed by the microorganisms to manipulate for their own benefit host defense responses. \n\nKlebsiella pneumoniae is a microorganism causing a wide range of infections, from urinary tract infections to pneumonia. The latter is particularly devastating among immunocompromised patients. K. pneumoniae is a member of the so-called ESKAPE group of microorganisms to emphasize that they effectively &quot;escape&quot; the effects of antibacterial drugs. Therefore it is both urgent and necessary to better understand Klebsiella infection biology to be able to design new strategies to treat K. pneumoniae infections.\n\nPrevious studies from the laboratory support the notion that Klebsiella targets key cellular pathways to prevent the activation of host defense responses. Analysis of pathways targeted by Klebsiella should reveal the strategies used to subvert immune responses and lead to the identification of the various Achilles heels of host defence. By applying a multidisciplinary approach, the overall purpose of this proposal is to expand our current understanding of the strategies used by Klebsiella to survive in the lung. We will dissect how Klebsiella antagonizes the activation of the main pathways controlling the majority of host defense responses upon infection. We will study at the molecular level how Klebsiella perturbs the activation of the receptors that the host employs to sense the presence of an infection. And, finally, we will decipher how Klebsiella manipulates the modifications that the cells used to rapidly, locally and specifically modify activity or interactions of key proteins implicated in sensing/responding infections. \n\nThe anticipated results of this proposal should initiate the process of the development of drugs which can serve as therapeutic agent to treat Klesiella infections effectively and perhaps other infections as well. It might be possible that there are drugs already approved for use in humans but used for purposes unrelated to antimicrobial activity, that modulate the target identified in the context of host-Klebsiella interactions. This will significantly short cut or even bypass the drug-development process. It is therefore believed that such targets - if found and validated during the research - will meet big interest at pharmaceutical companies, involved in the development of anti-infective agents.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/L007223/1","grantId":"BB/L007223/1","fundValue":"573163","fundStart":"2014-03-01","fundEnd":"2017-02-28","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  After nine months from starting the project, there is nothing to be reported.

The follow up of the anticipated results of this proposal should initiate the process of the development of therapeutics aimjing to prevent this Klebsiella strategy. Interestingly, there are drugs already approved for use in humans but used for purposes unrelated to antimicrobial activity, that modulate the target identified in the context of host-Klebsiella interactions. Academics: Our exciting results highlight that Klebsiella employs a hithertho unknown strategy to block the activation of host defence responses will be of interest for those researchers working in the &quot;microbial anti-immunology&quot; field.\nNon-academics: It is believed that industry (bio tech and big pharma) will be interested to know the new targets found and validated during the research. The targets will be patented and subsequently industrial partners for the joint development of therapies will be sought. Typically, such a licensing or co-development contract involves up-front payments, mile stone payments, and royalty payments for the patent holder(s). Such payments, depending on the economic potential of the drug, can reach significant numbers in the magnitude of several millions or tens of millions (in case of drugs with blockbuster potential).
