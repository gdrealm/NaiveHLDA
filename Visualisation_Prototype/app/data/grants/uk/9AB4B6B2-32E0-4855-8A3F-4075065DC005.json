As a result, coaches operate within a framework of regulations and guidelines which creates extreme anxiety. For many coaches, a context has been created which has led them to question the risks and benefits of their continuing involvement. </p>\n\n<p>In the run-up to the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games, these developments have the potential to put at risk the achievement of key aspects of the intended Games legacy - widened participation and sport for all. </p>\n\n<p>This project aims to broaden the impact of previous work by applying its qualitative methods in a new area so as to provide comparative data. Through interview and observation the project will facilitate and support practitioner debate and intervention. The researchers will ensure that the research and its implications receive widespread publicity and discussion in circles where the power to make a difference resides.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-4156","grantId":"RES-000-22-4156","fundValue":"79280","fundStart":"2010-10-04","fundEnd":"2011-10-17","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  The findings of this research and a previous related piece of research have been used by many.

Having discovered that sports coaches and PE teachers are as concerned about touching (and other personal acts) children and young people as teachers and carers - impact activity has focussed on the unhelpfulness of the current approach. Others could usefully question what they and others do but in a different way to the current default questioning. They should consider what is best for children and young people, not what is likely to be seen as 'good' practice, by those who promote defensive risk-free practices.
