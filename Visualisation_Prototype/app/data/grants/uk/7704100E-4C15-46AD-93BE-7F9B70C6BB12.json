{"id":"7704100E-4C15-46AD-93BE-7F9B70C6BB12","title":"A Profiler for Crime, Criminal Justice and Social Harm","abstractText":"While government has been the custodian of statistical information about society, particularly about crime, criminal justice and social harm, an open society depends upon the wider accessibility of data to support its deliberations. Since the public at large cannot be expected to collate and analyse such data by themselves, those acting on its behalf have an important role to play in contributing to informed public understanding and debate. Nevertheless, although the 'data explosion' is generating large amounts of relevant information about social conditions, it is becoming increasingly difficult for the charitable or 'third sector' of civil society to grasp and make use of this to help society as a whole come to the best decisions about what to do about troubling social issues such as crime and justice. \n\nThe objective of this project is to prototype the development of a 'Profiler' that can enable civil society opinion formers to better understand factors affecting crime, criminal justice and social harm. In so doing, it will provide civil society representatives with valuable insights into how social, economic and demographic factors shape the distribution of social harm in society. It will seek to improve overall strategic policy-making in crime and criminal justice by helping the charitable sector to debate with government, and to inform parliamentarians, the media, the voluntary sector, faith communities, minority groups, and the general public itself, thereby expanding the evidence base available for responsible and representative policy-making for society as a whole. \n\nThe project aims to develop a 'Profiler' that harnesses the tools of the information-based 'Big Data' revolution that is sweeping through the commercial and media world. The purpose of the Profiler is to enable its users to assemble and collate data on social and economic conditions and relate them to statistics on crime and criminal justice. The term Big Data encapsulates both the large-scale, complex and fast-moving nature of information in contemporary society and the new and powerful computational tools that are being developed to analyse it. Delivering on the promise of Big Data means that the Profiler must communicate information that is understandable, timely, and meets users' needs and requirements, enabling both producers and consumers of information to reach outcomes together, thereby creating new and useful insights that would not have been apparent due to the scale and complexity of the information. \n\nHitherto, this complex research work has had to be carried out by academic researchers. Although findings, alongside government statistics, are stored by the UK Data Service, they have not been easily useable by charities and voluntary organisations or accessible to the general public. This project is a unique partnership between criminologists, data scientists, and the foremost educational charity in the criminal justice field to overcome these obstacles. By bringing advanced analytical tools and expert criminological knowledge together in a powerful, user-friendly computer system, it is hoped to make this specialist knowledge more widely accessible and thereby to improve the quality of decision-making in criminal justice policy and practice for the benefit of society as a whole.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/M010295/1","grantId":"ES/M010295/1","fundValue":"150136","fundStart":"2015-07-27","fundEnd":"2016-07-26","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Timothy John Hope","coPersons":["Farid  Meziane","Roger Henry Grimshaw","Mohamad  Saraee","Robert Andrew Aspin"],"organisation":"University of Salford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
