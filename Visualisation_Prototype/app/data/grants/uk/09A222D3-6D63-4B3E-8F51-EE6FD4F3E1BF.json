{"id":"09A222D3-6D63-4B3E-8F51-EE6FD4F3E1BF","title":"Further development of an African swine fever virus live attenuated vaccine","abstractText":"African swine fever virus (ASFV) causes a severe disease of domestic pigs that can result in up to 100% mortality and has severe socio-economic impacts. ASFV is endemic in most sub-Saharan African countries and Sardinia. Since introduction of ASF in 2007 to Georgia, the disease has rapidly spread through the Russian Federation and the risk of further spread has increased. The lack of a vaccine limits options for disease control. Attenuated ASFV strain OURT88/3 induces good levels of protection in pigs against lethal challenge with virulent virus. Commercial development of this strain as a vaccine has been hampered by the lack of a suitable cell line to propagate the virus. We have now identified a pig macrophage cell line can be infected by OURT88/3 strain and the virus grown in these cells can still induce protection in pigs. We will investigate the use of this cell line for ASFV vaccine strain production and diagnosis. We will also identify partners for commercial development","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/L004267/1","grantId":"BB/L004267/1","fundValue":"550630","fundStart":"2014-02-17","fundEnd":"2017-08-16","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Linda Kathleen Dixon","coPersons":["Geraldine  Taylor","Christopher Lewis Netherton"],"organisation":"The Pirbright Institute","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
