The project showcases how scientists from seemingly unrelated backgrounds in tissue engineering and optical physics are collaborating to develop new healthcare technologies. The driver for the project is the increasing need to produce living human tissues, in the culture dish, with structures and functions that are as close as possible to those in the body and to use these in vitro tissues to more effectively test, develop and improve new and existing medicines and therapies. This approach can minimize use of animals in research and also reduce potentially costly, both health and economic, failures with new medicines.\n\nOur ability to achieve this ambitious goal of manufacturing living micro-tissues with lasers is underpinned by an instrument called an optical tweezers. Optical tweezers, invented in the 1980s exploit a phenomenon, whereby a tightly focused beam of laser light creates a localized force at its point of focus and has the effect of attracting small particles towards it - a so called optical trap or optical trapping. Suspending the particles within fluid gives a damping force producing a single (laser) beam optical trap that is stable in three dimensions (3D) - by moving the beam of laser light, the trapped particle can be also moved and controlled in multiple directions and subsequently positioned at defined points/locations with 'laser precision'. A range of different types and sizes of particles can be trapped and moved including, 2 micron (one 500th of a millimetre) glass beads to live human cells, which are typically 10 microns (one 100th of a millimetre) in size. Importantly, the properties of the laser, in terms of its power and wavelength are such that it causes little or no damage to cells and certainly in the time taken (seconds/minutes) to trap and move them.\n\nAn evolution of this instrument is the holographic optical tweezers, where the single laser beam is split to create multiple traps, each capable of holding and moving particles. This is done using a spatial light modulator (SLM), a component typically found in an overhead and/or data projector. The SLM acts as a diffractive optical element, or hologram, and can be continuously updated via a computer program. Thus, multiple traps can be created in 3D and each trap independently controlled and positioned to create predetermined configurations and patterns. Using conventional microscope optics and a joy stick or iPad touch screen, the traps can be visualized in real time and controlled with the dexterity of a 'virtual hand'. \n\nHere, we will use this technology to exert hitherto unattainable levels of control over the movements and positioning of live cells, with the predefined precision akin to natural processes of tissue development and formation. With dynamic, precision control at the scale of the individual cell, we will show how holographic optical tweezers can be used to manufacture definable and tuneable, 3D micro-tissues; micro-tissue components, such as cells or small (~5 micron) polymer particles containing drugs, can be assembled together within minutes in a manner similar to building with 'cell LEGO'. With inherent control over manufacturing complexity we can deliver 'simple' 3D cell aggregates with applications in drug discovery and pharmaceutical testing, each aggregate consistent with the next, assembled with an exact number of cells and drug-loaded microparticles. This will be the focus of this phase of the project. \n\nDeveloping the project further we will also seek to push the boundaries for manufacture of more complex, bespoke structures that mimic specific tissues like liver, skin, heart etc and can be used to better understand disease processes and develop new therapies.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/L022095/1","grantId":"EP/L022095/1","fundValue":"203566","fundStart":"2014-02-01","fundEnd":"2015-07-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  This project is ongoing, but we have been developing the technology over several years, allied to other projects and 'in-house' small value (?5-10K) research awards. High profile outputs included the Royal Society Summer Exhibition 2013, where we had an exhibit 'The Biology Builders' showcasing our approaches towards developing the field of tissue engineering /regenerative medicine. The holographic optical tweezers were a key part of the exhibit and had a live interface between the exhibition and our instrument in Nottingham and allowed visitors to move live cells and build small structures, remotely and in real time. This made a big impact!\n\nThe approach of cell-scale engineering with optical tweezers is also being disseminated to the next generation of scientists in the field via our CDT in Regenerative Medicine. As part of the CDT Capital Equipment Award we are also in the process of establishing another holographic optical tweezers to broaden engagement and teaching.

We are using an instrument called Holographic Optical Tweezers, which uses low energy laser light to move small objects, including living cells. We are using this approach to move stem cells and with the precision of a laser, position live cells into definable configurations and build small (micro) scale cellular structures that mimic arrangements of cells in the body. \n\nThe major goal of the project is to develop this technology to manufacture micro-tissues for delivery of regenerative medicine therapies and in the discovery and testing of new drugs.\n\nWork so far has demonstrated our ability to manufacture cell-scale products and work is in progress to increase production from one or two 'products' to hundreds. With precision manufacture of cell-scale/micro-tissue products this can be readily taken up by the pharmaceutical industry in developing new drugs and can also impact on the reduction, replacement and refinement of animals in medical research.\n\nFor the stem cell and regenerative medicine industries it provides tuneable cell models for modelling diseases and developing therapies.
