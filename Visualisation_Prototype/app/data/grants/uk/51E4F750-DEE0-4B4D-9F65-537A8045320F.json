{"id":"51E4F750-DEE0-4B4D-9F65-537A8045320F","title":"Case Study: Cultural Value of Accessible Theatre","abstractText":"Many people in society cannot benefit from the full value of cultural events if those events are not made available for them to access. \n\nWhile we tend to think of barriers to access as being geographical (the production I wish to see isn't touring to my part of the country) or financial (I'd love to see that production if I could afford the ticket price), people who have sensory impairments - either because of disability or aging - may additionally experience barriers based on lack of support for their access needs. People who have difficulty hearing a theatre production may need captions. People who are Deaf may need sign interpretation. People who have vision impairments may need audio description.\n\nJust as people in rural communities can feel excluded from culture as 'it all happens in London, never here', people with access needs may feel that those who create culture do not care whether or not they are excluded from being able to participate in that culture. \n\nResponding to this need, and prompted by legislation such as the Equality Act 2010, many cultural institutions have shown interest in making their cultural events accessible to the widest possible audience by making them inclusive. \n\nThe two organisations at the forefront of providing captioning and audio description services to theatres and live events in the UK are StageText (http://www.stagetext.org) and VocalEyes (http://www.vocaleyes.co.uk).\n\nWhile these organisations collect anecdotal evidence and survey evidence from people who attend their captioned and audio-described events, to date there has never been a rigorous and comprehensive assessment of the cultural value that making theatre accessible to their audiences generates.\n\nLondon Metropolitan University have partnered with StageText and VocalEyes to propose a research study that will seek to answer the following question - What is the cultural value of accessible theatre from the perspective of its two main stakeholder groups:\n- to the theatres (and businesses around them) that choose to provide captioned or audio-described performances, either to develop new audiences, or to bring former audiences back into the theatre; and\n- the audiences that those performances are aimed at (both those that choose to attend, and those who do not)\n\nWe envisage this research providing rigorous evidence for the value of accessible theatrical performance, and of inclusive cultural activity, for a range of stakeholders; supporting the on-going work of organisations like StageText and VocalEyes, and potentially contributing to increased opportunities for hearing and visually impaired people to engage in mainstream culture. It will further contribute to underpinning inclusive practice in the UK; supporting the nation's beacon status in this area. It will also aim to support and contribute to the on-going embedding of inclusion as cultural practice.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/L00562X/1","grantId":"AH/L00562X/1","fundValue":"38179","fundStart":"2013-07-18","fundEnd":"2013-12-17","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  Findings are being used by current providers of inclusive theatre services in their strategic thinking, partnership proposals and funding applications to government funding bodies like the Arts Council.

This doesn't negate the need to schedule accessible performances, due to the remaining legal and ethical business cases. However, the current fragility in the economic business case constrains producers' desire to hold accessible performances. We identified many barriers to audiences booking for performances, and the possibility of a 'Catch-22': that improved return on investment from holding accessible performances requires enough accessible performances to be scheduled to enable disabled people to develop and maintain a 'theatre habit'; until enough people develop this 'habit' accessible performances may actually lose the theatre money. In the current economic climate, without evidence that we are nearing this 'tipping point', progress towards it is stalling, as theatres 'lose their nerve' and fall back to levels of accessible performance provision that reflect a wish to prevent legal risk to the theatre rather than to develop the audiences for accessible performances.\n\nThis is disappointing because we found evidence that audiences who attend accessible theatre performances benefit from many of AHRC's components of cultural value, and that theatres that don't provide accessible performances may have an adverse effect on community cohesion as disabled audiences feel excluded from seeing shows other people are coming together around.\n\nOur research identified technological and organisational interventions that might shift these barriers, to enable accessible theatre to better benefit all its stakeholders - users, suppliers, theatres and funders alike. We are working on dissemination of our findings: through AHRC to the wider Cultural Value Project; back to the captioning and audio description suppliers; and through them to funding bodies like Arts Council England, to international Arts and Disability conferences, and to other research work in this area, such as the Warwick Commission's research into 'measuring cultural value'. \n\nWe are also investigating working with digital product makers, theatres and accessible performance suppliers to create tools to get round the barriers the research identified - to find solutions, created in collaboration with users, to the barriers that currently restrict the full realisation of the potential benefit to disabled theatregoers, theatres who hold performances, funding organisations, and society as a whole.
