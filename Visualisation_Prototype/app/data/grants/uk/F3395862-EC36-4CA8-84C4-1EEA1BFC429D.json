{"id":"F3395862-EC36-4CA8-84C4-1EEA1BFC429D","title":"Well-Being Moral Imagination and Occult Consultation in Botwsana","abstractText":"<p>This project in visual anthropology, primarily in Botswana's capital, completes a long-term ethnographic study, including research on village seances and the religious interpretation of affliction.&nbsp;The main interest is in occult consultation as an artful, morally charged process of subjection and inter-subjective argumentation and self-discovery. How do urban villagers adopt new alternatives generated in the city, when encountering an urban faith-healing, charismatic church? </p>\n\n<p>A starting point is the theory of what anthropologists call dividualism (as against individualism). Urban villagers feel their very well-being is affected by significant others with whom they are deeply interdependent. Such mutual sociality is compelling, even when they strive for individualism, for being autonomous. How do they bring moral rhetoric and personal knowledge to bear through urban consultations redirecting tensions between individualism and dividualism? The use of a case-study method documents the revision of past knowledge to make moral sense of current predicaments. The envisioned method shows informants film&nbsp;their comments and responses and catches their reflections on camera. Such co-viewing is sustained with the same main subjects over a period of years in a cumulative series of films to produce an extended visual biography along with written texts.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2483","grantId":"RES-000-22-2483","fundValue":"77755","fundStart":"2007-07-01","fundEnd":"2010-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Richard  Werbner","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
