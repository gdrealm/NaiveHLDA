With an ageing population, it is important that all older people are treated with dignity, respect and have equal access to services. </p>\n\n<p>The PPIP Project is designed to transfer the recommendations generated in the existing work to key stakeholders in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets and beyond. It entails a sequence of events, a dissemination day-conference, two workshops and a showcase conference that aim to empower local practitioners, service providers and other stakeholders; to encourage them to think about their delivery of services and to create their own ways of improving these for older LGB adults. </p>\n\n<p>The project will be disseminated nationally to help facilitate the development of good practices and ensure that the services provided and supported by local authorities benefit all of their residents, regardless of an individual's sexual orientation.&nbsp; <br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/I002693/1","grantId":"ES/I002693/1","fundValue":"30190","fundStart":"2010-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Andrew Douglas King","coPersons":["Ann  Cronin"],"organisation":"Kingston University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
