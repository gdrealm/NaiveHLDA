One theory is that such people are dogged by a perverse desire to verify their negative identities, aimed at preserving intrapsychic coherence and retaining interpersonal predictability/control. Some empirical evidence supports this theory. For example, people with negative self-views choose critical over flattering feedback when given the choice. Yet such evidence remains equivocal: credibility judgments alone may explain such choices, as people with negative identities may deem only critical feedback worthy of consideration.</p>\n\n<p>A mixture of laboratory-based and applied research seeks to definitively settle the question. Using both open-ended and close-ended measures, it explores the reasons people give for choosing between positive and negative feedback concerning their identities, both global and specific. It also tests whether such choices and reasons vary as a function of experimental manipulations of predictability/control. In another paradigm, peopleâ€™s reactions to the prospect of losing or gaining identity features are systematically explored.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, the research examines whether the feedback choices of medical patients and the long-term unemployed reflect verification strivings or credibility judgments. The overall goal is to understand how people might best overcome barriers to positive identity change.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J019194/1","grantId":"ES/J019194/1","fundValue":"257311","fundStart":"2013-01-01","fundEnd":"2016-06-15","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Aiden Patrick Gregg","coPersons":["Constantine  Sedikides"],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
