The SSL technology will be used to further develop filters for particulate removal in high temperature energy generating applications such as incineration, gasification and power generation and will result in lower energy costs and cleaner emissions. This proprietary filtration platform technology is based on a novel formation of conical pores within ceramic filters and which can be tailored to suit a wide range of different markets and industrial applications. A variety of low durability technologies are currently used for removal of particulates and chemical pollutants in these and industrial sectors.\n\nWith the current lack of efficient, durable, high temperature high-throughput filtration technologies available, alternatives such as wet-scrubbing have been used to circumvent these limitations, but those increase the associated cost and generate further waste. The excellent chemical and thermal resistance of SSL's filters should be well suited to applications in both syngas and flue emissions treatment. It is also possible to integrate particulate and chemicals removal into a single multifunctional system and infrastructure and running costs can therefore be dramatically reduced.\n\nAt Surrey, membrane filters will be functionalized, characterized and tested in application. Functionalization will involve a range of approaches, including wash coating with oxidation catalysts (as in car exhausts) and also examination of the potential for involvement of cermets and of ionically conductive ceramics (both stable at high temperatures).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/N509930/1","grantId":"EP/N509930/1","fundValue":"109027","fundStart":"2016-02-01","fundEnd":"2017-01-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Robert Charles Slade","coPersons":["David  Watson"],"organisation":"University of Surrey","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
