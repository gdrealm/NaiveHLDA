{"id":"8B372492-C68B-47D7-B443-4431850DE3CB","title":"Un-Cartesian Linguistics","abstractText":"A guiding philosophical intuition on the nature of language for 400 years has been that language is a more or less deficient medium for expressing our thoughts. Linguistic signs are arbitrary and regulated by convention. \nThis view is a decisive component of the general, or rational, grammars arising in the 17 century, whose axiomatic basis is in essential ways taken over by modern linguistics and the Chomskyan project of generative (universal) grammar. We argue that this early modern, Cartesian axiomatics is at the root of a number of theoretical and empirical impasses in current linguistic theory. We develop another, non-rationalist, conception of universal grammar, which is historically inspired by a second, today largely forgotten, universal grammar tradition, the late medieval monistic grammars. These are guided by the leading idea that language is non-hereditary: \nThe organization of the linguistic sign is the organization of thought, with both organizations reflecting the structure of the real. The project assembles a group of researcher's currently spearheading the view of language as a generator of human thoughts. We aim to seamlessly merge linguistics and philosophy so as to make steps towards a new field where axiomatic assumptions of a philosophical character are recognized as feeding info theoretical linguistic, typological, and neuron linguistic research, and where such research feeds back into philosophy.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/H50009X/1","grantId":"AH/H50009X/1","fundValue":"173586","fundStart":"2009-10-01","fundEnd":"2012-10-04","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Wolfram  Hinzen","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Durham University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
