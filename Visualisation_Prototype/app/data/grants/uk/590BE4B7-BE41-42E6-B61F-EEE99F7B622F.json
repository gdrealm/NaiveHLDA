{"id":"590BE4B7-BE41-42E6-B61F-EEE99F7B622F","title":"The roles of C. elegans patched family genes in cell division","abstractText":"This project focuses on a cell biological process called cytokinesis. When a cell divides into 2 daughter cells, it first replicates its genetic material, so that each daughter cell inherits the same number of chromosomes and DNA content as its parent. Subsequently, the duplicated genetic material is evenly partitioned between what will become the 2 new daughter cells. During the terminal stages of cell division, the partitioning of the parental cell into daughter cells is completed when a constriction arises that physically separates the parental cell into two daughter cells - the process of cytokinesis. Thus, it is clear that understanding the mechanisms underlying cytokinesis is a fundamental problem in cell biology, and has consequences with regard to cell proliferation, developmental biology and cancer, as discussed below. We have identified a gene, named ptr-2 (for patched-related), which is required for cytokinesis in the model organism, the nematode C. elegans. C. elegans is a small transparent non-pathogenic worm, which is a widely used in biomedical studies because it possesses a number of experimental advantages, including the ability to grow large numbers at low cost. The lifecycle of the worm from egg to adult takes only 3 days, which makes it possible to analyse the effects of genetic mutation very rapidly. The worm was the first multicellular animal with a fully sequenced genome, so it is known that over 70% of genes associated with human disease are also present in the worm. However, the interpretation of gene function is often simplified in the worm because it only has ~1000 cells. Using a technique known as RNA mediated interference (RNAi), we have shown that the depletion or absence of ptr-2 causes cells of the early C. elegans embryo to have a cytokinesis defect. Cytokinesis defects are usually detected because a cell has multiple nuclei arising from the failure to partition the parental cell into daughter cells at each cell division. The involvement of ptr-2 in this process is of particular interest, because it is related to another gene, which encodes a protein named Patched (Ptch). In human cells, Ptch is a tumour suppressor, because the loss of Ptch activity causes both familial and sporadic carcinomas; mutations in Ptch are the leading cause of skin cancer. Defects in Ptch activity can also lead to developmental abnormalities. Hence an understanding of how the Ptch protein functions is important from both a cell biological standpoint and also from the perspective of human development and disease. To understand how ptr-2 affects cytokinesis, we are proposing to take a genetic approach by first analysing how the absence of ptr-2 affects cytokinesis. By determining what aspects of cell division are perturbed by the absence of ptr-2, we can then apply genetic logic to infer the normal role of ptr-2 in the cell. To make this analysis possible, we have obtained a genetic mutant that lacks the ptr-2 gene. Other clues that can help us to understand how ptr-2 affects cytokinesis and cell division will be obtained by determining where the PTR-2 protein is found in the cell. Protein localisation can be performed in either fixed cells using antibodies or in living cells using a fluorescent reporter, such as the green fluorescent protein from the jellyfish, fused to PTR-2. The PTR-2::GFP fusion can be detected in cells by shining light of the appropriate wavelength. This technique has the advantage that we can follow the behaviour of PTR-2::GFP by microscopic time-lapse recording during the course of an entire cell-division cycle. Once we know how PTR-2 behaves in the cell, we can then make and test predictions regarding the identity of other proteins that could interact with PTR-2. The outcome of this project is that we will expand our knowledge of the cell biology of cell division and also gain an improved understanding of the biochemical activities of Patched proteins.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F022190/1","grantId":"BB/F022190/1","fundValue":"313408","fundStart":"2008-09-01","fundEnd":"2012-02-29","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Patricia  Kuwabara","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":" This is a preliminary report of our findings. We have investigated the role of the C. elegans ptr-2 gene in early development and have shown that it is an essential gene. The absence of ptr-2 activity was explored by RNAi and through the use of deletion mutants. We found that ptr-2 is required early in the developing embryo (maternal contribution) and also later during post-embryonic development (zygotic contribution). Analysis of the embryonic ptr-2 phenotype revealed multiple defects in cell division. In particular, we identified cells with defects in cytokinesis. However, further investigation has led us to postulate that these defects could be attributed to problems in osmolarity, caused by a defective egg shell. We are continuing to pursue this line of analysis. \n\n\n\nWe have analysed the intracellular localization of PTR-2 protein using a PTR-2::mRFP rescuing transgene and antibodies. We find that PTR-2 shows a pattern of expression virtually identical to caveolin-1. PTR-2 was observed to internalise during meiosis II as sub-cortical puncta. We interpret these results to indicate that PTR-2 is either involved in synthesis/regulation of cortical granule cargo that is delivered at anaphase I, or in at post-anaphase I event that is important for establishing eggshell impermeability. A paper is in preparation reporting these results as a collaboration with researchers at the Ludwig Institute in La Jolla. In parallel with these studies, we have also analysed the role of PTC-3, which is a homologue of PTR-2. We used PTC-3 to test the importance of domains that are shared with PTR-2. We show that an RND transporter domain is required for the activity of PTC-3, whereas the SSD is not essential. A publication has resulted from this study. By screening for chemical mimetics of ptr-2, it might be possible to develop nematicides, which kill parasitic nematodes as embryos; however, this is not an immediate outcome and would involve a long term effort. Nonetheless, it would be beneficial to develop ways to disrupt the permeability barrier created by the eggshell, because this would provide an important route for eradicating nematode infections. It is possible that the permeability defect will aid in the application of drugs and inhibitors to study early development; however, the subsequent embryonic arrest would have to be monitored in the context of any study. It would be of interest to pursue a further study of the interaction between PTR-2 and caveolin-1 in the context of lipid and sterol trafficking.
