Although the literature highlights many positive outcomes of choice, more recent research has suggested that increasing choice can have negative consequences. As perceived control is central to a variety of desired health outcomes, this research aims to explore the paradox that increased choice may lead to diminished perceived control. Contexts relating to both the ‘chooser’ (eg ambivalence and anticipated regret) and the ‘choice provider’ (eg their accountability and trustworthiness) may affect this. The choice/ control relationship will be explored in three studies located in primary healthcare settings. An interview study will allow a qualitative exploration of this. Two experimental studies will systematically manipulate choice and the contextual variables identified above in order to explore the impact of this upon perceived control.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-1658","grantId":"RES-000-22-1658","fundValue":"46912","fundStart":"2006-08-01","fundEnd":"2007-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Jane  Ogden","coPersons":["Julie  Barnett"],"organisation":"University of Surrey","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
