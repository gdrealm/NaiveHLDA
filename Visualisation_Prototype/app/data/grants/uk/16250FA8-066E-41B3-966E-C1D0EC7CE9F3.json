{"id":"16250FA8-066E-41B3-966E-C1D0EC7CE9F3","title":"Dr Natalia Rulyova","abstractText":"It is proposed to develop a genre studies network which will stimulate new debate across disciplinary, theoretical, methodological, and international boundaries via a series of six workshops. This project is conceived as a stepping stone towards developing the first UK Centre for Genre Studies. Since antiquity the concept of genre which was first developed by Plato and Aristotle has gone through numerous translations from one culture to another, one medium to another, or from one discipline to another. In the process of translation, genres can transform, mutate, adapt to new conditions. Sometimes it leads to the emergence of new genres which usually appear as a result of cross-fertilisation and hybridisation. However, the relevance of the concept has never disappeared and if anything it has grown, especially in the context of new media in which humans have to process information faster than ever before. Genre, as taxonomy, is a helpful tool for creating meaning and making sense out of reality. Hence, the notion of genre needs to be reviewed in light of recent technological developments and the advent of Twitter, facebook, the blogosphere and other media. Since the classic triad of genres was defined (epic, tragic, comedy), the number of genres has grown exponentially to include new literary, music, cinematic, television, media, and other genres. Genre is a fundamentally cross-disciplinary category, which needs to be studied with the help of disciplinary and inter-disciplinary approaches.\n\nThe pilot workshop Genre in Contemporary Russian Culture, which was funded by CEELBAS and held at the Centre for Russian and East European Studies, the University of Birmingham (27 June 2011) has successfully demonstrated the fruitfulness of genre studies when applied to the study of one culture. The current project aims to extend genre studies approaches to European cultures. The six proposed workshops will focus on six main themes: theories of genre and methodologies applied to the study of genre, genre in translation, genre and new technologies, genre and gender, genre and the canons of representations, communicating the genre (the author, the text and the audience). All workshops will draw on the expertise of leading UK and international scholars from across the fields of modern foreign languages, literary, cultural, media, film and gender studies, the arts and visual culture. Academics will be encouraged to develop multidisciplinary approaches to genre in broader cultural contexts and to work in cooperation with practitioners who will contribute to discussion of genre at roundtables. To attract broader public interest, the series will be opened by the talk given by Sam Leith, an award-nominated UK writer and columnist, who, in his recent book You Talkin' to Me? Rhetoric from Aristotle to Obama (Profile Books, 2011) touches on the issues of genre in an enlightening and humorous fashion. The guest speaker at the last workshop will be the eminent Russian detective writer and translator Boris Akunin whose recent novel Quest was written in the new genre of an online book or a 'book-game', as the author calls it (see http://www.elkniga.ru/akunin/).\n\nThe project will have a dedicated webpage which will promote all events organised as part of the project and provide links to other relevant activities. All project developments will also be disseminated via Twitter. Among other project outputs, there will be the selected podcasts of academic papers and talks given by guest speakers, a special issue on genre studies in an academic refereed journal, 'Notes for Teachers on Genre' disseminated via the webpage, and a conference paper written by the principal investigator and published on the project webpage. Among potential beneficiaries of the project there will be library professionals and readers (workshops 1,2,6), school teachers (1) and gallery professionals (5), translators (4), new media practitioners (3), and the Russian Diaspora (6).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/K000160/1","grantId":"AH/K000160/1","fundValue":"25949","fundStart":"2012-09-01","fundEnd":"2013-09-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  The outcomes of the Genre Studies Network grant have been useful to the following professional groups and members of the general public:\n1) Writers and readers. The opening workshop launched a fruitful dialogue between the practicing writer and journalist Sam Leith (London) who wrote a popular book about rhetoric (You Talkin' to Me? Rhetoric from Aristotle to Obama) and the leading Professor in Rhetorical Studies Carolyn Miller (North Carolina, USA). The members of the workshop and virtual audience (both presentations are available to be viewed at http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/schools/lcahm/departments/russian/events/2012/workshop-1.aspx and via the Facebook GSN page https://www.facebook.com/#!/ ) were presented with complimentary views on genre: Leith's professional view on genre as a journalist, Leith's understanding of genre based on his research into classical rhetoric and Miller's understanding of genre as 'social action'. The workshop demonstrated an effective exchange of knowledge between literary practitioners and academics, as well as knowledge dissemination to wider general public. The dialogue has had an impact on the way in which writers, general public and scholars can apply the term 'genre' in their daily practice. \n\n2) Library staff. The main beneficiary of the GSN outcomes is the Birmingham Central Library. Sue Wilkinson, Events and Engagement Manager, participated in the work of the GSN. She discussed ways in which genre is defined and applied in daily practice by library staff and readers. In response, she learnt about new and challenging notions of genre - as social action. As the Birmingham Central Library has since moved into a new extraordinary building, these new ways of thinking about genre are particularly useful. How has the role of the library changed in the city landscape? How do people use the library? The old questions (such as 'What genres do people read?') need to be repalced with new ones provoked by new research into genre, such as 'In what genres do people use the library?'. The answer to that question is in relating genre to social action. Genre has had an impact on how librarians can analyse and improve their services to readers. \n3) Museum and film archive professionals. The main beneficiary in this category was the British Film Institute. Two BFI practitioners Jose de Esteban and Natasha Fairbairn participated in the GSN work. They exchanged their knowledge and use of genre in their daily practice at the Film archive with leading academics in Genre Studies and other members of the fifth workshop which took place in London. As in the case with the impact on the Birmingham Central library, it is likely that the relatively new understanding of genre as social action promoted by Prof. Charles Bazerman in the workshop with the BFI practitioners would have an impact on the ways in which archival work can be organised.\n4) Educators. The forthcoming edited volume Genre Trajectories (to be published by Palgrave in 2015), which will be based on papers given at seven GSN workshops, will contain two chapters which will engage with the use of genre theories in the classroom at school and at the university, sharing some international experience from Canada to Denmark. The chapters will have impact on teaching practice in Europe and North America, at least.\n5) Translators and new media practitioners. The PI's examination of how people use new technologies, such as smart phones and Dashboard cameras, in different countries with a particular focus on Russia, in order to record an extraordinary event and how this is interpreted in the English-language mass media (the chapter will be published in the Emerging Genres in New Media Environments volume edited by Carolyn Miller by Routledge in 2015) is likely to have some impact on how (1) media practitioners understand the 'news' as a genre; (2) how they translate news stories into foreign languages. \n6) Artists. Kate Nolan, an independent artist, presented her Photobook Neither, a narrative of Kalinigrad women, to GSN participants. Her work challenges the traditional boundaries between genres and explores not only practical but also theoretical implications of the emergence of new genres. Her dialogue with scholars has had impact on her work as well as her book (which has since been published) will have impact on reading and viewing public.

The Genre Studies Network GSN) has brought together scholars who represent these two approaches to genre. \nThe volume Genre Trajectories: Identifying, Mapping and Projecting, which is based on the papers given at seven GSN workshops, will contain chapters on genre theories and methodologies as they are applied from the two perspectives. Gunther Kress, Natasha Artemeva and Don Myles, and Anne Smedegaard will discuss genre as it relates to social reality. Their theories and methodologies originate in pedagogical studies but go far beyond them, especially in Kress's theoretical development of the fundamental notion of genre and how it reflects technological advancements in social reality. Antonio Sanchez, Sarah Parker, Lesley Stevenson will, on the other hand, continue the conversation about genre by drawing on more traditional literary definitions of genre. Sarah Parker will scrutinise the relationship between genre and gender by analysing the female poetic identity in lyric poetry. Peter Buse will investigate the ways, in which genres change and mutate with the advent of new technologies by focusing on the new genre of selfie in relation to the age-old portrait. Simone Schroth will discuss changes that have occurred to literary genres as a result of developments in new media by looking at email novels.\nThe GSN has identified productive links between genre studies and memory studies. An extra, the 7th workshop, was organised in collaboration with two Memory Studies groups at the University of Birmingham and the University of Nottingham. Beatrice Damamme-Gilbert's and Katya Krylova's contributions to Genre Trajectories will testify the usefulness of genre approaches in research in memory.\nRulyova has written a chapter for the volume Emerging Genres in New Media Environments (edited by Carolyn Miller, forthcoming in 2015, Routledge) on the use of new technological devices (mobile phones, smart phones, dashboard cameras, etc.), genres (stories, jokes, etc.) and media platforms (Youtube, Facebook, Twitter, etc.) by ordinary Russian citizens. The research for this chapter has led to new important research questions, in particular, about our changing understanding of the news as a genre. We need to explore how citizens in different geo-political environments and linguistic cultures receive, identify, disseminate and create news stories, especially with the advent of new media. With the emergence of the active new media user, it is my hypothesis that the user determines what the news is and, therefore, news items could appear in a greater variety of genres (a post on the Facebook, a tweet, a selfie etc.), not only traditional media news genres (news report, article, etc.). To further explore these questions, Rulyova, in collaboration with John McNight, the University of Lancaster, will be applying for funding to carry out research on the news as a genre. \nIn the course of the project, several new productive collaborations have emerged: between Rulyova, the GSN, and Natasha Artemeva at Carleton University, Canada; between Rulyova, the GSN, and Carolyn Miller, the University of North Carolina, the USA; between Rulyova, the GSN and University of Fortaleza, Brazil.\nThe GSN was at the epicentre of genre research and timely, having added to the rise of interest in genre studies in 2010-14. The outputs of genre activities in these years will include a cluster of three edited volumes on genre to be published in 2015, including Rulyova and Dowd, Genre Trajectories (Palgrave); Miller, Emerging Genres in New Media Environments (Routledge), and Artemeva, Genre 2012 (Inkshed Publication). Academic routes:\nIn collaboration with John McNight, Rulyova will further explore our changing understanding of the news as a genre, drawing on genre as social action and audience studies. McNight and Rulyova intend to apply for funding to carry out this international, inter- and cross-disciplinary project to study how news items are distributed, identified and created in a variety of genres, media and new technologies.\nFurther collaboration is planned with the University of Fortaleza which has become a centre for genre studies in Brazil (SIGET symposium in 2013). The first Brazilian PhD student is visiting the University of Birmingham in September-November 2014. Further visits and potential academic exchanges are being considered. Brazilian academic partners are potentially interested to take part in the news project.\nFollowing his participation in the GSN Workshop Canons of Representation, Prof. Uffelmann organised The i-Rhetoric in Russian: Performing the Self through Mobile Technology conference at the University of Passau, Germany, on 12-14 June 2014. Rulyova was invited to give a talk on identity, genre and social media at the conference. Since then, Prof. Uffelmann invited Rulyova to participate in the roundtable on Digital Rhetoric in Russian at the ICCEES in Japan on 3 August 2015.\nNon-academic routes:\nContacts will be maintained with the Birmingham Central Library, the British Film Institute and Kate Nolan, an independent artist. It is planned to get in touch with all of them in spring 2015 to find out whether their practices have been impacted by the GSN outputs.\nAfter the publication of Genre Trajectories, it is planned to send an overview and the reviews of the volume to secondary schools in Birmingham, with the note describing the potential impact of genre studies on pedagogy.
