The period to be reviewed is of great interest, as it is demonstrable that credit relationships between the English crown and Italian merchant societies supported the efficient running of the English government and financed a succession of wars. The study will transcribe and translate the sources of agreements between Edwards I, II and III and their various creditors over the period 1272-1340 in order to build a numerical record of the timings of borrowings and repayments, including, where available, details of “favours” or side payments. From this, a technique for the analysis of the implied interest rates payable will be created. We expect to be able to show that modern financial practices for managing governmental expenses were utilised by a succession of medieval monarchs. These findings will also draw out parallels with modern banking crises that have affected certain developing countries.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-0733","grantId":"RES-062-23-0733","fundValue":"286576","fundStart":"2007-12-01","fundEnd":"2010-11-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Chris  Brooks","coPersons":["Adrian  Bell"],"organisation":"University of Reading","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
