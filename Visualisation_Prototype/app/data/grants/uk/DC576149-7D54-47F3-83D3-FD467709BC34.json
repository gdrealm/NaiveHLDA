If genes are not switched off when necessary, cells can continue to multiply in an uncontrolled way leading to cancer. As well as being important in cancer, gene regulation is crucial in controlling the balance between stem cell self-renewal and pathways to cell specialisation which are required to form the particular cells and tissues in the body. Since stem cells have a vast potential in regenerative medicine for the replacement of defective tissue, the understanding of gene control is crucial for harnessing the potential of these cells. Therefore studying the mechanisms whereby genes are switched off (as well as on) is vitally important for providing basic knowledge that has potential to lead to novel therapeutics. Using the fruit fly Drosophila as a model organism, we have recently discovered that an enzyme named Pacman is involved in the growth and differentiation of imaginal discs, which form adult structures such as wings and legs. Imaginal discs are similar to stem cells in that they carry the information to build the adult tissue. We have shown that Pacman normally affects the production of a protein called Simjang (Korean for 'strong heart') which in turn controls a gene silencing complex (the NuRD complex) which shuts down parts of the chromosome, preventing genes from being turned on. This gene silencing complex is important because it is known to be involved in many critical cellular events including tissue regeneration, formation of blood cells, ageing and spread of cancer cells. This is the first time that an enzyme involved in degradation of messenger RNA has been shown to be directly affecting a gene silencing complex. The aim of this project is to understand how the Pacman uses Simjang to control particular sets of genes involved in growth and differentiation. Our hypothesis is that, in normal cells, simjang messenger RNA is somehow 'tagged' for destruction so that not much of Simjang protein is made. This means that there is not enough Simjang to turn on the gene silencing complexes. These gene silencing complexes, when activated, normally act as 'brakes' to prevent growth and differentiation of the wing disc. Therefore when the brake is not pressed by Simjang, these genes are not turned on, allowing normal growth and development of the tissue. When the pacman gene is mutated, there is no (or little) degradation of simjang RNA, resulting in more Simjang protein, which turns on the gene silencing complexes (i.e. presses the brake) therefore switching on genes that prevent tissue growth and development. In this project we aim to test this hypothesis, find out the details of this gene control pathway and identify the genes which act as brakes to prevent growth and development. The mechanism of gene regulation which forms the basis of this proposal is entirely novel; as yet no research group has found this link between RNA degradation and gene silencing. Since all the proteins involved are similar in Drosophila and humans the new 'control module' we have discovered is likely to be relevant to gene regulation in humans. Since Pacman is known to be important in other important cellular events such as wound healing, migration of cell sheets, and male fertility, this work may also shed light on the molecular mechanisms of these processes in other tissues. Therefore the insights we gain during this project may help us to improve treatment for cancer and other diseases and also help us to understand the ways that tissues grow and develop. This project will therefore provide valuable insights into a new method of gene regulation which can be used in the development of new therapeutics.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I021345/1","grantId":"BB/I021345/1","fundValue":"447194","fundStart":"2011-11-01","fundEnd":"2015-04-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  1. Application and Exploitation\nOur current and previous BBSRC-funded research has resulted in significant Impact regarding commercialising outputs of our research. To date, this is mainly in the form of commercialisation of microRNA biomarkers for use in prognosis/diagnosis of human disease. The research of my group has caught the interest of many clinicians in BSMS resulting in a number of ongoing collaborations (listed below). In particular, my collaborator Tim Chevassut and I have obtained funding from the University of Sussex Enterprise Fund to develop microRNA biomarkers from the blood cancer myeloma. This has resulted in the application for a world-wide patent of 3 microRNA biomarkers. IP issues are being managed through the University of Sussex offices and the Sussex Innovation Centre are dealing with the marketing. A number of Industrial partners are interested in our research and, together with colleagues in the Sussex Innovation centre, I have liased with them with a view to a licencing the product. Therefore, my group is familiar with the process of commercialisation and is regarded as something of a success story! (see http://www.sinc.co.uk/business-directory/89/index.html).\n\n2. Collaboration and Co-production\nAs the project is being carried out in a Medical School, there is ample opportunity for interaction with Medical Colleagues in collaborative research. This has already resulted in the following established and ongoing collaborations:\n1. Dr Tim Chevassut (BSMS): microRNAs as biomarkers in myeloma. The Sussex Innovation Centre are at present helping us to find an Industrial partner.\n2. Dr Martin Llewelyn and Dr Stefano Caserta (BSMS): microRNAs as biomarkers in sepsis and toxic shock. My BBSRC-funded postdocs taught Dr Llewelyn's postdocs the methods required for miRNA analysis. Dr Caserta is at present narrowing down the useful miRNA biomarkers for diagnostic use.\n3. Prof. Tony Metcalfe (Blond McIndoe Research Foundation, East Grinstead): microRNAs as biomarkers in melanoma. I have been awarded a BBSRC &amp;quot;Sparking Impact&amp;quot; award for this work to fund patent searches, marketing, a workshop and for a postdoc (Dr Sarah Smalley) to liase with Industry. We have a formal collaboration agreement and an MTA agreement to support this work. Dr Smalley is working part-time in my lab and is benefiting from the expertise of my postdocs.\n4. Prof. Jackie Cassell (BSMS and BSUHT): microRNAs as biomarkers in scabies infection. This is a new project funded by the &amp;quot;Public Health for England&amp;quot; which aims to diagnose and follow scabies outbreaks in Care Homes for the elderly. \n5. Dr Matthew Pead (Royal Vet College), Dr Imelda McGonnell (Royal Vet College) and Dr Kenneth Rankin (University of Newcastle): Role of XRN1 in osteosarcoma in humans and domestic dogs. This is a new collaboration where we at present are setting up the collaboration agreements and MTAs. Pacman/XRN1 are potentially novel drug targets for this childhood and canine cancer.\n\n3. Communications and engagement\n(a) Communication with Stakehoders.\nA workshop on biomarkers funded by the BBSRC Sparking Impact Award, is to take place early in the New Year. This is primarily aimed at Clinicians and Industrialists. \n(e) Schools and public engagement\nI have regularly hosted a school student in my lab to introduce them to RNA Research and will continue to do so. We will also organise a School visit to talk to the children about Genetics. In addition, groups of parents are invited for lab tours during the open days for Medical Students which take place each year. \n(d) Websites and interactive media.\nThe work of my group is often chosen by the BSMS public engagement offices to be published in a way that is accessible to the general audience. Research news, together with brief explanations of research in layman's language, is regularly published on the BSMS Website.

Imaginal discs are similar to stem cells in that they carry the information to build the adult tissue. The aim of this project is to understand how the Pacman targets particular sets of genes involved in growth and differentiation.\n\nThe key findings, to date, are as follows:\n\n1. Whole-genome transcriptomic analyses have shown that a rather small number of mRNAs and miRNAs are substantially increased or decreased in levels in pcm5 mutant discs. Of these misexpressed mRNAs, we have identified four that are upregulated at the post-transcriptional level in pcm5 mutants, suggesting that they could be directly affected by the Pacman exoribonuclease. These transcripts include one that encodes the heat-shock protein Hsp67Bc, which is upregulated 11.9-fold at the post-transcriptional level and 2.3-fold at the protein level. One miRNA, miR-277-3p, was post-transcriptionally downregulated, which is consistent with Pacman being specifically involved in the biogenesis of this miRNA. Since Hsp67Bc is known to regulate autophagy/apoptosis and protein synthesis, it is possible that Pacman may control the growth of wing imaginal discs by regulating these processes.\n\n2. Using Drosophila wing imaginal discs as a model system, we have demonstrated that a null mutation in pacman results in small imaginal discs as well as lethality during pupation. Mutant wing discs show an increase in the number of cells undergoing apoptosis (programmed cell death), especially in the wing pouch area. Compensatory proliferation also occurs in these mutant discs, but this is insufficient to compensate for the concurrent increase in apoptosis. The phenotypic effects of the pacman null mutation are rescued by a mutation that removes one copy of each of the pro-apoptotic genes reaper, hid and grim, demonstrating that pacman acts through this pathway. The null pacman mutation also results in a significant increase in the expression of the pro-apoptotic hid and reaper mRNAs, with this increase mostly occurring at the post-transcriptional level, suggesting that Pacman normally targets these mRNAs. Our results uncover a novel function for the conserved exoribonuclease Pacman and suggest that this exoribonuclease is important in the regulation of apoptosis in other organisms. A key question raised by the above work is whether hid, reaper (and other mRNAs identified by our analyses) are targeted directly by Pacman or are upregulated as an indirect effect. For example, Pacman could target a transcript encoding a RNA binding protein; in the mutant this RNA binding protein would then be expressed at higher levels, which could result in higher post-transcriptional levels of the mRNAs it regulates. To identify the direct targets of Pacman, the postdoc is carrying out a modified RIP experiment to immunoprecipitate Pacman with its bound mRNA targets. Initially he will use PCR to check for binding of candidate targets identified in the RNA-seq experiment. However, his main aim of the experiment is to use RNA-seq as an unbiased approach to complement the RNA-seq experiment. We then plan to publish these results.\n\nAn unforeseen consequence of the research carried out in the project is the relevance of the above research to the bone cancer osteosarcoma. The homologue of the Pacman gene in humans, XRN1, is downregulated in this cancer. We have obtained pump-priming funding to carry out initial work to understand how Pacman/XRN1, may contribute to osteosarcoma progression.
