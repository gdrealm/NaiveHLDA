Smoking contributes to the death of one in two of those who continue to smoke past 35 years of age. \nMobile phones allow personalised smoking cessation support programmes to be delivered inexpensively wherever the person is located. The New Zealand STOMP (stop smoking with mobile phones) trial found a doubling in quit rates at six weeks but provided no reliable data on long term effects. \nThe Txt2stop intervention is based on the STOMP programme, modified for use in the UK. To modify the intervention, youth smoking cessation counsellors and 62 potential participants reviewed all text messages in a series of focus groups. We have already conducted a pilot study among 200 participants. We achieved 93% long term follow up. The short term results show a doubling of quit rate (24% vs. 10%). \nThe Txt2stop trial among 5800 participants will establish the impact of mobile phone based smoking cessation support.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0601639","grantId":"G0601639","fundValue":"1697870","fundStart":"2007-08-01","fundEnd":"2010-07-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Caroline  Free","coPersons":["Robyn  Whittaker","Ian Gray Roberts","Anthony  Rodgers","Philip James Edwards","John  Cairns"],"organisation":"London Sch of Hygiene and Trop Medicine","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
