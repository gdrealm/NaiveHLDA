Malaria is a disease caused by infection with the parasite Plasmodium. The parasite has a complicated life-cycle, and lives in cells in the liver, and in red blood cells. Although several treatments to combat malaria exist, we still need to know more about how the parasite lives in humans in order to effectively control the disease. Plasmodium needs iron to survive, and obtains its iron from its human host. Investigating how this happens, and how iron influences the growth and life-cycle of the parasite, are the aims of this project. A better understanding of these issues may allow regulation of iron transport to inhibit Plasmodium, and benefit infected humans.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0901149","grantId":"G0901149","fundValue":"459784","fundStart":"2010-07-01","fundEnd":"2013-06-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Hal  Drakesmith","coPersons":["Chris  Newbold"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
