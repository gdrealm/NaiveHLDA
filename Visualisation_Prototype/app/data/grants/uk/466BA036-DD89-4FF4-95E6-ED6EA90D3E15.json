It sets out to place the series of glosses published between 1945 and 1948 as 'Aus dem Woterbuch des Unmenschen ' in their cultural and historical context, and by doing so to see these glosses and their authors in a new light. The book traces the development of the anti-fascist linguistic criticism of Dolf Sternberger (1907-1989), the driving force behind these glosses. It is argued that the expectance of 'inner emigration' was a decisive shaping factor.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=112713/1","grantId":"112713/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2006-01-15","fundEnd":"2006-05-14","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"William  Dodd","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
